I trust that my instincts are not awry\nwhen they prompt me to leave the account, in simplicity, as it was\nhanded to me.\n\nAnd the MS. itself--You must picture me, when first it was given into my\ncare, turning it over, curiously, and making a swift, jerky examination.\nA small book it is; but thick, and all, save the last few pages, filled\nwith a quaint but legible handwriting, and writ very close. I have the\nqueer, faint, pit-water smell of it in my nostrils now as I write, and\nmy fingers have subconscious memories of the soft, \"cloggy\" feel of the\nlong-damp pages.\n\nI read, and, in reading, lifted the Curtains of the Impossible that\nblind the mind, and looked out into the unknown. Amid stiff, abrupt\nsentences I wandered; and, presently, I had no fault to charge against\ntheir abrupt tellings; for, better far than my own ambitious phrasing,\nis this mutilated story capable of bringing home all that the old\nRecluse, of the vanished house, had striven to tell.\n\nOf the simple, stiffly given account of weird and extraordinary matters,\nI will say little. It lies before you. The inner story must be uncovered,\npersonally, by each reader, according to ability and desire. And even\nshould any fail to see, as now I see, the shadowed picture and conception\nof that to which one may well give the accepted titles of Heaven and Hell;\nyet can I promise certain thrills, merely taking the story as a story.\n\nWILLIAM HOPE HODGSON December 17, 1907\n\n\n\n_I_\n\nTHE FINDING OF THE MANUSCRIPT\n\nRight away in the west of Ireland lies a tiny hamlet called Kraighten.\nIt is situated, alone, at the base of a low hill. Far around there\nspreads a waste of bleak and totally inhospitable country; where, here\nand there at great intervals, one may come upon the ruins of some long\ndesolate cottage--unthatched and stark. The whole land is bare and\nunpeopled, the very earth scarcely covering the rock that lies beneath\nit, and with which the country abounds, in places rising out of the soil\nin wave-shaped ridges.\n\nYet, in spite of its desolation, my friend Tonnison and I had elected to\nspend our vacation there. He had stumbled on the place by mere chance\nthe year previously, during the course of a long walking tour, and\ndiscovered the possibilities for the angler in a small and unnamed river\nthat runs past the outskirts of the little village.\n\nI have said that the river is without name; I may add that no map that I\nhave hitherto consulted has shown either village or stream. They seem\nto have entirely escaped observation: indeed, they might never exist for\nall that the average guide tells one. Possibly this can be partly\naccounted for by the fact that the nearest railway station (Ardrahan) is\nsome forty miles distant.\n\nIt was early one warm evening when my friend and I arrived in Kraighten.\nWe had reached Ardrahan the previous night, sleeping there in rooms\nhired at the village post office, and leaving in good time on the\nfollowing morning, clinging insecurely to one of the typical\njaunting cars.\n\nIt had taken us all day to accomplish our journey over some of the\nroughest tracks imaginable, with the result that we were thoroughly\ntired and somewhat bad tempered. However, the tent had to be erected and\nour goods stowed away before we could think of food or rest. And so we\nset to work, with the aid of our driver, and soon had the tent up upon a\nsmall patch of ground just outside the little village, and quite near to\nthe river.\n\nThen, having stored all our belongings, we dismissed the driver, as he\nhad to make his way back as speedily as possible, and told him to come\nacross to us at the end of a fortnight. We had brought sufficient\nprovisions to last us for that space of time, and water we could get\nfrom the stream. Fuel we did not need, as we had included a small\noil-stove among our outfit, and the weather was fine and warm.\n\nIt was Tonnison's idea to camp out instead of getting lodgings in one of\nthe cottages. As he put it, there was no joke in sleeping in a room with\na numerous family of healthy Irish in one corner and the pigsty in the\nother, while overhead a ragged colony of roosting fowls distributed\ntheir blessings impartially, and the whole place so full of peat smoke\nthat it made a fellow sneeze his head off just to put it inside\nthe doorway.\n\nTonnison had got the stove lit now and was busy cutting slices of bacon\ninto the frying pan; so I took the kettle and walked down to the river\nfor water. On the way, I had to pass close to a little group of the\nvillage people, who eyed me curiously, but not in any unfriendly manner,\nthough none of them ventured a word.\n\nAs I returned with my kettle filled, I went up to them and, after a\nfriendly nod, to which they replied in like manner, I asked them\ncasually about the fishing; but, instead of answering, they just shook\ntheir heads silently, and stared at me. I repeated the question,\naddressing more particularly a great, gaunt fellow at my elbow; yet\nagain I received no answer. Then the man turned to a comrade and said\nsomething rapidly in a language that I did not understand; and, at once,\nthe whole crowd of them fell to jabbering in what, after a few moments,\nI guessed to be pure Irish. At the same time they cast many glances in\nmy direction. For a minute, perhaps, they spoke among themselves thus;\nthen the man I had addressed faced 'round at me and said something. By\nthe expression of his face I guessed that he, in turn, was questioning\nme; but now I had to shake my head, and indicate that I did not\ncomprehend what it was they wanted to know; and so we stood looking at\none another, until I heard Tonnison calling to me to hurry up with the\nkettle. Then, with a smile and a nod, I left them, and all in the little\ncrowd smiled and nodded in return, though their faces still betrayed\ntheir puzzlement.\n\nIt was evident, I reflected as I went toward the tent, that the\ninhabitants of these few huts in the wilderness did not know a word of\nEnglish; and when I told Tonnison, he remarked that he was aware of the\nfact, and, more, that it was not at all uncommon in that part of the\ncountry, where the people often lived and died in their isolated hamlets\nwithout ever coming in contact with the outside world.\n\n\"I wish we had got the driver to interpret for us before he left,\" I\nremarked, as we sat down to our meal. \"It seems so strange for the\npeople of this place not even to know what we've come for.\"\n\nTonnison grunted an assent, and thereafter was silent for a while.\n\nLater, having satisfied our appetites somewhat, we began to talk, laying\nour plans for the morrow; then, after a smoke, we closed the flap of the\ntent, and prepared to turn in.\n\n\"I suppose there's no chance of those fellows outside taking anything?\"\nI asked, as we rolled ourselves in our blankets.\n\nTonnison said that he did not think so, at least while we were about;\nand, as he went on to explain, we could lock up everything, except the\ntent, in the big chest that we had brought to hold our provisions. I\nagreed to this, and soon we were both asleep.\n\nNext morning, early, we rose and went for a swim in the river; after\nwhich we dressed and had breakfast. Then we roused out our fishing\ntackle and overhauled it, by which time, our breakfasts having settled\nsomewhat, we made all secure within the tent and strode off in the\ndirection my friend had explored on his previous visit.\n\nDuring the day we fished happily, working steadily upstream, and by\nevening we had one of the prettiest creels of fish that I had seen for a\nlong while. Returning to the village, we made a good feed off our day's\nspoil, after which, having selected a few of the finer fish for our\nbreakfast, we presented the remainder to the group of villagers who had\nassembled at a respectful distance to watch our doings. They seemed\nwonderfully grateful, and heaped mountains of what I presumed to be\nIrish blessings upon our heads.\n\nThus we spent several days, having splendid sport, and first-rate\nappetites to do justice upon our prey. We were pleased to find how\nfriendly the villagers were inclined to be, and that there was no\nevidence of their having ventured to meddle with our belongings during\nour absences.\n\nIt was on a Tuesday that we arrived in Kraighten, and it would be on the\nSunday following that we made a great discovery. Hitherto we had always\ngone up-stream; on that day, however, we laid aside our rods, and,\ntaking some provisions, set off for a long ramble in the opposite\ndirection. The day was warm, and we trudged along leisurely enough,\nstopping about mid-day to eat our lunch upon a great flat rock near the\nriverbank. Afterward we sat and smoked awhile, resuming our walk only\nwhen we were tired of inaction.\n\nFor perhaps another hour we wandered onward, chatting quietly and\ncomfortably on this and that matter, and on several occasions stopping\nwhile my companion--who is something of an artist--made rough sketches\nof striking bits of the wild scenery.\n\nAnd then, without any warning whatsoever, the river we had followed so\nconfidently, came to an abrupt end--vanishing into the earth.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" I said, \"who ever would have thought of this?\"\n\nAnd I stared in amazement; then I turned to Tonnison. He was looking,\nwith a blank expression upon his face, at the place where the river\ndisappeared.\n\nIn a moment he spoke.\n\n\"Let us go on a bit; it may reappear again--anyhow, it is worth\ninvestigating.\"\n\nI agreed, and we went forward once more, though rather aimlessly; for we\nwere not at all certain in which direction to prosecute our search. For\nperhaps a mile we moved onward; then Tonnison, who had been gazing about\ncuriously, stopped and shaded his eyes.\n\n\"See!\" he said, after a moment, \"isn't that mist or something, over\nthere to the right--away in a line with that great piece of rock?\" And\nhe indicated with his hand.\n\nI stared, and, after a minute, seemed to see something, but could not be\ncertain, and said so.\n\n\"Anyway,\" my friend replied, \"we'll just go across and have a glance.\"\nAnd he started off in the direction he had suggested, I following.\nPresently, we came among bushes, and, after a time, out upon the top of\na high, boulder-strewn bank, from which we looked down into a wilderness\nof bushes and trees.\n\n\"Seems as though we had come upon an oasis in this desert of stone,\"\nmuttered Tonnison, as he gazed interestedly. Then he was silent, his\neyes fixed; and I looked also; for up from somewhere about the center of\nthe wooded lowland there rose high into the quiet air a great column of\nhazelike spray, upon which the sun shone, causing innumerable rainbows.\n\n\"How beautiful!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Tonnison, thoughtfully. \"There must be a waterfall, or\nsomething, over there. Perhaps it's our river come to light again. Let's\ngo and see.\"\n\nDown the sloping bank we made our way, and entered among the trees and\nshrubberies. The bushes were matted, and the trees overhung us, so that\nthe place was disagreeably gloomy; though not dark enough to hide from\nme the fact that many of the trees were fruit trees, and that, here and\nthere, one could trace indistinctly, signs of a long departed\ncultivation. Thus it came to me that we were making our way through the\nriot of a great and ancient garden. I said as much to Tonnison, and he\nagreed that there certainly seemed reasonable grounds for my belief.\n\nWhat a wild place it was, so dismal and somber! Somehow, as we went\nforward, a sense of the silent loneliness and desertion of the old\ngarden grew upon me, and I felt shivery. One could imagine things\nlurking among the tangled bushes; while, in the very air of the place,\nthere seemed something uncanny. I think Tonnison was conscious of this\nalso, though he said nothing.\n\nSuddenly, we came to a halt. Through the trees there had grown upon our\nears a distant sound. Tonnison bent forward, listening. I could hear it\nmore plainly now; it was continuous and harsh--a sort of droning roar,\nseeming to come from far away. I experienced a queer, indescribable,\nlittle feeling of nervousness. What sort of place was it into which we\nhad got? I looked at my companion, to see what he thought of the matter;\nand noted that there was only puzzlement in his face; and then, as I\nwatched his features, an expression of comprehension crept over them,\nand he nodded his head.\n\n\"That's a waterfall,\" he exclaimed, with conviction. \"I know the sound\nnow.\" And he began to push vigorously through the bushes, in the\ndirection of the noise.\n\nAs we went forward, the sound became plainer continually, showing that\nwe were heading straight toward it. Steadily, the roaring grew louder\nand nearer, until it appeared, as I remarked to Tonnison, almost to come\nfrom under our feet--and still we were surrounded by the trees\nand shrubs.\n\n\"Take care!\" Tonnison called to me. \"Look where you're going.\" And then,\nsuddenly, we came out from among the trees, on to a great open space,\nwhere, not six paces in front of us, yawned the mouth of a tremendous\nchasm, from the depths of which the noise appeared to rise, along with\nthe continuous, mistlike spray that we had witnessed from the top of the\ndistant bank.\n\nFor quite a minute we stood in silence, staring in bewilderment at the\nsight; then my friend went forward cautiously to the edge of the abyss.\nI followed, and, together, we looked down through a boil of spray at a\nmonster cataract of frothing water that burst, spouting, from the side\nof the chasm, nearly a hundred feet below.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" said Tonnison.\n\nI was silent, and rather awed. The sight was so unexpectedly grand and\neerie; though this latter quality came more upon me later.\n\nPresently, I looked up and across to the further side of the chasm.\nThere, I saw something towering up among the spray: it looked like a\nfragment of a great ruin, and I touched Tonnison on the shoulder. He\nglanced 'round, with a start, and I pointed toward the thing. His gaze\nfollowed my finger, and his eyes lighted up with a sudden flash of\nexcitement, as the object came within his field of view.\n\n\"Come along,\" he shouted above the uproar. \"We'll have a look at it.\nThere's something queer about this place; I feel it in my bones.\" And he\nstarted off, 'round the edge of the craterlike abyss. As we neared this\nnew thing, I saw that I had not been mistaken in my first impression. It\nwas undoubtedly a portion of some ruined building; yet now I made out\nthat it was not built upon the edge of the chasm itself, as I had at\nfirst supposed; but perched almost at the extreme end of a huge spur of\nrock that jutted out some fifty or sixty feet over the abyss. In fact,\nthe jagged mass of ruin was literally suspended in midair.\n\nArriving opposite it, we walked out on to the projecting arm of rock,\nand I must confess to having felt an intolerable sense of terror as I\nlooked down from that dizzy perch into the unknown depths below us--into\nthe deeps from which there rose ever the thunder of the falling water\nand the shroud of rising spray.\n\nReaching the ruin, we clambered 'round it cautiously, and, on the\nfurther side, came upon a mass of fallen stones and rubble. The ruin\nitself seemed to me, as I proceeded now to examine it minutely, to be a\nportion of the outer wall of some prodigious structure, it was so thick\nand substantially built; yet what it was doing in such a position I\ncould by no means conjecture. Where was the rest of the house, or\ncastle, or whatever there had been?\n\nI went back to the outer side of the wall, and thence to the edge of the\nchasm, leaving Tonnison rooting systematically among the heap of stones\nand rubbish on the outer side. Then I commenced to examine the surface\nof the ground, near the edge of the abyss, to see whether there were not\nleft other remnants of the building to which the fragment of ruin\nevidently belonged. But though I scrutinized the earth with the greatest\ncare, I could see no signs of anything to show that there had ever been\na building erected on the spot, and I grew more puzzled than ever.\n\nThen, I heard a cry from Tonnison; he was shouting my name, excitedly,\nand without delay I hurried along the rocky promontory to the ruin. I\nwondered whether he had hurt himself, and then the thought came, that\nperhaps he had found something.\n\nI reached the crumbled wall and climbed 'round. There I found Tonnison\nstanding within a small excavation that he had made among the _debris_:\nhe was brushing the dirt from something that looked like a book, much\ncrumpled and dilapidated; and opening his mouth, every second or two, to\nbellow my name. As soon as he saw that I had come, he handed his prize\nto me, telling me to put it into my satchel so as to protect it from the\ndamp, while he continued his explorations. This I did, first, however,\nrunning the pages through my fingers, and noting that they were closely\nfilled with neat, old-fashioned writing which was quite legible, save in\none portion, where many of the pages were almost destroyed, being\nmuddied and crumpled, as though the book had been doubled back at that\npart. This, I found out from Tonnison, was actually as he had discovered\nit, and the damage was due, probably, to the fall of masonry upon the\nopened part. Curiously enough, the book was fairly dry, which I\nattributed to its having been so securely buried among the ruins.\n\nHaving put the volume away safely, I turned-to and gave Tonnison a hand\nwith his self-imposed task of excavating; yet, though we put in over an\nhour's hard work, turning over the whole of the upheaped stones and\nrubbish, we came upon nothing more than some fragments of broken wood,\nthat might have been parts of a desk or table; and so we gave up\nsearching, and went back along the rock, once more to the safety of\nthe land.\n\nThe next thing we did was to make a complete tour of the tremendous\nchasm, which we were able to observe was in the form of an almost\nperfect circle, save for where the ruin-crowned spur of rock jutted out,\nspoiling its symmetry.\n\nThe abyss was, as Tonnison put it, like nothing so much as a gigantic\nwell or pit going sheer down into the bowels of the earth.\n\nFor some time longer, we continued to stare about us, and then, noticing\nthat there was a clear space away to the north of the chasm, we bent our\nsteps in that direction.\n\nHere, distant from the mouth of the mighty pit by some hundreds of\nyards, we came upon a great lake of silent water--silent, that is, save\nin one place where there was a continuous bubbling and gurgling.\n\nNow, being away from the noise of the spouting cataract, we were able to\nhear one another speak, without having to shout at the tops of our\nvoices, and I asked Tonnison what he thought of the place--I told him\nthat I didn't like it, and that the sooner we were out of it the better\nI should be pleased.\n\nHe nodded in reply, and glanced at the woods behind furtively. I asked\nhim if he had seen or heard anything. He made no answer; but stood\nsilent, as though listening, and I kept quiet also.\n\nSuddenly, he spoke.\n\n\"Hark!\" he said, sharply. I looked at him, and then away among the trees\nand bushes, holding my breath involuntarily. A minute came and went in\nstrained silence; yet I could hear nothing, and I turned to Tonnison to\nsay as much; and then, even as I opened my lips to speak, there came a\nstrange wailing noise out of the wood on our left.... It appeared to\nfloat through the trees, and there was a rustle of stirring leaves, and\nthen silence.\n\nAll at once, Tonnison spoke, and put his hand on my shoulder. \"Let us\nget out of here,\" he said, and began to move slowly toward where the\nsurrounding trees and bushes seemed thinnest. As I followed him, it came\nto me suddenly that the sun was low, and that there was a raw sense of\nchilliness in the air.\n\nTonnison said nothing further, but kept on steadily. We were among the\ntrees now, and I glanced around, nervously; but saw nothing, save the\nquiet branches and trunks and the tangled bushes. Onward we went, and no\nsound broke the silence, except the occasional snapping of a twig under\nour feet, as we moved forward. Yet, in spite of the quietness, I had a\nhorrible feeling that we were not alone; and I kept so close to Tonnison\nthat twice I kicked his heels clumsily, though he said nothing. A\nminute, and then another, and we reached the confines of the wood coming\nout at last upon the bare rockiness of the countryside. Only then was I\nable to shake off the haunting dread that had followed me among\nthe trees.\n\nOnce, as we moved away, there seemed to come again a distant sound of\nwailing, and I said to myself that it was the wind--yet the evening was\nbreathless.\n\nPresently, Tonnison began to talk.\n\n\"Look you,\" he said with decision, \"I would not spend the night in\n_that_ place for all the wealth that the world holds. There is something\nunholy--diabolical--about it. It came to me all in a moment, just after\nyou spoke. It seemed to me that the woods were full of vile\nthings--you know!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, and looked back toward the place; but it was hidden\nfrom us by a rise in the ground.\n\n\"There's the book,\" I said, and I put my hand into the satchel.\n\n\"You've got it safely?\" he questioned, with a sudden access of anxiety.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he continued, \"we shall learn something from it when we get\nback to the tent. We had better hurry, too; we're a long way off still,\nand I don't fancy, now, being caught out here in the dark.\"\n\nIt was two hours later when we reached the tent; and, without delay, we\nset to work to prepare a meal; for we had eaten nothing since our lunch\nat midday.\n\nSupper over, we cleared the things out of the way, and lit our pipes.\nThen Tonnison asked me to get the manuscript out of my satchel. This I\ndid, and then, as we could not both read from it at the same time, he\nsuggested that I should read the thing out loud. \"And mind,\" he\ncautioned, knowing my propensities, \"don't go skipping half the book.\"\n\nYet, had he but known what it contained, he would have realized how\nneedless such advice was, for once at least. And there seated in the\nopening of our little tent, I began the strange tale of _The House on\nthe Borderland_ (for such was the title of the MS.); this is told in the\nfollowing pages.\n\n\n\n_II_\n\nTHE PLAIN OF SILENCE\n\nI am an old man. I live here in this ancient house, surrounded by huge,\nunkempt gardens.\n\nThe peasantry, who inhabit the wilderness beyond, say that I am mad.\nThat is because I will have nothing to do with them. I live here alone\nwith my old sister, who is also my housekeeper. We keep no servants--I\nhate them. I have one friend, a dog; yes, I would sooner have old Pepper\nthan the rest of Creation together. He, at least, understands me--and\nhas sense enough to leave me alone when I am in my dark moods.\n\nI have decided to start a kind of diary; it may enable me to record\nsome of the thoughts and feelings that I cannot express to anyone; but,\nbeyond this, I am anxious to make some record of the strange things that\nI have heard and seen, during many years of loneliness, in this weird\nold building.\n\nFor a couple of centuries, this house has had a reputation, a bad one,\nand, until I bought it, for more than eighty years no one had lived\nhere; consequently, I got the old place at a ridiculously low figure.\n\nI am not superstitious; but I have ceased to deny that things happen\nin this old house--things that I cannot explain; and, therefore, I must\nneeds ease my mind, by writing down an account of them, to the best of\nmy ability; though, should this, my diary, ever be read when I am gone,\nthe readers will but shake their heads, and be the more convinced that\nI was mad.\n\nThis house, how ancient it is! though its age strikes one less,\nperhaps, than the quaintness of its structure, which is curious and\nfantastic to the last degree. Little curved towers and pinnacles, with\noutlines suggestive of leaping flames, predominate; while the body of\nthe building is in the form of a circle.\n\nI have heard that there is an old story, told amongst the country\npeople, to the effect that the devil built the place. However, that is\nas may be. True or not, I neither know nor care, save as it may have\nhelped to cheapen it, ere I came.\n\nI must have been here some ten years before I saw sufficient to warrant\nany belief in the stories, current in the neighborhood, about this\nhouse. It is true that I had, on at least a dozen occasions, seen,\nvaguely, things that puzzled me, and, perhaps, had felt more than I had\nseen. Then, as the years passed, bringing age upon me, I became often\naware of something unseen, yet unmistakably present, in the empty rooms\nand corridors. Still, it was as I have said many years before I saw any\nreal manifestations of the so-called supernatural.\n\nIt was not Halloween. If I were telling a story for amusement's sake, I\nshould probably place it on that night of nights; but this is a true\nrecord of my own experiences, and I would not put pen to paper to amuse\nanyone. No. It was after midnight on the morning of the twenty-first day\nof January. I was sitting reading, as is often my custom, in my study.\nPepper lay, sleeping, near my chair.\n\nWithout warning, the flames of the two candles went low, and then\nshone with a ghastly green effulgence. I looked up, quickly, and as I\ndid so I saw the lights sink into a dull, ruddy tint; so that the room\nglowed with a strange, heavy, crimson twilight that gave the shadows\nbehind the chairs and tables a double depth of blackness; and wherever\nthe light struck, it was as though luminous blood had been splashed\nover the room.\n\nDown on the floor, I heard a faint, frightened whimper, and something\npressed itself in between my two feet. It was Pepper, cowering under my\ndressing gown. Pepper, usually as brave as a lion!\n\nIt was this movement of the dog's, I think, that gave me the first\ntwinge of _real_ fear. I had been considerably startled when the lights\nburnt first green and then red; but had been momentarily under the\nimpression that the change was due to some influx of noxious gas into\nthe room. Now, however, I saw that it was not so; for the candles burned\nwith a steady flame, and showed no signs of going out, as would have\nbeen the case had the change been due to fumes in the atmosphere.\n\nI did not move. I felt distinctly frightened; but could think of\nnothing better to do than wait. For perhaps a minute, I kept my glance\nabout the room, nervously. Then I noticed that the lights had commenced\nto sink, very slowly; until presently they showed minute specks of red\nfire, like the gleamings of rubies in the darkness. Still, I sat\nwatching; while a sort of dreamy indifference seemed to steal over me;\nbanishing altogether the fear that had begun to grip me.\n\nAway in the far end of the huge old-fashioned room, I became conscious\nof a faint glow. Steadily it grew, filling the room with gleams of\nquivering green light; then they sank quickly, and changed--even as the\ncandle flames had done--into a deep, somber crimson that strengthened,\nand lit up the room with a flood of awful glory.\n\nThe light came from the end wall, and grew ever brighter until its\nintolerable glare caused my eyes acute pain, and involuntarily I closed\nthem. It may have been a few seconds before I was able to open them. The\nfirst thing I noticed was that the light had decreased, greatly; so that\nit no longer tried my eyes. Then, as it grew still duller, I was aware,\nall at once, that, instead of looking at the redness, I was staring\nthrough it, and through the wall beyond.\n\nGradually, as I became more accustomed to the idea, I realized that I\nwas looking out on to a vast plain, lit with the same gloomy twilight\nthat pervaded the room. The immensity of this plain scarcely can be\nconceived. In no part could I perceive its confines. It seemed to\nbroaden and spread out, so that the eye failed to perceive any\nlimitations. Slowly, the details of the nearer portions began to grow\nclear; then, in a moment almost, the light died away, and the vision--if\nvision it were--faded and was gone.\n\nSuddenly, I became conscious that I was no longer in the chair.\nInstead, I seemed to be hovering above it, and looking down at a dim\nsomething, huddled and silent. In a little while, a cold blast struck\nme, and I was outside in the night, floating, like a bubble, up through\nthe darkness. As I moved, an icy coldness seemed to enfold me, so that\nI shivered.\n\nAfter a time, I looked to right and left, and saw the intolerable\nblackness of the night, pierced by remote gleams of fire. Onward,\noutward, I drove. Once, I glanced behind, and saw the earth, a small\ncrescent of blue light, receding away to my left. Further off, the sun,\na splash of white flame, burned vividly against the dark.\n\nAn indefinite period passed. Then, for the last time, I saw the\nearth--an enduring globule of radiant blue, swimming in an eternity of\nether. And there I, a fragile flake of soul dust, flickered silently\nacross the void, from the distant blue, into the expanse of the unknown.\n\nA great while seemed to pass over me, and now I could nowhere see\nanything. I had passed beyond the fixed stars and plunged into the huge\nblackness that waits beyond. All this time I had experienced little,\nsave a sense of lightness and cold discomfort. Now however the atrocious\ndarkness seemed to creep into my soul, and I became filled with fear and\ndespair. What was going to become of me? Where was I going? Even as the\nthoughts were formed, there grew against the impalpable blackness that\nwrapped me a faint tinge of blood. It seemed extraordinarily remote, and\nmistlike; yet, at once, the feeling of oppression was lightened, and I\nno longer despaired.\n\nSlowly, the distant redness became plainer and larger; until, as I drew\nnearer, it spread out into a great, somber glare--dull and tremendous.\nStill, I fled onward, and, presently, I had come so close, that it\nseemed to stretch beneath me, like a great ocean of somber red. I could\nsee little, save that it appeared to spread out interminably in all\ndirections.\n\nIn a further space, I found that I was descending upon it; and, soon, I\nsank into a great sea of sullen, red-hued clouds. Slowly, I emerged from\nthese, and there, below me, I saw the stupendous plain that I had seen\nfrom my room in this house that stands upon the borders of the Silences.\n\nPresently, I landed, and stood, surrounded by a great waste of\nloneliness. The place was lit with a gloomy twilight that gave an\nimpression of indescribable desolation.\n\nAfar to my right, within the sky, there burnt a gigantic ring of\ndull-red fire, from the outer edge of which were projected huge,\nwrithing flames, darted and jagged. The interior of this ring was\nblack, black as the gloom of the outer night. I comprehended, at once,\nthat it was from this extraordinary sun that the place derived its\ndoleful light.\n\nFrom that strange source of light, I glanced down again to my\nsurroundings. Everywhere I looked, I saw nothing but the same flat\nweariness of interminable plain. Nowhere could I descry any signs of\nlife; not even the ruins of some ancient habitation.\n\nGradually, I found that I was being borne forward, floating across the\nflat waste. For what seemed an eternity, I moved onward. I was unaware\nof any great sense of impatience; though some curiosity and a vast\nwonder were with me continually. Always, I saw around me the breadth of\nthat enormous plain; and, always, I searched for some new thing to break\nits monotony; but there was no change--only loneliness, silence,\nand desert.\n\nPresently, in a half-conscious manner, I noticed that there was a faint\nmistiness, ruddy in hue, lying over its surface. Still, when I looked\nmore intently, I was unable to say that it was really mist; for it\nappeared to blend with the plain, giving it a peculiar unrealness, and\nconveying to the senses the idea of unsubstantiality.\n\nGradually, I began to weary with the sameness of the thing. Yet, it was\na great time before I perceived any signs of the place, toward which I\nwas being conveyed.\n\n\"At first, I saw it, far ahead, like a long hillock on the surface of\nthe Plain. Then, as I drew nearer, I perceived that I had been mistaken;\nfor, instead of a low hill, I made out, now, a chain of great mountains,\nwhose distant peaks towered up into the red gloom, until they were\nalmost lost to sight.\"\n\n\n\n_III_\n\nTHE HOUSE IN THE ARENA\n\nAnd so, after a time, I came to the mountains. Then, the course of my\njourney was altered, and I began to move along their bases, until, all\nat once, I saw that I had come opposite to a vast rift, opening into the\nmountains. Through this, I was borne, moving at no great speed. On\neither side of me, huge, scarped walls of rocklike substance rose sheer.\nFar overhead, I discerned a thin ribbon of red, where the mouth of the\nchasm opened, among inaccessible peaks. Within, was gloom, deep and\nsomber, and chilly silence. For a while, I went onward steadily, and\nthen, at last, I saw, ahead, a deep, red glow, that told me I was near\nupon the further opening of the gorge.\n\nA minute came and went, and I was at the exit of the chasm, staring out\nupon an enormous amphitheatre of mountains. Yet, of the mountains, and\nthe terrible grandeur of the place, I recked nothing; for I was\nconfounded with amazement to behold, at a distance of several miles and\noccupying the center of the arena, a stupendous structure built\napparently of green jade. Yet, in itself, it was not the discovery of\nthe building that had so astonished me; but the fact, which became every\nmoment more apparent, that in no particular, save in color and its\nenormous size, did the lonely structure vary from this house in which\nI live.\n\nFor a while, I continued to stare, fixedly. Even then, I could scarcely\nbelieve that I saw aright. In my mind, a question formed, reiterating\nincessantly: 'What does it mean?' 'What does it mean?' and I was unable\nto make answer, even out of the depths of my imagination. I seemed\ncapable only of wonder and fear. For a time longer, I gazed, noting\ncontinually some fresh point of resemblance that attracted me. At last,\nwearied and sorely puzzled, I turned from it, to view the rest of the\nstrange place on to which I had intruded.\n\nHitherto, I had been so engrossed in my scrutiny of the House, that I\nhad given only a cursory glance 'round. Now, as I looked, I began to\nrealize upon what sort of a place I had come. The arena, for so I have\ntermed it, appeared a perfect circle of about ten to twelve miles in\ndiameter, the House, as I have mentioned before, standing in the center.\nThe surface of the place, like to that of the Plain, had a peculiar,\nmisty appearance, that was yet not mist.\n\nFrom a rapid survey, my glance passed quickly upward along the <DW72>s\nof the circling mountains. How silent they were. I think that this same\nabominable stillness was more trying to me than anything that I had so\nfar seen or imagined. I was looking up, now, at the great crags,\ntowering so loftily. Up there, the impalpable redness gave a blurred\nappearance to everything.\n\nAnd then, as I peered, curiously, a new terror came to me; for away up\namong the dim peaks to my right, I had descried a vast shape of\nblackness, giantlike. It grew upon my sight. It had an enormous equine\nhead, with gigantic ears, and seemed to peer steadfastly down into the\narena. There was that about the pose that gave me the impression of an\neternal watchfulness--of having warded that dismal place, through\nunknown eternities. Slowly, the monster became plainer to me; and then,\nsuddenly, my gaze sprang from it to something further off and higher\namong the crags. For a long minute, I gazed, fearfully. I was strangely\nconscious of something not altogether unfamiliar--as though something\nstirred in the back of my mind. The thing was black, and had four\ngrotesque arms. The features showed indistinctly, 'round the neck, I\nmade out several light- objects. Slowly, the details came to me,\nand I realized, coldly, that they were skulls. Further down the body was\nanother circling belt, showing less dark against the black trunk. Then,\neven as I puzzled to know what the thing was, a memory slid into my\nmind, and straightway, I knew that I was looking at a monstrous\nrepresentation of Kali, the Hindu goddess of death.\n\nOther remembrances of my old student days drifted into my thoughts. My\nglance fell back upon the huge beast-headed Thing. Simultaneously, I\nrecognized it for the ancient Egyptian god Set, or Seth, the Destroyer\nof Souls. With the knowledge, there came a great sweep of\nquestioning--'Two of the--!' I stopped, and endeavored to think. Things\nbeyond my imagination peered into my frightened mind. I saw, obscurely.\n'The old gods of mythology!' I tried to comprehend to what it was all\npointing. My gaze dwelt, flickeringly, between the two. 'If--'\n\nAn idea came swiftly, and I turned, and glanced rapidly upward,\nsearching the gloomy crags, away to my left. Something loomed out under\na great peak, a shape of greyness. I wondered I had not seen it earlier,\nand then remembered I had not yet viewed that portion. I saw it more\nplainly now. It was, as I have said, grey. It had a tremendous head; but\nno eyes. That part of its face was blank.\n\nNow, I saw that there were other things up among the mountains. Further\noff, reclining on a lofty ledge, I made out a livid mass, irregular and\nghoulish. It seemed without form, save for an unclean, half-animal face,\nthat looked out, vilely, from somewhere about its middle. And then I saw\nothers--there were hundreds of them. They seemed to grow out of the\nshadows. Several I recognized almost immediately as mythological\ndeities; others were strange to me, utterly strange, beyond the power of\na human mind to conceive.\n\nOn each side, I looked, and saw more, continually. The mountains were\nfull of strange things--Beast-gods, and Horrors so atrocious and bestial\nthat possibility and decency deny any further attempt to describe them.\nAnd I--I was filled with a terrible sense of overwhelming horror and\nfear and repugnance; yet, spite of these, I wondered exceedingly. Was\nthere then, after all, something in the old heathen worship, something\nmore than the mere deifying of men, animals, and elements? The thought\ngripped me--was there?\n\nLater, a question repeated itself. What were they, those Beast-gods,\nand the others? At first, they had appeared to me just sculptured\nMonsters placed indiscriminately among the inaccessible peaks and\nprecipices of the surrounding mountains. Now, as I scrutinized them with\ngreater intentness, my mind began to reach out to fresh conclusions.\nThere was something about them, an indescribable sort of silent vitality\nthat suggested, to my broadening consciousness, a state of\nlife-in-death--a something that was by no means life, as we understand\nit; but rather an inhuman form of existence, that well might be likened\nto a deathless trance--a condition in which it was possible to imagine\ntheir continuing, eternally. 'Immortal!' the word rose in my thoughts\nunbidden; and, straightway, I grew to wondering whether this might be\nthe immortality of the gods.\n\nAnd then, in the midst of my wondering and musing, something happened.\nUntil then, I had been staying just within the shadow of the exit of the\ngreat rift. Now, without volition on my part, I drifted out of the\nsemi-darkness and began to move slowly across the arena--toward the\nHouse. At this, I gave up all thoughts of those prodigious Shapes above\nme--and could only stare, frightenedly, at the tremendous structure\ntoward which I was being conveyed so remorselessly. Yet, though I\nsearched earnestly, I could discover nothing that I had not already\nseen, and so became gradually calmer.\n\nPresently, I had reached a point more than halfway between the House\nand the gorge. All around was spread the stark loneliness of the place,\nand the unbroken silence. Steadily, I neared the great building. Then,\nall at once, something caught my vision, something that came 'round one\nof the huge buttresses of the House, and so into full view. It was a\ngigantic thing, and moved with a curious lope, going almost upright,\nafter the manner of a man. It was quite unclothed, and had a remarkable\nluminous appearance. Yet it was the face that attracted and frightened\nme the most. It was the face of a swine.\n\nSilently, intently, I watched this horrible creature, and forgot my\nfear, momentarily, in my interest in its movements. It was making its\nway, cumbrously 'round the building, stopping as it came to each window\nto peer in and shake at the bars, with which--as in this house--they\nwere protected; and whenever it came to a door, it would push at it,\nfingering the fastening stealthily. Evidently, it was searching for an\ningress into the House.\n\nI had come now to within less than a quarter of a mile of the great\nstructure, and still I was compelled forward. Abruptly, the Thing turned\nand gazed hideously in my direction. It opened its mouth, and, for the\nfirst time, the stillness of that abominable place was broken, by a\ndeep, booming note that sent an added thrill of apprehension through me.\nThen, immediately, I became aware that it was coming toward me, swiftly\nand silently. In an instant, it had covered half the distance that lay\nbetween. And still, I was borne helplessly to meet it. Only a hundred\nyards, and the brutish ferocity of the giant face numbed me with a\nfeeling of unmitigated horror. I could have screamed, in the supremeness\nof my fear; and then, in the very moment of my extremity and despair, I\nbecame conscious that I was looking down upon the arena, from a rapidly\nincreasing height. I was rising, rising. In an inconceivably short\nwhile, I had reached an altitude of many hundred feet. Beneath me, the\nspot that I had just left, was occupied by the foul Swine-creature. It\nhad gone down on all fours and was snuffing and rooting, like a\nveritable hog, at the surface of the arena. A moment and it rose to its\nfeet, clutching upward, with an expression of desire upon its face such\nas I have never seen in this world.\n\nContinually, I mounted higher. A few minutes, it seemed, and I had\nrisen above the great mountains--floating, alone, afar in the redness.\nAt a tremendous distance below, the arena showed, dimly; with the mighty\nHouse looking no larger than a tiny spot of green. The Swine-thing was\nno longer visible.\n\nPresently, I passed over the mountains, out above the huge breadth of\nthe plain. Far away, on its surface, in the direction of the ring-shaped\nsun, there showed a confused blur. I looked toward it, indifferently. It\nreminded me, somewhat, of the first glimpse I had caught of the\nmountain-amphitheatre.\n\nWith a sense of weariness, I glanced upward at the immense ring of\nfire. What a strange thing it was! Then, as I stared, out from the dark\ncenter, there spurted a sudden flare of extraordinary vivid fire.\nCompared with the size of the black center, it was as naught; yet, in\nitself, stupendous. With awakened interest, I watched it carefully,\nnoting its strange boiling and glowing. Then, in a moment, the whole\nthing grew dim and unreal, and so passed out of sight. Much amazed, I\nglanced down to the Plain from which I was still rising. Thus, I\nreceived a fresh surprise. The Plain--everything had vanished, and only\na sea of red mist was spread far below me. Gradually as I stared this\ngrew remote, and died away into a dim far mystery of red against an\nunfathomable night. A while, and even this had gone, and I was wrapped\nin an impalpable, lightless gloom.\n\n\n\n_IV_\n\nTHE EARTH\n\nThus I was, and only the memory that I had lived through the dark, once\nbefore, served to sustain my thoughts. A great time passed--ages. And\nthen a single star broke its way through the darkness. It was the first\nof one of the outlying clusters of this universe. Presently, it was far\nbehind, and all about me shone the splendor of the countless stars.\nLater, years it seemed, I saw the sun, a clot of flame. Around it, I\nmade out presently several remote specks of light--the planets of the\nSolar system. And so I saw the earth again, blue and unbelievably\nminute. It grew larger, and became defined.\n\nA long space of time came and went, and then at last I entered into the\nshadow of the world--plunging headlong into the dim and holy earth\nnight. Overhead were the old constellations, and there was a crescent\nmoon. Then, as I neared the earth's surface, a dimness swept over me,\nand I appeared to sink into a black mist.\n\nFor a while, I knew nothing. I was unconscious. Gradually, I became\naware of a faint, distant whining. It became plainer. A desperate\nfeeling of agony possessed me. I struggled madly for breath, and tried\nto shout. A moment, and I got my breath more easily. I was conscious\nthat something was licking my hand. Something damp swept across my face.\nI heard a panting, and then again the whining. It seemed to come to my\nears, now, with a sense of familiarity, and I opened my eyes. All was\ndark; but the feeling of oppression had left me. I was seated, and\nsomething was whining piteously, and licking me. I felt strangely\nconfused, and, instinctively, tried to ward off the thing that licked.\nMy head was curiously vacant, and, for the moment, I seemed incapable of\naction or thought. Then, things came back to me, and I called 'Pepper,'\nfaintly. I was answered by a joyful bark, and renewed and\nfrantic caresses.\n\nIn a little while, I felt stronger, and put out my hand for the\nmatches. I groped about, for a few moments, blindly; then my hands lit\nupon them, and I struck a light, and looked confusedly around. All about\nme, I saw the old, familiar things. And there I sat, full of dazed\nwonders, until the flame of the match burnt my finger, and I dropped it;\nwhile a hasty expression of pain and anger, escaped my lips, surprising\nme with the sound of my own voice.\n\nAfter a moment, I struck another match, and, stumbling across the room,\nlit the candles. As I did so, I observed that they had not burned away,\nbut had been put out.\n\nAs the flames shot up, I turned, and stared about the study; yet there\nwas nothing unusual to see; and, suddenly, a gust of irritation took me.\nWhat had happened? I held my head, with both hands, and tried to\nremember. Ah! the great, silent Plain, and the ring-shaped sun of red\nfire. Where were they? Where had I seen them? How long ago? I felt dazed\nand muddled. Once or twice, I walked up and down the room, unsteadily.\nMy memory seemed dulled, and, already, the thing I had witnessed came\nback to me with an effort.\n\nI have a remembrance of cursing, peevishly, in my bewilderment.\nSuddenly, I turned faint and giddy, and had to grasp at the table for\nsupport. During a few moments, I held on, weakly; and then managed to\ntotter sideways into a chair. After a little time, I felt somewhat\nbetter, and succeeded in reaching the cupboard where, usually, I keep\nbrandy and biscuits. I poured myself out a little of the stimulant, and\ndrank it off. Then, taking a handful of biscuits, I returned to my\nchair, and began to devour them, ravenously. I was vaguely surprised at\nmy hunger. I felt as though I had eaten nothing for an uncountably\nlong while.\n\nAs I ate, my glance roved about the room, taking in its various\ndetails, and still searching, though almost unconsciously, for something\ntangible upon which to take hold, among the invisible mysteries that\nencompassed me. 'Surely,' I thought, 'there must be something--' And, in\nthe same instant, my gaze dwelt upon the face of the clock in the\nopposite corner. Therewith, I stopped eating, and just stared. For,\nthough its ticking indicated most certainly that it was still going, the\nhands were pointing to a little _before_ the hour of midnight; whereas\nit was, as well I knew, considerably _after_ that time when I had\nwitnessed the first of the strange happenings I have just described.\n\nFor perhaps a moment I was astounded and puzzled. Had the hour been the\nsame as when I had last seen the clock, I should have concluded that the\nhands had stuck in one place, while the internal mechanism went on as\nusual; but that would, in no way, account for the hands having traveled\nbackward. Then, even as I turned the matter over in my wearied brain,\nthe thought flashed upon me that it was now close upon the morning of\nthe twenty-second, and that I had been unconscious to the visible world\nthrough the greater portion of the last twenty-four hours. The thought\noccupied my attention for a full minute; then I commenced to eat again.\nI was still very hungry.\n\nDuring breakfast, next morning, I inquired casually of my sister\nregarding the date, and found my surmise correct. I had, indeed, been\nabsent--at least in spirit--for nearly a day and a night.\n\nMy sister asked me no questions; for it is not by any means the first\ntime that I have kept to my study for a whole day, and sometimes a\ncouple of days at a time, when I have been particularly engrossed in my\nbooks or work.\n\nAnd so the days pass on, and I am still filled with a wonder to know\nthe meaning of all that I saw on that memorable night. Yet, well I know\nthat my curiosity is little likely to be satisfied.\n\n\n\n_V_\n\nTHE THING IN THE PIT\n\nThis house is, as I have said before, surrounded by a huge estate, and\nwild and uncultivated gardens.\n\nAway at the back, distant some three hundred yards, is a dark, deep\nravine--spoken of as the 'Pit,' by the peasantry. At the bottom runs a\nsluggish stream so overhung by trees as scarcely to be seen from above.\n\nIn passing, I must explain that this river has a subterranean origin,\nemerging suddenly at the East end of the ravine, and disappearing, as\nabruptly, beneath the cliffs that form its Western extremity.\n\nIt was some months after my vision (if vision it were) of the great\nPlain that my attention was particularly attracted to the Pit.\n\nI happened, one day, to be walking along its Southern edge, when,\nsuddenly, several pieces of rock and shale were dislodged from the face\nof the cliff immediately beneath me, and fell with a sullen crash\nthrough the trees. I heard them splash in the river at the bottom; and\nthen silence. I should not have given this incident more than a passing\nthought, had not Pepper at once begun to bark savagely; nor would he be\nsilent when I bade him, which is most unusual behavior on his part.\n\nFeeling that there must be someone or something in the Pit, I went back\nto the house, quickly, for a stick. When I returned, Pepper had ceased\nhis barks and was growling and smelling, uneasily, along the top.\n\nWhistling to him to follow me, I started to descend cautiously. The\ndepth to the bottom of the Pit must be about a hundred and fifty feet,\nand some time as well as considerable care was expended before we\nreached the bottom in safety.\n\nOnce down, Pepper and I started to explore along the banks of the\nriver. It was very dark there due to the overhanging trees, and I moved\nwarily, keeping my glance about me and my stick ready.\n\nPepper was quiet now and kept close to me all the time. Thus, we\nsearched right up one side of the river, without hearing or seeing\nanything. Then, we crossed over--by the simple method of jumping--and\ncommenced to beat our way back through the underbrush.\n\nWe had accomplished perhaps half the distance, when I heard again the\nsound of falling stones on the other side--the side from which we had\njust come. One large rock came thundering down through the treetops,\nstruck the opposite bank, and bounded into the river, driving a great\njet of water right over us. At this, Pepper gave out a deep growl; then\nstopped, and pricked up his ears. I listened, also.\n\nA second later, a loud, half-human, half-piglike squeal sounded from\namong the trees, apparently about halfway up the South cliff. It was\nanswered by a similar note from the bottom of the Pit. At this, Pepper\ngave a short, sharp bark, and, springing across the little river,\ndisappeared into the bushes.\n\nImmediately afterward, I heard his barks increase in depth and number,\nand in between there sounded a noise of confused jabbering. This ceased,\nand, in the succeeding silence, there rose a semi-human yell of agony.\nAlmost immediately, Pepper gave a long-drawn howl of pain, and then the\nshrubs were violently agitated, and he came running out with his tail\ndown, and glancing as he ran over his shoulder. As he reached me, I saw\nthat he was bleeding from what appeared to be a great claw wound in the\nside that had almost laid bare his ribs.\n\nSeeing Pepper thus mutilated, a furious feeling of anger seized me,\nand, whirling my staff, I sprang across, and into the bushes from which\nPepper had emerged. As I forced my way through, I thought I heard a\nsound of breathing. Next instant, I had burst into a little clear space,\njust in time to see something, livid white in color, disappear among the\nbushes on the opposite side. With a shout, I ran toward it; but, though\nI struck and probed among the bushes with my stick, I neither saw nor\nheard anything further; and so returned to Pepper. There, after bathing\nhis wound in the river, I bound my wetted handkerchief 'round his body;\nhaving done which, we retreated up the ravine and into the\ndaylight again.\n\nOn reaching the house, my sister inquired what had happened to Pepper,\nand I told her he had been fighting with a wildcat, of which I had heard\nthere were several about.\n\nI felt it would be better not to tell her how it had really happened;\nthough, to be sure, I scarcely knew myself; but this I did know, that\nthe thing I had seen run into the bushes was no wildcat. It was much too\nbig, and had, so far as I had observed, a skin like a hog's, only of a\ndead, unhealthy white color. And then--it had run upright, or nearly so,\nupon its hind feet, with a motion somewhat resembling that of a human\nbeing. This much I had noticed in my brief glimpse, and, truth to tell,\nI felt a good deal of uneasiness, besides curiosity as I turned the\nmatter over in my mind.\n\nIt was in the morning that the above incident had occurred.\n\nThen, it would be after dinner, as I sat reading, that, happening to\nlook up suddenly, I saw something peering in over the window ledge the\neyes and ears alone showing.\n\n'A pig, by Jove!' I said, and rose to my feet. Thus, I saw the thing\nmore completely; but it was no pig--God alone knows what it was. It\nreminded me, vaguely, of the hideous Thing that had haunted the great\narena. It had a grotesquely human mouth and jaw; but with no chin of\nwhich to speak. The nose was prolonged into a snout; thus it was that\nwith the little eyes and queer ears, gave it such an extraordinarily\nswinelike appearance. Of forehead there was little, and the whole face\nwas of an unwholesome white color.\n\nFor perhaps a minute, I stood looking at the thing with an ever growing\nfeeling of disgust, and some fear. The mouth kept jabbering, inanely,\nand once emitted a half-swinish grunt. I think it was the eyes that\nattracted me the most; they seemed to glow, at times, with a horribly\nhuman intelligence, and kept flickering away from my face, over the\ndetails of the room, as though my stare disturbed it.\n\nIt appeared to be supporting itself by two clawlike hands upon the\nwindowsill. These claws, unlike the face, were of a clayey brown hue,\nand bore an indistinct resemblance to human hands, in that they had four\nfingers and a thumb; though these were webbed up to the first joint,\nmuch as are a duck's. Nails it had also, but so long and powerful that\nthey were more like the talons of an eagle than aught else.\n\nAs I have said, before, I felt some fear; though almost of an\nimpersonal kind. I may explain my feeling better by saying that it was\nmore a sensation of abhorrence; such as one might expect to feel, if\nbrought in contact with something superhumanly foul; something\nunholy--belonging to some hitherto undreamt of state of existence.\n\nI cannot say that I grasped these various details of the brute at the\ntime. I think they seemed to come back to me, afterward, as though\nimprinted upon my brain. I imagined more than I saw as I looked at the\nthing, and the material details grew upon me later.\n\nFor perhaps a minute I stared at the creature; then as my nerves\nsteadied a little I shook off the vague alarm that held me, and took a\nstep toward the window. Even as I did so, the thing ducked and vanished.\nI rushed to the door and looked 'round hurriedly; but only the tangled\nbushes and shrubs met my gaze.\n\nI ran back into the house, and, getting my gun, sallied out to search\nthrough the gardens. As I went, I asked myself whether the thing I had\njust seen was likely to be the same of which I had caught a glimpse in\nthe morning. I inclined to think it was.\n\nI would have taken Pepper with me; but judged it better to give his\nwound a chance to heal. Besides, if the creature I had just seen was, as\nI imagined, his antagonist of the morning, it was not likely that he\nwould be of much use.\n\nI began my search, systematically. I was determined, if it were\npossible, to find and put an end to that swine-thing. This was, at\nleast, a material Horror!\n\nAt first, I searched, cautiously; with the thought of Pepper's wound in\nmy mind; but, as the hours passed, and not a sign of anything living,\nshowed in the great, lonely gardens, I became less apprehensive. I felt\nalmost as though I would welcome the sight of it. Anything seemed better\nthan this silence, with the ever-present feeling that the creature might\nbe lurking in every bush I passed. Later, I grew careless of danger, to\nthe extent of plunging right through the bushes, probing with my gun\nbarrel as I went.\n\nAt times, I shouted; but only the echoes answered back. I thought thus\nperhaps to frighten or stir the creature to showing itself; but only\nsucceeded in bringing my sister Mary out, to know what was the matter. I\ntold her, that I had seen the wildcat that had wounded Pepper, and that\nI was trying to hunt it out of the bushes. She seemed only half\nsatisfied, and went back into the house, with an expression of doubt\nupon her face. I wondered whether she had seen or guessed anything. For\nthe rest of the afternoon, I prosecuted the search anxiously. I felt\nthat I should be unable to sleep, with that bestial thing haunting the\nshrubberies, and yet, when evening fell, I had seen nothing. Then, as I\nturned homeward, I heard a short, unintelligible noise, among the bushes\nto my right. Instantly, I turned, and, aiming quickly, fired in the\ndirection of the sound. Immediately afterward, I heard something\nscuttling away among the bushes. It moved rapidly, and in a minute had\ngone out of hearing. After a few steps I ceased my pursuit, realizing\nhow futile it must be in the fast gathering gloom; and so, with a\ncurious feeling of depression, I entered the house.\n\nThat night, after my sister had gone to bed, I went 'round to all the\nwindows and doors on the ground floor; and saw to it that they were\nsecurely fastened. This precaution was scarcely necessary as regards the\nwindows, as all of those on the lower storey are strongly barred; but\nwith the doors--of which there are five--it was wisely thought, as not\none was locked.\n\nHaving secured these, I went to my study, yet, somehow, for once, the\nplace jarred upon me; it seemed so huge and echoey. For some time I\ntried to read; but at last finding it impossible I carried my book down\nto the kitchen where a large fire was burning, and sat there.\n\nI dare say, I had read for a couple of hours, when, suddenly, I heard a\nsound that made me lower my book, and listen, intently. It was a noise\nof something rubbing and fumbling against the back door. Once the door\ncreaked, loudly; as though force were being applied to it. During those\nfew, short moments, I experienced an indescribable feeling of terror,\nsuch as I should have believed impossible. My hands shook; a cold sweat\nbroke out on me, and I shivered violently.\n\nGradually, I calmed. The stealthy movements outside had ceased.\n\nThen for an hour I sat silent and watchful. All at once the feeling of\nfear took me again. I felt as I imagine an animal must, under the eye of\na snake. Yet now I could hear nothing. Still, there was no doubting that\nsome unexplained influence was at work.\n\nGradually, imperceptibly almost, something stole on my ear--a sound\nthat resolved itself into a faint murmur. Quickly it developed and grew\ninto a muffled but hideous chorus of bestial shrieks. It appeared to\nrise from the bowels of the earth.\n\nI heard a thud, and realized in a dull, half comprehending way that I\nhad dropped my book. After that, I just sat; and thus the daylight found\nme, when it crept wanly in through the barred, high windows of the\ngreat kitchen.\n\nWith the dawning light, the feeling of stupor and fear left me; and I\ncame more into possession of my senses.\n\nThereupon I picked up my book, and crept to the door to listen. Not a\nsound broke the chilly silence. For some minutes I stood there; then,\nvery gradually and cautiously, I drew back the bolt and opening the door\npeeped out.\n\nMy caution was unneeded. Nothing was to be seen, save the grey vista of\ndreary, tangled bushes and trees, extending to the distant plantation.\n\nWith a shiver, I closed the door, and made my way, quietly, up to bed.\n\n\n\n_VI_\n\nTHE SWINE-THINGS\n\nIt was evening, a week later. My sister sat in the garden, knitting. I\nwas walking up and down, reading. My gun leant up against the wall of\nthe house; for, since the advent of that strange thing in the gardens, I\nhad deemed it wise to take precautions. Yet, through the whole week,\nthere had been nothing to alarm me, either by sight or sound; so that I\nwas able to look back, calmly, to the incident; though still with a\nsense of unmitigated wonder and curiosity.\n\nI was, as I have just said, walking up and down, and somewhat engrossed\nin my book. Suddenly, I heard a crash, away in the direction of the Pit.\nWith a quick movement, I turned and saw a tremendous column of dust\nrising high into the evening air.\n\nMy sister had risen to her feet, with a sharp exclamation of surprise\nand fright.\n\nTelling her to stay where she was, I snatched up my gun, and ran toward\nthe Pit. As I neared it, I heard a dull, rumbling sound, that grew\nquickly into a roar, split with deeper crashes, and up from the Pit\ndrove a fresh volume of dust.\n\nThe noise ceased, though the dust still rose, tumultuously.\n\nI reached the edge, and looked down; but could see nothing save a boil\nof dust clouds swirling hither and thither. The air was so full of the\nsmall particles, that they blinded and choked me; and, finally, I had to\nrun out from the smother, to breathe.\n\nGradually, the suspended matter sank, and hung in a panoply over the\nmouth of the Pit.\n\nI could only guess at what had happened.\n\nThat there had been a land-slip of some kind, I had little doubt; but\nthe cause was beyond my knowledge; and yet, even then, I had half\nimaginings; for, already, the thought had come to me, of those falling\nrocks, and that Thing in the bottom of the Pit; but, in the first\nminutes of confusion, I failed to reach the natural conclusion, to which\nthe catastrophe pointed.\n\nSlowly, the dust subsided, until, presently, I was able to approach the\nedge, and look down.\n\nFor a while, I peered impotently, trying to see through the reek. At\nfirst, it was impossible to make out anything. Then, as I stared, I saw\nsomething below, to my left, that moved. I looked intently toward it,\nand, presently, made out another, and then another--three dim shapes\nthat appeared to be climbing up the side of the Pit. I could see them\nonly indistinctly. Even as I stared and wondered, I heard a rattle of\nstones, somewhere to my right. I glanced across; but could see nothing.\nI leant forward, and peered over, and down into the Pit, just beneath\nwhere I stood; and saw no further than a hideous, white swine-face, that\nhad risen to within a couple of yards of my feet. Below it, I could make\nout several others. As the Thing saw me, it gave a sudden, uncouth\nsqueal, which was answered from all parts of the Pit. At that, a gust of\nhorror and fear took me, and, bending down, I discharged my gun right\ninto its face. Straightway, the creature disappeared, with a clatter of\nloose earth and stones.\n\nThere was a momentary silence, to which, probably, I owe my life; for,\nduring it, I heard a quick patter of many feet, and, turning sharply,\nsaw a troop of the creatures coming toward me, at a run. Instantly, I\nraised my gun and fired at the foremost, who plunged head-long, with a\nhideous howling. Then, I turned to run. More than halfway from the house\nto the Pit, I saw my sister--she was coming toward me. I could not see\nher face, distinctly, as the dusk had fallen; but there was fear in her\nvoice as she called to know why I was shooting.\n\n'Run!' I shouted in reply. 'Run for your life!'\n\nWithout more ado, she turned and fled--picking up her skirts with both\nhands. As I followed, I gave a glance behind. The brutes were running on\ntheir hind legs--at times dropping on all fours.\n\nI think it must have been the terror in my voice, that spurred Mary to\nrun so; for I feel convinced that she had not, as yet, seen those hell\ncreatures that pursued.\n\nOn we went, my sister leading.\n\nEach moment, the nearing sounds of the footsteps, told me that the\nbrutes were gaining on us, rapidly. Fortunately, I am accustomed to\nlive, in some ways, an active life. As it was, the strain of the race\nwas beginning to tell severely upon me.\n\nAhead, I could see the back door--luckily it was open. I was some\nhalf-dozen yards behind Mary, now, and my breath was sobbing in my\nthroat. Then, something touched my shoulder. I wrenched my head 'round,\nquickly, and saw one of those monstrous, pallid faces close to mine. One\nof the creatures, having outrun its companions, had almost overtaken me.\nEven as I turned, it made a fresh grab. With a sudden effort, I sprang\nto one side, and, swinging my gun by the barrel, brought it crashing\ndown upon the foul creature's head. The Thing dropped, with an almost\nhuman groan.\n\nEven this short delay had been nearly sufficient to bring the rest of\nthe brutes down upon me; so that, without an instant's waste of time, I\nturned and ran for the door.\n\nReaching it, I burst into the passage; then, turning quickly, slammed\nand bolted the door, just as the first of the creatures rushed against\nit, with a sudden shock.\n\nMy sister sat, gasping, in a chair. She seemed in a fainting condition;\nbut I had no time then to spend on her. I had to make sure that all the\ndoors were fastened. Fortunately, they were. The one leading from my\nstudy into the gardens, was the last to which I went. I had just had\ntime to note that it was secured, when I thought I heard a noise\noutside. I stood perfectly silent, and listened. Yes! Now I could\ndistinctly hear a sound of whispering, and something slithered over the\npanels, with a rasping, scratchy noise. Evidently, some of the brutes\nwere feeling with their claw-hands, about the door, to discover whether\nthere were any means of ingress.\n\nThat the creatures should so soon have found the door was--to me--a\nproof of their reasoning capabilities. It assured me that they must not\nbe regarded, by any means, as mere animals. I had felt something of this\nbefore, when that first Thing peered in through my window. Then I had\napplied the term superhuman to it, with an almost instinctive knowledge\nthat the creature was something different from the brute-beast.\nSomething beyond human; yet in no good sense; but rather as something\nfoul and hostile to the _great_ and _good_ in humanity. In a word, as\nsomething intelligent, and yet inhuman. The very thought of the\ncreatures filled me with revulsion.\n\nNow, I bethought me of my sister, and, going to the cupboard, I got\nout a flask of brandy, and a wine-glass. Taking these, I went down to\nthe kitchen, carrying a lighted candle with me. She was not sitting in\nthe chair, but had fallen out, and was lying upon the floor,\nface downward.\n\nVery gently, I turned her over, and raised her head somewhat. Then, I\npoured a little of the brandy between her lips. After a while, she\nshivered slightly. A little later, she gave several gasps, and opened\nher eyes. In a dreamy, unrealizing way, she looked at me. Then her eyes\nclosed, slowly, and I gave her a little more of the brandy. For, perhaps\na minute longer, she lay silent, breathing quickly. All at once, her\neyes opened again, and it seemed to me, as I looked, that the pupils\nwere dilated, as though fear had come with returning consciousness.\nThen, with a movement so unexpected that I started backward, she sat up.\nNoticing that she seemed giddy, I put out my hand to steady her. At\nthat, she gave a loud scream, and, scrambling to her feet, ran from\nthe room.\n\nFor a moment, I stayed there--kneeling and holding the brandy flask. I\nwas utterly puzzled and astonished.\n\nCould she be afraid of me? But no! Why should she? I could only\nconclude that her nerves were badly shaken, and that she was temporarily\nunhinged. Upstairs, I heard a door bang, loudly, and I knew that she had\ntaken refuge in her room. I put the flask down on the table. My\nattention was distracted by a noise in the direction of the back door. I\nwent toward it, and listened. It appeared to be shaken, as though some\nof the creatures struggled with it, silently; but it was far too\nstrongly constructed and hung to be easily moved.\n\nOut in the gardens rose a continuous sound. It might have been\nmistaken, by a casual listener, for the grunting and squealing of a herd\nof pigs. But, as I stood there, it came to me that there was sense and\nmeaning to all those swinish noises. Gradually, I seemed able to trace\na semblance in it to human speech--glutinous and sticky, as though each\narticulation were made with difficulty: yet, nevertheless, I was\nbecoming convinced that it was no mere medley of sounds; but a rapid\ninterchange of ideas.\n\nBy this time, it had grown quite dark in the passages, and from these\ncame all the varied cries and groans of which an old house is so full\nafter nightfall. It is, no doubt, because things are then quieter, and\none has more leisure to hear. Also, there may be something in the theory\nthat the sudden change of temperature, at sundown, affects the structure\nof the house, somewhat--causing it to contract and settle, as it were,\nfor the night. However, this is as may be; but, on that night in\nparticular, I would gladly have been quit of so many eerie noises. It\nseemed to me, that each crack and creak was the coming of one of those\nThings along the dark corridors; though I knew in my heart that this\ncould not be, for I had seen, myself, that all the doors were secure.\n\nGradually, however, these sounds grew on my nerves to such an extent\nthat, were it only to punish my cowardice, I felt I must make the 'round\nof the basement again, and, if anything were there, face it. And then, I\nwould go up to my study, for I knew sleep was out of the question, with\nthe house surrounded by creatures, half beasts, half something else, and\nentirely unholy.\n\nTaking the kitchen lamp down from its hook, I made my way from cellar\nto cellar, and room to room; through pantry and coal-hole--along\npassages, and into the hundred-and-one little blind alleys and hidden\nnooks that form the basement of the old house. Then, when I knew I had\nbeen in every corner and cranny large enough to conceal aught of any\nsize, I made my way to the stairs.\n\nWith my foot on the first step, I paused. It seemed to me, I heard a\nmovement, apparently from the buttery, which is to the left of the\nstaircase. It had been one of the first places I searched, and yet, I\nfelt certain my ears had not deceived me. My nerves were strung now,\nand, with hardly any hesitation, I stepped up to the door, holding the\nlamp above my head. In a glance, I saw that the place was empty, save\nfor the heavy, stone slabs, supported by brick pillars; and I was about\nto leave it, convinced that I had been mistaken; when, in turning, my\nlight was flashed back from two bright spots outside the window, and\nhigh up. For a few moments, I stood there, staring. Then they\nmoved--revolving slowly, and throwing out alternate scintillations of\ngreen and red; at least, so it appeared to me. I knew then that they\nwere eyes.\n\nSlowly, I traced the shadowy outline of one of the Things. It appeared\nto be holding on to the bars of the window, and its attitude suggested\nclimbing. I went nearer to the window, and held the light higher. There\nwas no need to be afraid of the creature; the bars were strong, and\nthere was little danger of its being able to move them. And then,\nsuddenly, in spite of the knowledge that the brute could not reach to\nharm me, I had a return of the horrible sensation of fear, that had\nassailed me on that night, a week previously. It was the same feeling of\nhelpless, shuddering fright. I realized, dimly, that the creature's eyes\nwere looking into mine with a steady, compelling stare. I tried to turn\naway; but could not. I seemed, now, to see the window through a mist.\nThen, I thought other eyes came and peered, and yet others; until a\nwhole galaxy of malignant, staring orbs seemed to hold me in thrall.\n\nMy head began to swim, and throb violently. Then, I was aware of a\nfeeling of acute physical pain in my left hand. It grew more severe, and\nforced, literally forced, my attention. With a tremendous effort, I\nglanced down; and, with that, the spell that had held me was broken. I\nrealized, then, that I had, in my agitation, unconsciously caught hold\nof the hot lamp-glass, and burnt my hand, badly. I looked up to the\nwindow, again. The misty appearance had gone, and, now, I saw that it\nwas crowded with dozens of bestial faces. With a sudden access of rage,\nI raised the lamp, and hurled it, full at the window. It struck the\nglass (smashing a pane), and passed between two of the bars, out into\nthe garden, scattering burning oil as it went. I heard several loud\ncries of pain, and, as my sight became accustomed to the dark, I\ndiscovered that the creatures had left the window.\n\nPulling myself together, I groped for the door, and, having found it,\nmade my way upstairs, stumbling at each step. I felt dazed, as though I\nhad received a blow on the head. At the same time, my hand smarted\nbadly, and I was full of a nervous, dull rage against those Things.\n\nReaching my study, I lit the candles. As they burnt up, their rays were\nreflected from the rack of firearms on the sidewall. At the sight, I\nremembered that I had there a power, which, as I had proved earlier,\nseemed as fatal to those monsters as to more ordinary animals; and I\ndetermined I would take the offensive.\n\nFirst of all, I bound up my hand; for the pain was fast becoming\nintolerable. After that, it seemed easier, and I crossed the room, to\nthe rifle stand. There, I selected a heavy rifle--an old and tried\nweapon; and, having procured ammunition, I made my way up into one of\nthe small towers, with which the house is crowned.\n\nFrom there, I found that I could see nothing. The gardens presented a\ndim blur of shadows--a little blacker, perhaps, where the trees stood.\nThat was all, and I knew that it was useless to shoot down into all that\ndarkness. The only thing to be done, was to wait for the moon to rise;\nthen, I might be able to do a little execution.\n\nIn the meantime, I sat still, and kept my ears open. The gardens were\ncomparatively quiet now, and only an occasional grunt or squeal came up\nto me. I did not like this silence; it made me wonder on what devilry\nthe creatures were bent. Twice, I left the tower, and took a walk\nthrough the house; but everything was silent.\n\nOnce, I heard a noise, from the direction of the Pit, as though more\nearth had fallen. Following this, and lasting for some fifteen minutes,\nthere was a commotion among the denizens of the gardens. This died away,\nand, after that all was again quiet.\n\nAbout an hour later, the moon's light showed above the distant horizon.\nFrom where I sat, I could see it over the trees; but it was not until it\nrose clear of them, that I could make out any of the details in the\ngardens below. Even then, I could see none of the brutes; until,\nhappening to crane forward, I saw several of them lying prone, up\nagainst the wall of the house. What they were doing, I could not make\nout. It was, however, a chance too good to be ignored; and, taking aim,\nI fired at the one directly beneath. There was a shrill scream, and, as\nthe smoke cleared away, I saw that it had turned on its back, and was\nwrithing, feebly. Then, it was quiet. The others had disappeared.\n\nImmediately after this, I heard a loud squeal, in the direction of the\nPit. It was answered, a hundred times, from every part of the garden.\nThis gave me some notion of the number of the creatures, and I began to\nfeel that the whole affair was becoming even more serious than I\nhad imagined.\n\nAs I sat there, silent and watchful, the thought came to me--Why was\nall this? What were these Things? What did it mean? Then my thoughts\nflew back to that vision (though, even now, I doubt whether it was a\nvision) of the Plain of Silence. What did that mean? I wondered--And\nthat Thing in the arena? Ugh! Lastly, I thought of the house I had seen\nin that far-away place. That house, so like this in every detail of\nexternal structure, that it might have been modeled from it; or this\nfrom that. I had never thought of that--\n\nAt this moment, there came another long squeal, from the Pit, followed,\na second later, by a couple of shorter ones. At once, the garden was\nfilled with answering cries. I stood up, quickly, and looked over the\nparapet. In the moonlight, it seemed as though the shrubberies were\nalive. They tossed hither and thither, as though shaken by a strong,\nirregular wind; while a continuous rustling, and a noise of scampering\nfeet, rose up to me. Several times, I saw the moonlight gleam on\nrunning, white figures among the bushes, and, twice, I fired. The second\ntime, my shot was answered by a short squeal of pain.\n\nA minute later, the gardens lay silent. From the Pit, came a deep,\nhoarse Babel of swine-talk. At times, angry cries smote the air, and\nthey would be answered by multitudinous gruntings. It occurred to me,\nthat they were holding some kind of a council, perhaps to discuss the\nproblem of entering the house. Also, I thought that they seemed much\nenraged, probably by my successful shots.\n\nIt occurred to me, that now would be a good time to make a final survey\nof our defenses. This, I proceeded to do at once; visiting the whole of\nthe basement again, and examining each of the doors. Luckily, they are\nall, like the back one, built of solid, iron-studded oak. Then, I went\nupstairs to the study. I was more anxious about this door. It is,\npalpably, of a more modern make than the others, and, though a stout\npiece of work, it has little of their ponderous strength.\n\nI must explain here, that there is a small, raised lawn on this side of\nthe house, upon which this door opens--the windows of the study being\nbarred on this account. All the other entrances--excepting the great\ngateway which is never opened--are in the lower storey.\n\n\n\n_VII_\n\nTHE ATTACK\n\nI spent some time, puzzling how to strengthen the study door. Finally,\nI went down to the kitchen, and with some trouble, brought up several\nheavy pieces of timber. These, I wedged up, slantwise, against it, from\nthe floor, nailing them top and bottom. For half-an-hour, I worked hard,\nand, at last, got it shored to my mind.\n\nThen, feeling easier, I resumed my coat, which I had laid aside, and\nproceeded to attend to one or two matters before returning to the tower.\nIt was whilst thus employed, that I heard a fumbling at the door, and\nthe latch was tried. Keeping silence, I waited. Soon, I heard several of\nthe creatures outside. They were grunting to one another, softly. Then,\nfor a minute, there was quietness. Suddenly, there sounded a quick, low\ngrunt, and the door creaked under a tremendous pressure. It would have\nburst inward; but for the supports I had placed. The strain ceased, as\nquickly as it had begun, and there was more talk.\n\nPresently, one of the Things squealed, softly, and I heard the sound\nof others approaching. There was a short confabulation; then again,\nsilence; and I realized that they had called several more to assist.\nFeeling that now was the supreme moment, I stood ready, with my rifle\npresented. If the door gave, I would, at least, slay as many\nas possible.\n\nAgain came the low signal; and, once more, the door cracked, under a\nhuge force. For, a minute perhaps, the pressure was kept up; and I\nwaited, nervously; expecting each moment to see the door come down with\na crash. But no; the struts held, and the attempt proved abortive. Then\nfollowed more of their horrible, grunting talk, and, whilst it lasted, I\nthought I distinguished the noise of fresh arrivals.\n\nAfter a long discussion, during which the door was several times\nshaken, they became quiet once more, and I knew that they were going to\nmake a third attempt to break it down. I was almost in despair. The\nprops had been severely tried in the two previous attacks, and I was\nsorely afraid that this would prove too much for them.\n\nAt that moment, like an inspiration, a thought flashed into my troubled\nbrain. Instantly, for it was no time to hesitate, I ran from the room,\nand up stair after stair. This time, it was not to one of the towers,\nthat I went; but out on to the flat, leaded roof itself. Once there, I\nraced across to the parapet, that walls it 'round, and looked down. As I\ndid so, I heard the short, grunted signal, and, even up there, caught\nthe crying of the door under the assault.\n\nThere was not a moment to lose, and, leaning over, I aimed, quickly,\nand fired. The report rang sharply, and, almost blending with it, came\nthe loud splud of the bullet striking its mark. From below, rose a\nshrill wail; and the door ceased its groaning. Then, as I took my weight\nfrom off the parapet, a huge piece of the stone coping slid from under\nme, and fell with a crash among the disorganized throng beneath.\nSeveral horrible shrieks quavered through the night air, and then I\nheard a sound of scampering feet. Cautiously, I looked over. In the\nmoonlight, I could see the great copingstone, lying right across the\nthreshold of the door. I thought I saw something under it--several\nthings, white; but I could not be sure.\n\nAnd so a few minutes passed.\n\nAs I stared, I saw something come 'round, out of the shadow of the\nhouse. It was one of the Things. It went up to the stone, silently, and\nbent down. I was unable to see what it did. In a minute it stood up. It\nhad something in its talons, which it put to its mouth and tore at....\n\nFor the moment, I did not realize. Then, slowly, I comprehended. The\nThing was stooping again. It was horrible. I started to load my rifle.\nWhen I looked again, the monster was tugging at the stone--moving it to\none side. I leant the rifle on the coping, and pulled the trigger. The\nbrute collapsed, on its face, and kicked, slightly.\n\nSimultaneously, almost, with the report, I heard another sound--that of\nbreaking glass. Waiting, only to recharge my weapon, I ran from the\nroof, and down the first two flights of stairs.\n\nHere, I paused to listen. As I did so, there came another tinkle of\nfalling glass. It appeared to come from the floor below. Excitedly, I\nsprang down the steps, and, guided by the rattle of the window-sash,\nreached the door of one of the empty bedrooms, at the back of the house.\nI thrust it open. The room was but dimly illuminated by the moonlight;\nmost of the light being blotted out by moving figures at the window.\nEven as I stood, one crawled through, into the room. Leveling my weapon,\nI fired point-blank at it--filling the room with a deafening bang. When\nthe smoke cleared, I saw that the room was empty, and the window free.\nThe room was much lighter. The night air blew in, coldly, through the\nshattered panes. Down below, in the night, I could hear a soft moaning,\nand a confused murmur of swine-voices.\n\nStepping to one side of the window, I reloaded, and then stood there,\nwaiting. Presently, I heard a scuffling noise. From where I stood in the\nshadow, I could see, without being seen.\n\nNearer came the sounds, and then I saw something come up above the\nsill, and clutch at the broken window-frame. It caught a piece of the\nwoodwork; and, now, I could make out that it was a hand and arm. A\nmoment later, the face of one of the Swine-creatures rose into view.\nThen, before I could use my rifle, or do anything, there came a sharp\ncrack--cr-ac-k; and the window-frame gave way under the weight of the\nThing. Next instant, a squashing thud, and a loud outcry, told me that\nit had fallen to the ground. With a savage hope that it had been killed,\nI went to the window. The moon had gone behind a cloud, so that I could\nsee nothing; though a steady hum of jabbering, just beneath where I\nstood, indicated that there were several more of the brutes close\nat hand.\n\nAs I stood there, looking down, I marveled how it had been possible for\nthe creatures to climb so far; for the wall is comparatively smooth,\nwhile the distance to the ground must be, at least, eighty feet.\n\nAll at once, as I bent, peering, I saw something, indistinctly, that\ncut the grey shadow of the house-side, with a black line. It passed the\nwindow, to the left, at a distance of about two feet. Then, I remembered\nthat it was a gutter-pipe, that had been put there some years ago, to\ncarry off the rainwater. I had forgotten about it. I could see, now, how\nthe creatures had managed to reach the window. Even as the solution came\nto me, I heard a faint slithering, scratching noise, and knew that\nanother of the brutes was coming. I waited some odd moments; then leant\nout of the window and felt the pipe. To my delight, I found that it was\nquite loose, and I managed, using the rifle-barrel as a crowbar, to\nlever it out from the wall. I worked quickly. Then, taking hold with\nboth bands, I wrenched the whole concern away, and hurled it down--with\nthe Thing still clinging to it--into the garden.\n\nFor a few minutes longer, I waited there, listening; but, after the\nfirst general outcry, I heard nothing. I knew, now, that there was no\nmore reason to fear an attack from this quarter. I had removed the only\nmeans of reaching the window, and, as none of the other windows had any\nadjacent water pipes, to tempt the climbing powers of the monsters, I\nbegan to feel more confident of escaping their clutches.\n\nLeaving the room, I made my way down to the study. I was anxious to see\nhow the door had withstood the test of that last assault. Entering, I\nlit two of the candles, and then turned to the door. One of the large\nprops had been displaced, and, on that side, the door had been forced\ninward some six inches.\n\nIt was Providential that I had managed to drive the brutes away just\nwhen I did! And that copingstone! I wondered, vaguely, how I had managed\nto dislodge it. I had not noticed it loose, as I took my shot; and then,\nas I stood up, it had slipped away from beneath me ... I felt that I\nowed the dismissal of the attacking force, more to its timely fall than\nto my rifle. Then the thought came, that I had better seize this chance\nto shore up the door, again. It was evident that the creatures had not\nreturned since the fall of the copingstone; but who was to say how long\nthey would keep away?\n\nThere and then, I set-to, at repairing the door--working hard and\nanxiously. First, I went down to the basement, and, rummaging 'round,\nfound several pieces of heavy oak planking. With these, I returned to\nthe study, and, having removed the props, placed the planks up against\nthe door. Then, I nailed the heads of the struts to these, and, driving\nthem well home at the bottoms, nailed them again there.\n\nThus, I made the door stronger than ever; for now it was solid with the\nbacking of boards, and would, I felt convinced, stand a heavier pressure\nthan hitherto, without giving way.\n\nAfter that, I lit the lamp which I had brought from the kitchen, and\nwent down to have a look at the lower windows.\n\nNow that I had seen an instance of the strength the creatures\npossessed, I felt considerable anxiety about the windows on the ground\nfloor--in spite of the fact that they were so strongly barred.\n\nI went first to the buttery, having a vivid remembrance of my late\nadventure there. The place was chilly, and the wind, soughing in through\nthe broken glass, produced an eerie note. Apart from the general air of\ndismalness, the place was as I had left it the night before. Going up to\nthe window, I examined the bars, closely; noting, as I did so, their\ncomfortable thickness. Still, as I looked more intently, it seemed to\nme, that the middle bar was bent slightly from the straight; yet it was\nbut trifling, and it might have been so for years. I had never, before,\nnoticed them particularly.\n\nI put my hand through the broken window, and shook the bar. It was as\nfirm as a rock. Perhaps the creatures had tried to 'start' it, and,\nfinding it beyond their power, ceased from the effort. After that, I\nwent 'round to each of the windows, in turn; examining them with careful\nattention; but nowhere else could I trace anything to show that there\nhad been any tampering. Having finished my survey, I went back to the\nstudy, and poured myself out a little brandy. Then to the tower\nto watch.\n\n\n\n_VIII_\n\nAFTER THE ATTACK\n\nIt was now about three a.m., and, presently, the Eastern sky began to\npale with the coming of dawn. Gradually, the day came, and, by its\nlight, I scanned the gardens, earnestly; but nowhere could I see any\nsigns of the brutes. I leant over, and glanced down to the foot of the\nwall, to see whether the body of the Thing I had shot the night before\nwas still there. It was gone. I supposed that others of the monsters had\nremoved it during the night.\n\nThen, I went down on to the roof, and crossed over to the gap from\nwhich the coping stone had fallen. Reaching it, I looked over. Yes,\nthere was the stone, as I had seen it last; but there was no appearance\nof anything beneath it; nor could I see the creatures I had killed,\nafter its fall. Evidently, they also had been taken away. I turned, and\nwent down to my study. There, I sat down, wearily. I was thoroughly\ntired. It was quite light now; though the sun's rays were not, as yet,\nperceptibly hot. A clock chimed the hour of four.\n\nI awoke, with a start, and looked 'round, hurriedly. The clock in the\ncorner, indicated that it was three o'clock. It was already afternoon. I\nmust have slept for nearly eleven hours.\n\nWith a jerky movement, I sat forward in the chair, and listened. The\nhouse was perfectly silent. Slowly, I stood up, and yawned. I felt\ndesperately tired, still, and sat down again; wondering what it was that\nhad waked me.\n\nIt must have been the clock striking, I concluded, presently; and was\ncommencing to doze off, when a sudden noise brought me back, once more,\nto life. It was the sound of a step, as of a person moving cautiously\ndown the corridor, toward my study. In an instant, I was on my feet, and\ngrasping my rifle. Noiselessly, I waited. Had the creatures broken in,\nwhilst I slept? Even as I questioned, the steps reached my door, halted\nmomentarily, and then continued down the passage. Silently, I tiptoed to\nthe doorway, and peeped out. Then, I experienced such a feeling of\nrelief, as must a reprieved criminal--it was my sister. She was going\ntoward the stairs.\n\nI stepped into the hall, and was about to call to her, when it occurred\nto me, that it was very queer she should have crept past my door, in\nthat stealthy manner. I was puzzled, and, for one brief moment, the\nthought occupied my mind, that it was not she, but some fresh mystery of\nthe house. Then, as I caught a glimpse of her old petticoat, the thought\npassed as quickly as it had come, and I half laughed. There could be no\nmistaking that ancient garment. Yet, I wondered what she was doing; and,\nremembering her condition of mind, on the previous day, I felt that it\nmight be best to follow, quietly--taking care not to alarm her--and see\nwhat she was going to do. If she behaved rationally, well and good; if\nnot, I should have to take steps to restrain her. I could run no\nunnecessary risks, under the danger that threatened us.\n\nQuickly, I reached the head of the stairs, and paused a moment. Then,\nI heard a sound that sent me leaping down, at a mad rate--it was the\nrattle of bolts being unshot. That foolish sister of mine was actually\nunbarring the back door.\n\nJust as her hand was on the last bolt, I reached her. She had not seen\nme, and, the first thing she knew, I had hold of her arm. She glanced up\nquickly, like a frightened animal, and screamed aloud.\n\n'Come, Mary!' I said, sternly, 'what's the meaning of this nonsense? Do\nyou mean to tell me you don't understand the danger, that you try to\nthrow our two lives away in this fashion!'\n\nTo this, she replied nothing; only trembled, violently, gasping and\nsobbing, as though in the last extremity of fear.\n\nThrough some minutes, I reasoned with her; pointing out the need for\ncaution, and asking her to be brave. There was little to be afraid of\nnow, I explained--and, I tried to believe that I spoke the truth--but\nshe must be sensible, and not attempt to leave the house for a few days.\n\nAt last, I ceased, in despair. It was no use talking to her; she was,\nobviously, not quite herself for the time being. Finally, I told her she\nhad better go to her room, if she could not behave rationally.\n\nStill, she took not any notice. So, without more ado, I picked her up\nin my arms, and carried her there. At first, she screamed, wildly; but\nhad relapsed into silent trembling, by the time I reached the stairs.\n\nArriving at her room, I laid her upon the bed. She lay there quietly\nenough, neither speaking nor sobbing--just shaking in a very ague of\nfear. I took a rug from a chair near by, and spread it over her. I could\ndo nothing more for her, and so, crossed to where Pepper lay in a big\nbasket. My sister had taken charge of him since his wound, to nurse him,\nfor it had proved more severe than I had thought, and I was pleased to\nnote that, in spite of her state of mind, she had looked after the old\ndog, carefully. Stooping, I spoke to him, and, in reply, he licked my\nhand, feebly. He was too ill to do more.\n\nThen, going to the bed, I bent over my sister, and asked her how she\nfelt; but she only shook the more, and, much as it pained me, I had to\nadmit that my presence seemed to make her worse.\n\nAnd so, I left her--locking the door, and pocketing the key. It seemed\nto be the only course to take.\n\nThe rest of the day, I spent between the tower and my study. For food,\nI brought up a loaf from the pantry, and on this, and some claret, I\nlived for that day.\n\nWhat a long, weary day it was. If only I could have gone out into the\ngardens, as is my wont, I should have been content enough; but to be\ncooped in this silent house, with no companion, save a mad woman and a\nsick dog, was enough to prey upon the nerves of the hardiest. And out in\nthe tangled shrubberies that surrounded the house, lurked--for all I\ncould tell--those infernal Swine-creatures waiting their chance. Was\never a man in such straits?\n\nOnce, in the afternoon, and again, later, I went to visit my sister.\nThe second time, I found her tending Pepper; but, at my approach, she\nslid over, unobtrusively, to the far corner, with a gesture that\nsaddened me beyond belief. Poor girl! her fear cut me intolerably, and I\nwould not intrude on her, unnecessarily. She would be better, I trusted,\nin a few days; meanwhile, I could do nothing; and I judged it still\nneedful--hard as it seemed--to keep her confined to her room. One thing\nthere was that I took for encouragement: she had eaten some of the food\nI had taken to her, on my first visit.\n\nAnd so the day passed.\n\nAs the evening drew on, the air grew chilly, and I began to make\npreparations for passing a second night in the tower--taking up two\nadditional rifles, and a heavy ulster. The rifles I loaded, and laid\nalongside my other; as I intended to make things warm for any of the\ncreatures who might show, during the night. I had plenty of ammunition,\nand I thought to give the brutes such a lesson, as should show them the\nuselessness of attempting to force an entrance.\n\nAfter that, I made the 'round of the house again; paying particular\nattention to the props that supported the study door. Then, feeling that\nI had done all that lay in my power to insure our safety, I returned to\nthe tower; calling in on my sister and Pepper, for a final visit, on the\nway. Pepper was asleep; but woke, as I entered, and wagged his tail, in\nrecognition. I thought he seemed slightly better. My sister was lying on\nthe bed; though whether asleep or not, I was unable to tell; and thus I\nleft them.\n\nReaching the tower, I made myself as comfortable as circumstances would\npermit, and settled down to watch through the night. Gradually, darkness\nfell, and soon the details of the gardens were merged into shadows.\nDuring the first few hours, I sat, alert, listening for any sound that\nmight help to tell me if anything were stirring down below. It was far\ntoo dark for my eyes to be of much use.\n\nSlowly, the hours passed; without anything unusual happening. And the\nmoon rose, showing the gardens, apparently empty, and silent. And so,\nthrough the night, without disturbance or sound.\n\nToward morning, I began to grow stiff and cold, with my long vigil;\nalso, I was getting very uneasy, concerning the continued quietness on\nthe part of the creatures. I mistrusted it, and would sooner, far, have\nhad them attack the house, openly. Then, at least, I should have known\nmy danger, and been able to meet it; but to wait like this, through a\nwhole night, picturing all kinds of unknown devilment, was to jeopardize\none's sanity. Once or twice, the thought came to me, that, perhaps, they\nhad gone; but, in my heart, I found it impossible to believe that it\nwas so.\n\n\n\n_IX_\n\nIN THE CELLARS\n\nAt last, what with being tired and cold, and the uneasiness that\npossessed me, I resolved to take a walk through the house; first calling\nin at the study, for a glass of brandy to warm me. This, I did, and,\nwhile there, I examined the door, carefully; but found all as I had left\nit the night before.\n\nThe day was just breaking, as I left the tower; though it was still too\ndark in the house to be able to see without a light, and I took one of\nthe study candles with me on my 'round. By the time I had finished the\nground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred\nwindows. My search had shown me nothing fresh. Everything appeared to be\nin order, and I was on the point of extinguishing my candle, when the\nthought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round the\ncellars. I had not, if I remember rightly, been into them since my hasty\nsearch on the evening of the attack.\n\nFor, perhaps, the half of a minute, I hesitated. I would have been very\nwilling to forego the task--as, indeed, I am inclined to think any man\nwell might--for of all the great, awe-inspiring rooms in this house, the\ncellars are the hugest and weirdest. Great, gloomy caverns of places,\nunlit by any ray of daylight. Yet, I would not shirk the work. I felt\nthat to do so would smack of sheer cowardice. Besides, as I reassured\nmyself, the cellars were really the most unlikely places in which to\ncome across anything dangerous; considering that they can be entered,\nonly through a heavy oaken door, the key of which, I carry always on\nmy person.\n\nIt is in the smallest of these places that I keep my wine; a gloomy\nhole close to the foot of the cellar stairs; and beyond which, I have\nseldom proceeded. Indeed, save for the rummage 'round, already\nmentioned, I doubt whether I had ever, before, been right through\nthe cellars.\n\nAs I unlocked the great door, at the top of the steps, I paused,\nnervously, a moment, at the strange, desolate smell that assailed my\nnostrils. Then, throwing the barrel of my weapon forward, I descended,\nslowly, into the darkness of the underground regions.\n\nReaching the bottom of the stairs, I stood for a minute, and listened.\nAll was silent, save for a faint drip, drip of water, falling,\ndrop-by-drop, somewhere to my left. As I stood, I noticed how quietly\nthe candle burnt; never a flicker nor flare, so utterly windless was\nthe place.\n\nQuietly, I moved from cellar to cellar. I had but a very dim memory of\ntheir arrangement. The impressions left by my first search were blurred.\nI had recollections of a succession of great cellars, and of one,\ngreater than the rest, the roof of which was upheld by pillars; beyond\nthat my mind was hazy, and predominated by a sense of cold and darkness\nand shadows. Now, however, it was different; for, although nervous, I\nwas sufficiently collected to be able to look about me, and note the\nstructure and size of the different vaults I entered.\n\nOf course, with the amount of light given by my candle, it was not\npossible to examine each place, minutely, but I was enabled to notice,\nas I went along, that the walls appeared to be built with wonderful\nprecision and finish; while here and there, an occasional, massive\npillar shot up to support the vaulted roof.\n\nThus, I came, at last, to the great cellar that I remembered. It is\nreached, through a huge, arched entrance, on which I observed strange,\nfantastic carvings, which threw queer shadows under the light of my\ncandle. As I stood, and examined these, thoughtfully, it occurred to me\nhow strange it was, that I should be so little acquainted with my own\nhouse. Yet, this may be easily understood, when one realizes the size of\nthis ancient pile, and the fact that only my old sister and I live in\nit, occupying a few of the rooms, such as our wants decide.\n\nHolding the light high, I passed on into the cellar, and, keeping to\nthe right, paced slowly up, until I reached the further end. I walked\nquietly, and looked cautiously about, as I went. But, so far as the\nlight showed, I saw nothing unusual.\n\nAt the top, I turned to the left, still keeping to the wall, and so\ncontinued, until I had traversed the whole of the vast chamber. As I\nmoved along, I noticed that the floor was composed of solid rock, in\nplaces covered with a damp mould, in others bare, or almost so, save for\na thin coating of light-grey dust.\n\nI had halted at the doorway. Now, however, I turned, and made my way up\nthe center of the place; passing among the pillars, and glancing to\nright and left, as I moved. About halfway up the cellar, I stubbed my\nfoot against something that gave out a metallic sound. Stooping quickly,\nI held the candle, and saw that the object I had kicked, was a large,\nmetal ring. Bending lower, I cleared the dust from around it, and,\npresently, discovered that it was attached to a ponderous trap door,\nblack with age.\n\nFeeling excited, and wondering to where it could lead, I laid my gun on\nthe floor, and, sticking the candle in the trigger guard, took the ring\nin both hands, and pulled. The trap creaked loudly--the sound echoing,\nvaguely, through the huge place--and opened, heavily.\n\nPropping the edge on my knee, I reached for the candle, and held it in\nthe opening, moving it to right and left; but could see nothing. I was\npuzzled and surprised. There were no signs of steps, nor even the\nappearance of there ever having been any. Nothing; save an empty\nblackness. I might have been looking down into a bottomless, sideless\nwell. Then, even as I stared, full of perplexity, I seemed to hear, far\ndown, as though from untold depths, a faint whisper of sound. I bent my\nhead, quickly, more into the opening, and listened, intently. It may\nhave been fancy; but I could have sworn to hearing a soft titter, that\ngrew into a hideous, chuckling, faint and distant. Startled, I leapt\nbackward, letting the trap fall, with a hollow clang, that filled the\nplace with echoes. Even then, I seemed to hear that mocking, suggestive\nlaughter; but this, I knew, must be my imagination. The sound, I had\nheard, was far too slight to penetrate through the cumbrous trap.\n\nFor a full minute, I stood there, quivering--glancing, nervously,\nbehind and before; but the great cellar was silent as a grave, and,\ngradually, I shook off the frightened sensation. With a calmer mind, I\nbecame again curious to know into what that trap opened; but could not,\nthen, summon sufficient courage to make a further investigation. One\nthing I felt, however, was that the trap ought to be secured. This, I\naccomplished by placing upon it several large pieces of 'dressed'\nstone, which I had noticed in my tour along the East wall.\n\nThen, after a final scrutiny of the rest of the place, I retraced my\nway through the cellars, to the stairs, and so reached the daylight,\nwith an infinite feeling of relief, that the uncomfortable task was\naccomplished.\n\n\n\n_X_\n\nTHE TIME OF WAITING\n\nThe sun was now warm, and shining brightly, forming a wondrous contrast\nto the dark and dismal cellars; and it was with comparatively light\nfeelings, that I made my way up to the tower, to survey the gardens.\nThere, I found everything quiet, and, after a few minutes, went down to\nMary's room.\n\nHere, having knocked, and received a reply, I unlocked the door. My\nsister was sitting, quietly, on the bed; as though waiting. She seemed\nquite herself again, and made no attempt to move away, as I approached;\nyet, I observed that she scanned my face, anxiously, as though in doubt,\nand but half assured in her mind that there was nothing to fear from me.\n\nTo my questions, as to how she felt, she replied, sanely enough, that\nshe was hungry, and would like to go down to prepare breakfast, if I did\nnot mind. For a minute, I meditated whether it would be safe to let her\nout. Finally, I told her she might go, on condition that she promised\nnot to attempt to leave the house, or meddle with any of the outer\ndoors. At my mention of the doors, a sudden look of fright crossed her\nface; but she said nothing, save to give the required promise, and then\nleft the room, silently.\n\nCrossing the floor, I approached Pepper. He had waked as I entered;\nbut, beyond a slight yelp of pleasure, and a soft rapping with his tail,\nhad kept quiet. Now, as I patted him, he made an attempt to stand up,\nand succeeded, only to fall back on his side, with a little yowl\nof pain.\n\nI spoke to him, and bade him lie still. I was greatly delighted with\nhis improvement, and also with the natural kindness of my sister's\nheart, in taking such good care of him, in spite of her condition of\nmind. After a while, I left him, and went downstairs, to my study.\n\nIn a little time, Mary appeared, carrying a tray on which smoked a hot\nbreakfast. As she entered the room, I saw her gaze fasten on the props\nthat supported the study door; her lips tightened, and I thought she\npaled, slightly; but that was all. Putting the tray down at my elbow,\nshe was leaving the room, quietly, when I called her back. She came, it\nseemed, a little timidly, as though startled; and I noted that her hand\nclutched at her apron, nervously.\n\n'Come, Mary,' I said. 'Cheer up! Things look brighter. I've seen none\nof the creatures since yesterday morning, early.'\n\nShe looked at me, in a curiously puzzled manner; as though not\ncomprehending. Then, intelligence swept into her eyes, and fear; but she\nsaid nothing, beyond an unintelligible murmur of acquiescence. After\nthat, I kept silence; it was evident that any reference to the\nSwine-things, was more than her shaken nerves could bear.\n\nBreakfast over, I went up to the tower. Here, during the greater part\nof the day, I maintained a strict watch over the gardens. Once or twice,\nI went down to the basement, to see how my sister was getting along.\nEach time, I found her quiet, and curiously submissive. Indeed, on the\nlast occasion, she even ventured to address me, on her own account, with\nregard to some household matter that needed attention. Though this was\ndone with an almost extraordinary timidity, I hailed it with happiness,\nas being the first word, voluntarily spoken, since the critical moment,\nwhen I had caught her unbarring the back door, to go out among those\nwaiting brutes. I wondered whether she was aware of her attempt, and how\nnear a thing it had been; but refrained from questioning her, thinking\nit best to let well alone.\n\nThat night, I slept in a bed; the first time for two nights. In the\nmorning, I rose early, and took a walk through the house. All was as it\nshould be, and I went up to the tower, to have a look at the gardens.\nHere, again, I found perfect quietness.\n\nAt breakfast, when I met Mary, I was greatly pleased to see that she\nhad sufficiently regained command over herself, to be able to greet me\nin a perfectly natural manner. She talked sensibly and quietly; only\nkeeping carefully from any mention of the past couple of days. In this,\nI humored her, to the extent of not attempting to lead the conversation\nin that direction.\n\nEarlier in the morning, I had been to see Pepper. He was mending,\nrapidly; and bade fair to be on his legs, in earnest, in another day or\ntwo. Before leaving the breakfast table, I made some reference to his\nimprovement. In the short discussion that followed, I was surprised to\ngather, from my sister's remarks, that she was still under the\nimpression that his wound had been given by the wildcat, of my\ninvention. It made me feel almost ashamed of myself for deceiving her.\nYet, the lie had been told to prevent her from being frightened. And\nthen, I had been sure that she must have known the truth, later, when\nthose brutes had attacked the house.\n\nDuring the day, I kept on the alert; spending much of my time, as on\nthe previous day, in the tower; but not a sign could I see of the\nSwine-creatures, nor hear any sound. Several times, the thought had come\nto me, that the Things had, at last, left us; but, up to this time, I\nhad refused to entertain the idea, seriously; now, however, I began to\nfeel that there was reason for hope. It would soon be three days since I\nhad seen any of the Things; but still, I intended to use the utmost\ncaution. For all that I could tell, this protracted silence might be a\nruse to tempt me from the house--perhaps right into their arms. The\nthought of such a contingency, was, alone, sufficient to make me\ncircumspect.\n\nSo it was, that the fourth, fifth and sixth days went by, quietly,\nwithout my making any attempt to leave the house.\n\nOn the sixth day, I had the pleasure of seeing Pepper, once more, upon\nhis feet; and, though still very weak, he managed to keep me company\nduring the whole of that day.\n\n\n\n_XI_\n\nTHE SEARCHING OF THE GARDENS\n\nHow slowly the time went; and never a thing to indicate that any of the\nbrutes still infested the gardens.\n\nIt was on the ninth day that, finally, I decided to run the risk, if\nany there were, and sally out. With this purpose in view, I loaded one\nof the shotguns, carefully--choosing it, as being more deadly than a\nrifle, at close quarters; and then, after a final scrutiny of the\ngrounds, from the tower, I called Pepper to follow me, and made my way\ndown to the basement.\n\nAt the door, I must confess to hesitating a moment. The thought of what\nmight be awaiting me among the dark shrubberies, was by no means\ncalculated to encourage my resolution. It was but a second, though, and\nthen I had drawn the bolts, and was standing on the path outside\nthe door.\n\nPepper followed, stopping at the doorstep to sniff, suspiciously; and\ncarrying his nose up and down the jambs, as though following a scent.\nThen, suddenly, he turned, sharply, and started to run here and there,\nin semicircles and circles, all around the door; finally returning to\nthe threshold. Here, he began again to nose about.\n\nHitherto, I had stood, watching the dog; yet, all the time, with half\nmy gaze on the wild tangle of gardens, stretching 'round me. Now, I went\ntoward him, and, bending down, examined the surface of the door, where\nhe was smelling. I found that the wood was covered with a network of\nscratches, crossing and recrossing one another, in inextricable\nconfusion. In addition to this, I noticed that the doorposts,\nthemselves, were gnawed in places. Beyond these, I could find nothing;\nand so, standing up, I began to make the tour of the house wall.\n\nPepper, as soon as I walked away, left the door, and ran ahead, still\nnosing and sniffing as he went along. At times, he stopped to\ninvestigate. Here, it would be a bullet-hole in the pathway, or,\nperhaps, a powder stained wad. Anon, it might be a piece of torn sod, or\na disturbed patch of weedy path; but, save for such trifles, he found\nnothing. I observed him, critically, as he went along, and could\ndiscover nothing of uneasiness, in his demeanor, to indicate that he\nfelt the nearness of any of the creatures. By this, I was assured that\nthe gardens were empty, at least for the present, of those hateful\nThings. Pepper could not be easily deceived, and it was a relief to feel\nthat he would know, and give me timely warning, if there were\nany danger.\n\nReaching the place where I had shot that first creature, I stopped, and\nmade a careful scrutiny; but could see nothing. From there, I went on to\nwhere the great copingstone had fallen. It lay on its side, apparently\njust as it had been left when I shot the brute that was moving it. A\ncouple of feet to the right of the nearer end, was a great dent in the\nground; showing where it had struck. The other end was still within the\nindentation--half in, and half out. Going nearer, I looked at the stone,\nmore closely. What a huge piece of masonry it was! And that creature had\nmoved it, single-handed, in its attempt to reach what lay below.\n\nI went 'round to the further end of the stone. Here, I found that it\nwas possible to see under it, for a distance of nearly a couple of feet.\nStill, I could see nothing of the stricken creatures, and I felt much\nsurprised. I had, as I have before said, guessed that the remains had\nbeen removed; yet, I could not conceive that it had been done so\nthoroughly as not to leave some certain sign, beneath the stone,\nindicative of their fate. I had seen several of the brutes struck down\nbeneath it, with such force that they must have been literally driven\ninto the earth; and now, not a vestige of them was to be seen--not even\na bloodstain.\n\nI felt more puzzled, than ever, as I turned the matter over in my mind;\nbut could think of no plausible explanation; and so, finally, gave it\nup, as one of the many things that were unexplainable.\n\nFrom there, I transferred my attention to the study door. I could see,\nnow, even more plainly, the effects of the tremendous strain, to which\nit had been subjected; and I marveled how, even with the support\nafforded by the props, it had withstood the attacks, so well. There were\nno marks of blows--indeed, none had been given--but the door had been\nliterally riven from its hinges, by the application of enormous, silent\nforce. One thing that I observed affected me profoundly--the head of one\nof the props had been driven right through a panel. This was, of itself,\nsufficient to show how huge an effort the creatures had made to break\ndown the door, and how nearly they had succeeded.\n\nLeaving, I continued my tour 'round the house, finding little else of\ninterest; save at the back, where I came across the piece of piping I\nhad torn from the wall, lying among the long grass underneath the\nbroken window.\n\nThen, I returned to the house, and, having re-bolted the back door,\nwent up to the tower. Here, I spent the afternoon, reading, and\noccasionally glancing down into the gardens. I had determined, if the\nnight passed quietly, to go as far as the Pit, on the morrow. Perhaps, I\nshould be able to learn, then, something of what had happened. The day\nslipped away, and the night came, and went much as the last few\nnights had gone.\n\nWhen I rose the morning had broken, fine and clear; and I determined to\nput my project into action. During breakfast, I considered the matter,\ncarefully; after which, I went to the study for my shotgun. In addition,\nI loaded, and slipped into my pocket, a small, but heavy, pistol. I\nquite understood that, if there were any danger, it lay in the direction\nof the Pit and I intended to be prepared.\n\nLeaving the study, I went down to the back door, followed by Pepper.\nOnce outside, I took a quick survey of the surrounding gardens, and then\nset off toward the Pit. On the way, I kept a sharp outlook, holding my\ngun, handily. Pepper was running ahead, I noticed, without any apparent\nhesitation. From this, I augured that there was no imminent danger to be\napprehended, and I stepped out more quickly in his wake. He had reached\nthe top of the Pit, now, and was nosing his way along the edge.\n\nA minute later, I was beside him, looking down into the Pit. For a\nmoment, I could scarcely believe that it was the same place, so greatly\nwas it changed. The dark, wooded ravine of a fortnight ago, with a\nfoliage-hidden stream, running sluggishly, at the bottom, existed no\nlonger. Instead, my eyes showed me a ragged chasm, partly filled with a\ngloomy lake of turbid water. All one side of the ravine was stripped of\nunderwood, showing the bare rock.\n\nA little to my left, the side of the Pit appeared to have collapsed\naltogether, forming a deep V-shaped cleft in the face of the rocky\ncliff. This rift ran, from the upper edge of the ravine, nearly down to\nthe water, and penetrated into the Pit side, to a distance of some forty\nfeet. Its opening was, at least, six yards across; and, from this, it\nseemed to taper into about two. But, what attracted my attention, more\nthan even the stupendous split itself, was a great hole, some distance\ndown the cleft, and right in the angle of the V. It was clearly defined,\nand not unlike an arched doorway in shape; though, lying as it did in\nthe shadow, I could not see it very distinctly.\n\nThe opposite side of the Pit, still retained its verdure; but so torn\nin places, and everywhere covered with dust and rubbish, that it was\nhardly distinguishable as such.\n\nMy first impression, that there had been a land slip, was, I began to\nsee, not sufficient, of itself, to account for all the changes I\nwitnessed. And the water--? I turned, suddenly; for I had become aware\nthat, somewhere to my right, there was a noise of running water. I could\nsee nothing; but, now that my attention had been caught, I\ndistinguished, easily, that it came from somewhere at the East end\nof the Pit.\n\nSlowly, I made my way in that direction; the sound growing plainer as I\nadvanced, until in a little, I stood right above it. Even then, I could\nnot perceive the cause, until I knelt down, and thrust my head over the\ncliff. Here, the noise came up to me, plainly; and I saw, below me, a\ntorrent of clear water, issuing from a small fissure in the Pit side,\nand rushing down the rocks, into the lake beneath. A little further\nalong the cliff, I saw another, and, beyond that again, two smaller\nones. These, then, would help to account for the quantity of water in\nthe Pit; and, if the fall of rock and earth had blocked the outlet of\nthe stream at the bottom, there was little doubt but that it was\ncontributing a very large share.\n\nYet, I puzzled my head to account for the generally _shaken_ appearance\nof the place--these streamlets, and that huge cleft, further up the\nravine! It seemed to me, that more than the landslip was necessary to\naccount for these. I could imagine an earthquake, or a great\n_explosion_, creating some such condition of affairs as existed; but, of\nthese, there had been neither. Then, I stood up, quickly, remembering\nthat crash, and the cloud of dust that had followed, directly, rushing\nhigh into the air. But I shook my head, unbelievingly. No! It must have\nbeen the noise of the falling rocks and earth, I had heard; of course,\nthe dust would fly, naturally. Still, in spite of my reasoning, I had an\nuneasy feeling, that this theory did not satisfy my sense of the\nprobable; and yet, was any other, that I could suggest, likely to be\nhalf so plausible? Pepper had been sitting on the grass, while I\nconducted my examination. Now, as I turned up the North side of the\nravine, he rose and followed.\n\nSlowly, and keeping a careful watch in all directions, I made the\ncircuit of the Pit; but found little else, that I had not already seen.\nFrom the West end, I could see the four waterfalls, uninterruptedly.\nThey were some considerable distance up from the surface of the\nlake--about fifty feet, I calculated.\n\nFor a little while longer, I loitered about; keeping my eyes and ears\nopen, but still, without seeing or hearing anything suspicious. The\nwhole place was wonderfully quiet; indeed, save for the continuous\nmurmur of the water, at the top end, no sound, of any description, broke\nthe silence.\n\nAll this while, Pepper had shown no signs of uneasiness. This seemed,\nto me, to indicate that, for the time being, at least, there was none of\nthe Swine-creatures in the vicinity. So far as I could see, his\nattention appeared to have been taken, chiefly, with scratching and\nsniffing among the grass at the edge of the Pit. At times, he would\nleave the edge, and run along toward the house, as though following\ninvisible tracks; but, in all cases, returning after a few minutes. I\nhad little doubt but that he was really tracing out the footsteps of the\nSwine-things; and the very fact that each one seemed to lead him back to\nthe Pit, appeared to me, a proof that the brutes had all returned whence\nthey came.\n\nAt noon, I went home, for dinner. During the afternoon, I made a\npartial search of the gardens, accompanied by Pepper; but, without\ncoming upon anything to indicate the presence of the creatures.\n\nOnce, as we made our way through the shrubberies, Pepper rushed in\namong some bushes, with a fierce yelp. At that, I jumped back, in sudden\nfright, and threw my gun forward, in readiness; only to laugh,\nnervously, as Pepper reappeared, chasing an unfortunate cat. Toward\nevening, I gave up the search, and returned to the house. All at once,\nas we were passing a great clump of bushes, on our right, Pepper\ndisappeared, and I could hear him sniffing and growling among them, in a\nsuspicious manner. With my gun barrel, I parted the intervening\nshrubbery, and looked inside. There was nothing to be seen, save that\nmany of the branches were bent down, and broken; as though some animal\nhad made a lair there, at no very previous date. It was probably, I\nthought, one of the places occupied by some of the Swine-creatures, on\nthe night of the attack.\n\nNext day, I resumed my search through the gardens; but without result.\nBy evening, I had been right through them, and now, I knew, beyond the\npossibility of doubt, that there were no longer any of the Things\nconcealed about the place. Indeed, I have often thought since, that I\nwas correct in my earlier surmise, that they had left soon after\nthe attack.\n\n\n\n_XII_\n\nTHE SUBTERRANEAN PIT\n\nAnother week came and went, during which I spent a great deal of my time\nabout the Pit mouth. I had come to the conclusion a few days earlier,\nthat the arched hole, in the angle of the great rift, was the place\nthrough which the Swine-things had made their exit, from some unholy\nplace in the bowels of the world. How near the probable truth this went,\nI was to learn later.\n\nIt may be easily understood, that I was tremendously curious, though in\na frightened way, to know to what infernal place that hole led; though,\nso far, the idea had not struck me, seriously, of making an\ninvestigation. I was far too much imbued with a sense of horror of the\nSwine-creatures, to think of venturing, willingly, where there was any\nchance of coming into contact with them.\n\nGradually, however, as time passed, this feeling grew insensibly less;\nso that when, a few days later, the thought occurred to me that it might\nbe possible to clamber down and have a look into the hole, I was not so\nexceedingly averse to it, as might have been imagined. Still, I do not\nthink, even then, that I really intended to try any such foolhardy\nadventure. For all that I could tell, it might be certain death, to\nenter that doleful looking opening. And yet, such is the pertinacity of\nhuman curiosity, that, at last, my chief desire was but to discover what\nlay beyond that gloomy entrance.\n\nSlowly, as the days slid by, my fear of the Swine-things became an\nemotion of the past--more an unpleasant, incredible memory, than\naught else.\n\nThus, a day came, when, throwing thoughts and fancies adrift, I\nprocured a rope from the house, and, having made it fast to a stout\ntree, at the top of the rift, and some little distance back from the Pit\nedge, let the other end down into the cleft, until it dangled right\nacross the mouth of the dark hole.\n\nThen, cautiously, and with many misgivings as to whether it was not a\nmad act that I was attempting, I climbed slowly down, using the rope as\na support, until I reached the hole. Here, still holding on to the rope,\nI stood, and peered in. All was perfectly dark, and not a sound came to\nme. Yet, a moment later, it seemed that I could hear something. I held\nmy breath, and listened; but all was silent as the grave, and I breathed\nfreely once more. At the same instant, I heard the sound again. It was\nlike a noise of labored breathing--deep and sharp-drawn. For a short\nsecond, I stood, petrified; not able to move. But now the sounds had\nceased again, and I could hear nothing.\n\nAs I stood there, anxiously, my foot dislodged a pebble, which fell\ninward, into the dark, with a hollow chink. At once, the noise was taken\nup and repeated a score of times; each succeeding echo being fainter,\nand seeming to travel away from me, as though into remote distance.\nThen, as the silence fell again, I heard that stealthy breathing. For\neach respiration I made, I could hear an answering breath. The sounds\nappeared to be coming nearer; and then, I heard several others; but\nfainter and more distant. Why I did not grip the rope, and spring up out\nof danger, I cannot say. It was as though I had been paralyzed. I broke\nout into a profuse sweat, and tried to moisten my lips with my tongue.\nMy throat had gone suddenly dry, and I coughed, huskily. It came back to\nme, in a dozen, horrible, throaty tones, mockingly. I peered,\nhelplessly, into the gloom; but still nothing showed. I had a strange,\nchoky sensation, and again I coughed, dryly. Again the echo took it up,\nrising and falling, grotesquely, and dying slowly into a\nmuffled silence.\n\nThen, suddenly, a thought came to me, and I held my breath. The other\nbreathing stopped. I breathed again, and, once more, it re-commenced.\nBut now, I no longer feared. I knew that the strange sounds were not\nmade by any lurking Swine-creature; but were simply the echo of my own\nrespirations.\n\nYet, I had received such a fright, that I was glad to scramble up the\nrift, and haul up the rope. I was far too shaken and nervous to think of\nentering that dark hole then, and so returned to the house. I felt more\nmyself next morning; but even then, I could not summon up sufficient\ncourage to explore the place.\n\nAll this time, the water in the Pit had been creeping slowly up, and\nnow stood but a little below the opening. At the rate at which it was\nrising, it would be level with the floor in less than another week; and\nI realized that, unless I carried out my investigations soon, I should\nprobably never do so at all; as the water would rise and rise, until the\nopening, itself, was submerged.\n\nIt may have been that this thought stirred me to act; but, whatever it\nwas, a couple of days later, saw me standing at the top of the cleft,\nfully equipped for the task.\n\nThis time, I was resolved to conquer my shirking, and go right through\nwith the matter. With this intention, I had brought, in addition to the\nrope, a bundle of candles, meaning to use them as a torch; also my\ndouble-barreled shotgun. In my belt, I had a heavy horse-pistol, loaded\nwith buckshot.\n\nAs before, I fastened the rope to the tree. Then, having tied my gun\nacross my shoulders, with a piece of stout cord, I lowered myself over\nthe edge of the Pit. At this movement, Pepper, who had been eyeing my\nactions, watchfully, rose to his feet, and ran to me, with a half bark,\nhalf wail, it seemed to me, of warning. But I was resolved on my\nenterprise, and bade him lie down. I would much have liked to take him\nwith me; but this was next to impossible, in the existing circumstances.\nAs my face dropped level with the Pit edge, he licked me, right across\nthe mouth; and then, seizing my sleeve between his teeth, began to pull\nback, strongly. It was very evident that he did not want me to go. Yet,\nhaving made up my mind, I had no intention of giving up the attempt;\nand, with a sharp word to Pepper, to release me, I continued my descent,\nleaving the poor old fellow at the top, barking and crying like a\nforsaken pup.\n\nCarefully, I lowered myself from projection to projection. I knew that\na slip might mean a wetting.\n\nReaching the entrance, I let go the rope, and untied the gun from my\nshoulders. Then, with a last look at the sky--which I noticed was\nclouding over, rapidly--I went forward a couple of paces, so as to be\nshielded from the wind, and lit one of the candles. Holding it above my\nhead, and grasping my gun, firmly, I began to move on, slowly, throwing\nmy glances in all directions.\n\nFor the first minute, I could hear the melancholy sound of Pepper's\nhowling, coming down to me. Gradually, as I penetrated further into the\ndarkness, it grew fainter; until, in a little while, I could hear\nnothing. The path tended downward somewhat, and to the left. Thence it\nkept on, still running to the left, until I found that it was leading me\nright in the direction of the house.\n\nVery cautiously, I moved onward, stopping, every few steps, to listen.\nI had gone, perhaps, a hundred yards, when, suddenly, it seemed to me\nthat I caught a faint sound, somewhere along the passage behind. With my\nheart thudding heavily, I listened. The noise grew plainer, and appeared\nto be approaching, rapidly. I could hear it distinctly, now. It was the\nsoft padding of running feet. In the first moments of fright, I stood,\nirresolute; not knowing whether to go forward or backward. Then, with a\nsudden realization of the best thing to do, I backed up to the rocky\nwall on my right, and, holding the candle above my head, waited--gun in\nhand--cursing my foolhardy curiosity, for bringing me into such\na strait.\n\nI had not long to wait, but a few seconds, before two eyes reflected\nback from the gloom, the rays of my candle. I raised my gun, using my\nright hand only, and aimed quickly. Even as I did so, something leapt\nout of the darkness, with a blustering bark of joy that woke the echoes,\nlike thunder. It was Pepper. How he had contrived to scramble down the\ncleft, I could not conceive. As I brushed my hand, nervously, over his\ncoat, I noticed that he was dripping; and concluded that he must have\ntried to follow me, and fallen into the water; from which he would not\nfind it very difficult to climb.\n\nHaving waited a minute, or so, to steady myself, I proceeded along the\nway, Pepper following, quietly. I was curiously glad to have the old\nfellow with me. He was company, and, somehow, with him at my heels, I\nwas less afraid. Also, I knew how quickly his keen ears would detect the\npresence of any unwelcome creature, should there be such, amid the\ndarkness that wrapped us.\n\nFor some minutes we went slowly along; the path still leading straight\ntoward the house. Soon, I concluded, we should be standing right beneath\nit, did the path but carry far enough. I led the way, cautiously, for\nanother fifty yards, or so. Then, I stopped, and held the light high;\nand reason enough I had to be thankful that I did so; for there, not\nthree paces forward, the path vanished, and, in place, showed a hollow\nblackness, that sent sudden fear through me.\n\nVery cautiously, I crept forward, and peered down; but could see\nnothing. Then, I crossed to the left of the passage, to see whether\nthere might be any continuation of the path. Here, right against the\nwall, I found that a narrow track, some three feet wide, led onward.\nCarefully, I stepped on to it; but had not gone far, before I regretted\nventuring thereon. For, after a few paces, the already narrow way,\nresolved itself into a mere ledge, with, on the one side the solid,\nunyielding rock, towering up, in a great wall, to the unseen roof, and,\non the other, that yawning chasm. I could not help reflecting how\nhelpless I was, should I be attacked there, with no room to turn, and\nwhere even the recoil of my weapon might be sufficient to drive me\nheadlong into the depths below.\n\nTo my great relief, a little further on, the track suddenly broadened\nout again to its original breadth. Gradually, as I went onward, I\nnoticed that the path trended steadily to the right, and so, after some\nminutes, I discovered that I was not going forward; but simply circling\nthe huge abyss. I had, evidently, come to the end of the great passage.\n\nFive minutes later, I stood on the spot from which I had started;\nhaving been completely 'round, what I guessed now to be a vast pit, the\nmouth of which must be at least a hundred yards across.\n\nFor some little time, I stood there, lost in perplexing thought. 'What\ndoes it all mean?' was the cry that had begun to reiterate through\nmy brain.\n\nA sudden idea struck me, and I searched 'round for a piece of stone.\nPresently, I found a bit of rock, about the size of a small loaf.\nSticking the candle upright in a crevice of the floor, I went back from\nthe edge, somewhat, and, taking a short run, launched the stone forward\ninto the chasm--my idea being to throw it far enough to keep it clear of\nthe sides. Then, I stooped forward, and listened; but, though I kept\nperfectly quiet, for at least a full minute, no sound came back to me\nfrom out of the dark.\n\nI knew, then, that the depth of the hole must be immense; for the\nstone, had it struck anything, was large enough to have set the echoes\nof that weird place, whispering for an indefinite period. Even as it\nwas, the cavern had given back the sounds of my footfalls,\nmultitudinously. The place was awesome, and I would willingly have\nretraced my steps, and left the mysteries of its solitudes unsolved;\nonly, to do so, meant admitting defeat.\n\nThen, a thought came, to try to get a view of the abyss. It occurred to\nme that, if I placed my candles 'round the edge of the hole, I should be\nable to get, at least, some dim sight of the place.\n\nI found, on counting, that I had brought fifteen candles, in the\nbundle--my first intention having been, as I have already said, to make\na torch of the lot. These, I proceeded to place 'round the Pit mouth,\nwith an interval of about twenty yards between each.\n\nHaving completed the circle, I stood in the passage, and endeavored to\nget an idea of how the place looked. But I discovered, immediately, that\nthey were totally insufficient for my purpose. They did little more than\nmake the gloom visible. One thing they did, however, and that was, they\nconfirmed my opinion of the size of the opening; and, although they\nshowed me nothing that I wanted to see; yet the contrast they afforded\nto the heavy darkness, pleased me, curiously. It was as though fifteen\ntiny stars shone through the subterranean night.\n\nThen, even as I stood, Pepper gave a sudden howl, that was taken up by\nthe echoes, and repeated with ghastly variations, dying away, slowly.\nWith a quick movement, I held aloft the one candle that I had kept, and\nglanced down at the dog; at the same moment, I seemed to hear a noise,\nlike a diabolical chuckle, rise up from the hitherto, silent depths of\nthe Pit. I started; then, I recollected that it was, probably, the echo\nof Pepper's howl.\n\nPepper had moved away from me, up the passage, a few steps; he was\nnosing along the rocky floor; and I thought I heard him lapping. I went\ntoward him, holding the candle low. As I moved, I heard my boot go sop,\nsop; and the light was reflected from something that glistened, and\ncrept past my feet, swiftly toward the Pit. I bent lower, and looked;\nthen gave vent to an expression of surprise. From somewhere, higher up\nthe path, a stream of water was running quickly in the direction of the\ngreat opening, and growing in size every second.\n\nAgain, Pepper gave vent to that deep-drawn howl, and, running at me,\nseized my coat, and attempted to drag me up the path toward the\nentrance. With a nervous gesture, I shook him off, and crossed quickly\nover to the left-hand wall. If anything were coming, I was going to have\nthe wall at my back.\n\nThen, as I stared anxiously up the pathway, my candle caught a gleam,\nfar up the passage. At the same moment, I became conscious of a\nmurmurous roar, that grew louder, and filled the whole cavern with\ndeafening sound. From the Pit, came a deep, hollow echo, like the sob of\na giant. Then, I had sprung to one side, on to the narrow ledge that ran\n'round the abyss, and, turning, saw a great wall of foam sweep past me,\nand leap tumultuously into the waiting chasm. A cloud of spray burst\nover me, extinguishing my candle, and wetting me to the skin. I still\nheld my gun. The three nearest candles went out; but the further ones\ngave only a short flicker. After the first rush, the flow of water eased\ndown to a steady stream, maybe a foot in depth; though I could not see\nthis, until I had procured one of the lighted candles, and, with it,\nstarted to reconnoiter. Pepper had, fortunately, followed me as I leapt\nfor the ledge, and now, very much subdued, kept close behind.\n\nA short examination showed me that the water reached right across the\npassage, and was running at a tremendous rate. Already, even as I stood\nthere, it had deepened. I could make only a guess at what had happened.\nEvidently, the water in the ravine had broken into the passage, by some\nmeans. If that were the case, it would go on increasing in volume, until\nI should find it impossible to leave the place. The thought was\nfrightening. It was evident that I must make my exit as hurriedly\nas possible.\n\nTaking my gun by the stock, I sounded the water. It was a little under\nknee-deep. The noise it made, plunging down into the Pit, was deafening.\nThen, with a call to Pepper, I stepped out into the flood, using the gun\nas a staff. Instantly, the water boiled up over my knees, and nearly to\nthe tops of my thighs, with the speed at which it was racing. For one\nshort moment, I nearly lost my footing; but the thought of what lay\nbehind, stimulated me to a fierce endeavor, and, step-by-step, I\nmade headway.\n\nOf Pepper, I knew nothing at first. I had all I could do to keep on my\nlegs; and was overjoyed, when he appeared beside me. He was wading\nmanfully along. He is a big dog, with longish thin legs, and I suppose\nthe water had less grasp on them, than upon mine. Anyway, he managed a\ngreat deal better than I did; going ahead of me, like a guide, and\nwittingly--or otherwise--helping, somewhat, to break the force of the\nwater. On we went, step by step, struggling and gasping, until somewhere\nabout a hundred yards had been safely traversed. Then, whether it was\nbecause I was taking less care, or that there was a slippery place on\nthe rocky floor, I cannot say; but, suddenly, I slipped, and fell on my\nface. Instantly, the water leapt over me in a cataract, hurling me down,\ntoward that bottomless hole, at a frightful speed. Frantically I\nstruggled; but it was impossible to get a footing. I was helpless,\ngasping and drowning. All at once, something gripped my coat, and\nbrought me to a standstill. It was Pepper. Missing me, he must have\nraced back, through the dark turmoil, to find me, and then caught, and\nheld me, until I was able to get to my feet.\n\nI have a dim recollection of having seen, momentarily, the gleams of\nseveral lights; but, of this, I have never been quite sure. If my\nimpressions are correct, I must have been washed down to the very brink\nof that awful chasm, before Pepper managed to bring me to a standstill.\nAnd the lights, of course, could only have been the distant flames of\nthe candles, I had left burning. But, as I have said, I am not by any\nmeans sure. My eyes were full of water, and I had been badly shaken.\n\nAnd there was I, without my helpful gun, without light, and sadly\nconfused, with the water deepening; depending solely upon my old friend\nPepper, to help me out of that hellish place.\n\nI was facing the torrent. Naturally, it was the only way in which I\ncould have sustained my position a moment; for even old Pepper could not\nhave held me long against that terrific strain, without assistance,\nhowever blind, from me.\n\nPerhaps a minute passed, during which it was touch and go with me;\nthen, gradually I re-commenced my tortuous way up the passage. And so\nbegan the grimmest fight with death, from which ever I hope to emerge\nvictorious. Slowly, furiously, almost hopelessly, I strove; and that\nfaithful Pepper led me, dragged me, upward and onward, until, at last,\nahead I saw a gleam of blessed light. It was the entrance. Only a few\nyards further, and I reached the opening, with the water surging and\nboiling hungrily around my loins.\n\nAnd now I understood the cause of the catastrophe. It was raining\nheavily, literally in torrents. The surface of the lake was level with\nthe bottom of the opening--nay! more than level, it was above it.\nEvidently, the rain had swollen the lake, and caused this premature\nrise; for, at the rate the ravine had been filling, it would not have\nreached the entrance for a couple more days.\n\nLuckily, the rope by which I had descended, was streaming into the\nopening, upon the inrushing waters. Seizing the end, I knotted it\nsecurely 'round Pepper's body, then, summoning up the last remnant of my\nstrength, I commenced to swarm up the side of the cliff. I reached the\nPit edge, in the last stage of exhaustion. Yet, I had to make one more\neffort, and haul Pepper into safety.\n\nSlowly and wearily, I hauled on the rope. Once or twice, it seemed that\nI should have to give up; for Pepper is a weighty dog, and I was utterly\ndone. Yet, to let go, would have meant certain death to the old fellow,\nand the thought spurred me to greater exertions. I have but a very hazy\nremembrance of the end. I recall pulling, through moments that lagged\nstrangely. I have also some recollection of seeing Pepper's muzzle,\nappearing over the Pit edge, after what seemed an indefinite period of\ntime. Then, all grew suddenly dark.\n\n\n\n_XIII_\n\nTHE TRAP IN THE GREAT CELLAR\n\nI suppose I must have swooned; for, the next thing I remember, I opened\nmy eyes, and all was dusk. I was lying on my back, with one leg doubled\nunder the other, and Pepper was licking my ears. I felt horribly stiff,\nand my leg was numb, from the knee, downward. For a few minutes, I lay\nthus, in a dazed condition; then, slowly, I struggled to a sitting\nposition, and looked about me.\n\nIt had stopped raining, but the trees still dripped, dismally. From the\nPit, came a continuous murmur of running water. I felt cold and shivery.\nMy clothes were sodden, and I ached all over. Very slowly, the life came\nback into my numbed leg, and, after a little, I essayed to stand up.\nThis, I managed, at the second attempt; but I was very tottery, and\npeculiarly weak. It seemed to me, that I was going to be ill, and I made\nshift to stumble my way toward the house. My steps were erratic, and my\nhead confused. At each step that I took, sharp pains shot through\nmy limbs.\n\nI had gone, perhaps, some thirty paces, when a cry from Pepper, drew\nmy attention, and I turned, stiffly, toward him. The old dog was trying\nto follow me; but could come no further, owing to the rope, with which I\nhad hauled him up, being still tied 'round his body, the other end not\nhaving been unfastened from the tree. For a moment, I fumbled with the\nknots, weakly; but they were wet and hard, and I could do nothing. Then,\nI remembered my knife, and, in a minute, the rope was cut.\n\nHow I reached the house, I scarcely know, and, of the days that\nfollowed, I remember still less. Of one thing, I am certain, that, had\nit not been for my sister's untiring love and nursing, I had not been\nwriting at this moment.\n\nWhen I recovered my senses, it was to find that I had been in bed for\nnearly two weeks. Yet another week passed, before I was strong enough to\ntotter out into the gardens. Even then, I was not able to walk so far as\nthe Pit. I would have liked to ask my sister, how high the water had\nrisen; but felt it was wiser not to mention the subject to her. Indeed,\nsince then, I have made a rule never to speak to her about the strange\nthings, that happen in this great, old house.\n\nIt was not until a couple of days later, that I managed to get across\nto the Pit. There, I found that, in my few weeks' absence, there had\nbeen wrought a wondrous change. Instead of the three-parts filled\nravine, I looked out upon a great lake, whose placid surface, reflected\nthe light, coldly. The water had risen to within half a dozen feet of\nthe Pit edge. Only in one part was the lake disturbed, and that was\nabove the place where, far down under the silent waters, yawned the\nentrance to the vast, underground Pit. Here, there was a continuous\nbubbling; and, occasionally, a curious sort of sobbing gurgle would find\nits way up from the depth. Beyond these, there was nothing to tell of\nthe things that were hidden beneath. As I stood there, it came to me\nhow wonderfully things had worked out. The entrance to the place whence\nthe Swine-creatures had come, was sealed up, by a power that made me\nfeel there was nothing more to fear from them. And yet, with the\nfeeling, there was a sensation that, now, I should never learn anything\nfurther, of the place from which those dreadful Things had come. It was\ncompletely shut off and concealed from human curiosity forever.\n\nStrange--in the knowledge of that underground hell-hole--how apposite\nhas been the naming of the Pit. One wonders how it originated, and when.\nNaturally, one concludes that the shape and depth of the ravine would\nsuggest the name 'Pit.' Yet, is it not possible that it has, all along,\nheld a deeper significance, a hint--could one but have guessed--of the\ngreater, more stupendous Pit that lies far down in the earth, beneath\nthis old house? Under this house! Even now, the idea is strange and\nterrible to me. For I have proved, beyond doubt, that the Pit yawns\nright below the house, which is evidently supported, somewhere above the\ncenter of it, upon a tremendous, arched roof, of solid rock.\n\nIt happened in this wise, that, having occasion to go down to the\ncellars, the thought occurred to me to pay a visit to the great vault,\nwhere the trap is situated; and see whether everything was as I had\nleft it.\n\nReaching the place, I walked slowly up the center, until I came to the\ntrap. There it was, with the stones piled upon it, just as I had seen it\nlast. I had a lantern with me, and the idea came to me, that now would\nbe a good time to investigate whatever lay under the great, oak slab.\nPlacing the lantern on the floor, I tumbled the stones off the trap,\nand, grasping the ring, pulled the door open. As I did so, the cellar\nbecame filled with the sound of a murmurous thunder, that rose from far\nbelow. At the same time, a damp wind blew up into my face, bringing\nwith it a load of fine spray. Therewith, I dropped the trap, hurriedly,\nwith a half frightened feeling of wonder.\n\nFor a moment, I stood puzzled. I was not particularly afraid. The\nhaunting fear of the Swine-things had left me, long ago; but I was\ncertainly nervous and astonished. Then, a sudden thought possessed me,\nand I raised the ponderous door, with a feeling of excitement. Leaving\nit standing upon its end, I seized the lantern, and, kneeling down,\nthrust it into the opening. As I did so, the moist wind and spray drove\nin my eyes, making me unable to see, for a few moments. Even when my\neyes were clear, I could distinguish nothing below me, save darkness,\nand whirling spray.\n\nSeeing that it was useless to expect to make out anything, with the\nlight so high, I felt in my pockets for a piece of twine, with which to\nlower it further into the opening. Even as I fumbled, the lantern\nslipped from my fingers, and hurtled down into the darkness. For a brief\ninstant, I watched its fall, and saw the light shine on a tumult of\nwhite foam, some eighty or a hundred feet below me. Then it was gone. My\nsudden surmise was correct, and now, I knew the cause of the wet and\nnoise. The great cellar was connected with the Pit, by means of the\ntrap, which opened right above it; and the moisture, was the spray,\nrising from the water, falling into the depths.\n\nIn an instant, I had an explanation of certain things, that had\nhitherto puzzled me. Now, I could understand why the noises--on the\nfirst night of the invasion--had seemed to rise directly from under my\nfeet. And the chuckle that had sounded when first I opened the trap!\nEvidently, some of the Swine-things must have been right beneath me.\n\nAnother thought struck me. Were the creatures all drowned? Would they\ndrown? I remembered how unable I had been to find any traces to show\nthat my shooting had been really fatal. Had they life, as we understand\nlife, or were they ghouls? These thoughts flashed through my brain, as I\nstood in the dark, searching my pockets for matches. I had the box in my\nhand now, and, striking a light, I stepped to the trap door, and closed\nit. Then, I piled the stones back upon it; after which, I made my way\nout from the cellars.\n\nAnd so, I suppose the water goes on, thundering down into that\nbottomless hell-pit. Sometimes, I have an inexplicable desire to go down\nto the great cellar, open the trap, and gaze into the impenetrable,\nspray-damp darkness. At times, the desire becomes almost overpowering,\nin its intensity. It is not mere curiosity, that prompts me; but more as\nthough some unexplained influence were at work. Still, I never go; and\nintend to fight down the strange longing, and crush it; even as I would\nthe unholy thought of self-destruction.\n\nThis idea of some intangible force being exerted, may seem reasonless.\nYet, my instinct warns me, that it is not so. In these things, reason\nseems to me less to be trusted than instinct.\n\nOne thought there is, in closing, that impresses itself upon me, with\never growing insistence. It is, that I live in a very strange house; a\nvery awful house. And I have begun to wonder whether I am doing wisely\nin staying here. Yet, if I left, where could I go, and still obtain the\nsolitude, and the sense of her presence,[1] that alone make my old\nlife bearable?\n\n\n\n_XIV_\n\nTHE SEA OF SLEEP\n\nFor a considerable period after the last incident which I have narrated\nin my diary, I had serious thoughts of leaving this house, and might\nhave done so; but for the great and wonderful thing, of which I am\nabout to write.\n\nHow well I was advised, in my heart, when I stayed on here--spite of\nthose visions and sights of unknown and unexplainable things; for, had I\nnot stayed, then I had not seen again the face of her I loved. Yes,\nthough few know it, none now save my sister Mary, I have loved and,\nah! me--lost.\n\nI would write down the story of those sweet, old days; but it would be\nlike the tearing of old wounds; yet, after that which has happened, what\nneed have I to care? For she has come to me out of the unknown.\nStrangely, she warned me; warned me passionately against this house;\nbegged me to leave it; but admitted, when I questioned her, that she\ncould not have come to me, had I been elsewhere. Yet, in spite of this,\nstill she warned me, earnestly; telling me that it was a place, long\nago given over to evil, and under the power of grim laws, of which none\nhere have knowledge. And I--I just asked her, again, whether she would\ncome to me elsewhere, and she could only stand, silent.\n\nIt was thus, that I came to the place of the Sea of Sleep--so she\ntermed it, in her dear speech with me. I had stayed up, in my study,\nreading; and must have dozed over the book. Suddenly, I awoke and sat\nupright, with a start. For a moment, I looked 'round, with a puzzled\nsense of something unusual. There was a misty look about the room,\ngiving a curious softness to each table and chair and furnishing.\n\nGradually, the mistiness increased; growing, as it were, out of\nnothing. Then, slowly, a soft, white light began to glow in the room.\nThe flames of the candles shone through it, palely. I looked from side\nto side, and found that I could still see each piece of furniture; but\nin a strangely unreal way, more as though the ghost of each table and\nchair had taken the place of the solid article.\n\nGradually, as I looked, I saw them fade and fade; until, slowly, they\nresolved into nothingness. Now, I looked again at the candles. They\nshone wanly, and, even as I watched, grew more unreal, and so vanished.\nThe room was filled, now, with a soft, yet luminous, white twilight,\nlike a gentle mist of light. Beyond this, I could see nothing. Even the\nwalls had vanished.\n\nPresently, I became conscious that a faint, continuous sound, pulsed\nthrough the silence that wrapped me. I listened intently. It grew more\ndistinct, until it appeared to me that I harked to the breathings of\nsome great sea. I cannot tell how long a space passed thus; but, after a\nwhile, it seemed that I could see through the mistiness; and, slowly, I\nbecame aware that I was standing upon the shore of an immense and silent\nsea. This shore was smooth and long, vanishing to right and left of me,\nin extreme distances. In front, swam a still immensity of sleeping\nocean. At times, it seemed to me that I caught a faint glimmer of light,\nunder its surface; but of this, I could not be sure. Behind me, rose up,\nto an extraordinary height, gaunt, black cliffs.\n\nOverhead, the sky was of a uniform cold grey color--the whole place\nbeing lit by a stupendous globe of pale fire, that swam a little above\nthe far horizon, and shed a foamlike light above the quiet waters.\n\nBeyond the gentle murmur of the sea, an intense stillness prevailed.\nFor a long while, I stayed there, looking out across its strangeness.\nThen, as I stared, it seemed that a bubble of white foam floated up out\nof the depths, and then, even now I know not how it was, I was looking\nupon, nay, looking _into_ the face of Her--aye! into her face--into her\nsoul; and she looked back at me, with such a commingling of joy and\nsadness, that I ran toward her, blindly; crying strangely to her, in a\nvery agony of remembrance, of terror, and of hope, to come to me. Yet,\nspite of my crying, she stayed out there upon the sea, and only shook\nher head, sorrowfully; but, in her eyes was the old earth-light of\ntenderness, that I had come to know, before all things, ere we\nwere parted.\n\n\"At her perverseness, I grew desperate, and essayed to wade out to her;\nyet, though I would, I could not. Something, some invisible barrier,\nheld me back, and I was fain to stay where I was, and cry out to her in\nthe fullness of my soul, 'O, my Darling, my Darling--' but could say no\nmore, for very intensity. And, at that, she came over, swiftly, and\ntouched me, and it was as though heaven had opened. Yet, when I reached\nout my hands to her, she put me from her with tenderly stern hands, and\nI was abashed--\"\n\n\n\nTHE FRAGMENTS[2]\n\n(_The legible portions of the mutilated leaves_.)\n\n... through tears ... noise of eternity in my ears, we parted ... She\nwhom I love. O, my God ...!\n\nI was a great time dazed, and then I was alone in the blackness of the\nnight. I knew that I journeyed back, once more, to the known universe.\nPresently, I emerged from that enormous darkness. I had come among the\nstars ... vast time ... the sun, far and remote.\n\nI entered into the gulf that separates our system from the outer suns.\nAs I sped across the dividing dark, I watched, steadily, the\never-growing brightness and size of our sun. Once, I glanced back to the\nstars, and saw them shift, as it were, in my wake, against the mighty\nbackground of night, so vast was the speed of my passing spirit.\n\nI drew nigher to our system, and now I could see the shine of Jupiter.\nLater, I distinguished the cold, blue gleam of the earthlight.... I had\na moment of bewilderment. All about the sun there seemed to be bright,\nobjects, moving in rapid orbits. Inward, nigh to the savage glory of the\nsun, there circled two darting points of light, and, further off, there\nflew a blue, shining speck, that I knew to be the earth. It circled the\nsun in a space that seemed to be no more than an earth-minute.\n\n... nearer with great speed. I saw the radiances of Jupiter and\nSaturn, spinning, with incredible swiftness, in huge orbits. And ever I\ndrew more nigh, and looked out upon this strange sight--the visible\ncircling of the planets about the mother sun. It was as though time had\nbeen annihilated for me; so that a year was no more to my unfleshed\nspirit, than is a moment to an earth-bound soul.\n\nThe speed of the planets, appeared to increase; and, presently, I was\nwatching the sun, all ringed about with hair-like circles of different\n fire--the paths of the planets, hurtling at mighty speed, about\nthe central flame....\n\n\"... the sun grew vast, as though it leapt to meet me.... And now I was\nwithin the circling of the outer planets, and flitting swiftly, toward\nthe place where the earth, glimmering through the blue splendor of its\norbit, as though a fiery mist, circled the sun at a monstrous\nspeed....\" [3]\n\n\n\n_XV_\n\nTHE NOISE IN THE NIGHT\n\nAnd now, I come to the strangest of all the strange happenings that\nhave befallen me in this house of mysteries. It occurred quite\nlately--within the month; and I have little doubt but that what I saw\nwas in reality the end of all things. However, to my story.\n\nI do not know how it is; but, up to the present, I have never been able\nto write these things down, directly they happened. It is as though I\nhave to wait a time, recovering my just balance, and digesting--as it\nwere--the things I have heard or seen. No doubt, this is as it should\nbe; for, by waiting, I see the incidents more truly, and write of them\nin a calmer and more judicial frame of mind. This by the way.\n\nIt is now the end of November. My story relates to what happened in the\nfirst week of the month.\n\nIt was night, about eleven o'clock. Pepper and I kept one another\ncompany in the study--that great, old room of mine, where I read and\nwork. I was reading, curiously enough, the Bible. I have begun, in these\nlater days, to take a growing interest in that great and ancient book.\nSuddenly, a distinct tremor shook the house, and there came a faint and\ndistant, whirring buzz, that grew rapidly into a far, muffled screaming.\nIt reminded me, in a queer, gigantic way, of the noise that a clock\nmakes, when the catch is released, and it is allowed to run down. The\nsound appeared to come from some remote height--somewhere up in the\nnight. There was no repetition of the shock. I looked across at Pepper.\nHe was sleeping peacefully.\n\nGradually, the whirring noise decreased, and there came a long silence.\n\nAll at once, a glow lit up the end window, which protrudes far out from\nthe side of the house, so that, from it, one may look both East and\nWest. I felt puzzled, and, after a moment's hesitation, walked across\nthe room, and pulled aside the blind. As I did so, I saw the Sun rise,\nfrom behind the horizon. It rose with a steady, perceptible movement. I\ncould see it travel upward. In a minute, it seemed, it had reached the\ntops of the trees, through which I had watched it. Up, up--It was broad\ndaylight now. Behind me, I was conscious of a sharp, mosquito-like\nbuzzing. I glanced 'round, and knew that it came from the clock. Even as\nI looked, it marked off an hour. The minute hand was moving 'round the\ndial, faster than an ordinary second-hand. The hour hand moved quickly\nfrom space to space. I had a numb sense of astonishment. A moment later,\nso it seemed, the two candles went out, almost together. I turned\nswiftly back to the window; for I had seen the shadow of the\nwindow-frames, traveling along the floor toward me, as though a great\nlamp had been carried up past the window.\n\nI saw now, that the sun had risen high into the heavens, and was still\nvisibly moving. It passed above the house, with an extraordinary sailing\nkind of motion. As the window came into shadow, I saw another\nextraordinary thing. The fine-weather clouds were not passing, easily,\nacross the sky--they were scampering, as though a hundred-mile-an-hour\nwind blew. As they passed, they changed their shapes a thousand times a\nminute, as though writhing with a strange life; and so were gone. And,\npresently, others came, and whisked away likewise.\n\nTo the West, I saw the sun, drop with an incredible, smooth, swift\nmotion. Eastward, the shadows of every seen thing crept toward the\ncoming greyness. And the movement of the shadows was visible to me--a\nstealthy, writhing creep of the shadows of the wind-stirred trees. It\nwas a strange sight.\n\nQuickly, the room began to darken. The sun slid down to the horizon,\nand seemed, as it were, to disappear from my sight, almost with a jerk.\nThrough the greyness of the swift evening, I saw the silver crescent of\nthe moon, falling out of the Southern sky, toward the West. The evening\nseemed to merge into an almost instant night. Above me, the many\nconstellations passed in a strange, 'noiseless' circling, Westward. The\nmoon fell through that last thousand fathoms of the night-gulf, and\nthere was only the starlight....\n\nAbout this time, the buzzing in the corner ceased; telling me that the\nclock had run down. A few minutes passed, and I saw the Eastward sky\nlighten. A grey, sullen morning spread through all the darkness, and hid\nthe march of the stars. Overhead, there moved, with a heavy, everlasting\nrolling, a vast, seamless sky of grey clouds--a cloud-sky that would\nhave seemed motionless, through all the length of an ordinary earth-day.\nThe sun was hidden from me; but, from moment to moment, the world would\nbrighten and darken, brighten and darken, beneath waves of subtle light\nand shadow....\n\nThe light shifted ever Westward, and the night fell upon the earth. A\nvast rain seemed to come with it, and a wind of a most extraordinary\nloudness--as though the howling of a nightlong gale, were packed into\nthe space of no more than a minute.\n\nThis noise passed, almost immediately, and the clouds broke; so that,\nonce more, I could see the sky. The stars were flying Westward, with\nastounding speed. It came to me now, for the first time, that, though\nthe noise of the wind had passed, yet a constant 'blurred' sound was in\nmy ears. Now that I noticed it, I was aware that it had been with me all\nthe time. It was the world-noise.\n\nAnd then, even as I grasped at so much comprehension, there came the\nEastward light. No more than a few heartbeats, and the sun rose,\nswiftly. Through the trees, I saw it, and then it was above the trees.\nUp--up, it soared and all the world was light. It passed, with a swift,\nsteady swing to its highest altitude, and fell thence, Westward. I saw\nthe day roll visibly over my head. A few light clouds flittered\nNorthward, and vanished. The sun went down with one swift, clear plunge,\nand there was about me, for a few seconds, the darker growing grey of\nthe gloaming.\n\nSouthward and Westward, the moon was sinking rapidly. The night had\ncome, already. A minute it seemed, and the moon fell those remaining\nfathoms of dark sky. Another minute, or so, and the Eastward sky glowed\nwith the coming dawn. The sun leapt upon me with a frightening\nabruptness, and soared ever more swiftly toward the zenith. Then,\nsuddenly, a fresh thing came to my sight. A black thundercloud rushed up\nout of the South, and seemed to leap all the arc of the sky, in a single\ninstant. As it came, I saw that its advancing edge flapped, like a\nmonstrous black cloth in the heaven, twirling and undulating rapidly,\nwith a horrid suggestiveness. In an instant, all the air was full of\nrain, and a hundred lightning flashes seemed to flood downward, as it\nwere in one great shower. In the same second of time, the world-noise\nwas drowned in the roar of the wind, and then my ears ached, under the\nstunning impact of the thunder.\n\nAnd, in the midst of this storm, the night came; and then, within the\nspace of another minute, the storm had passed, and there was only the\nconstant 'blur' of the world-noise on my hearing. Overhead, the stars\nwere sliding quickly Westward; and something, mayhaps the particular\nspeed to which they had attained, brought home to me, for the first\ntime, a keen realization of the knowledge that it was the world that\nrevolved. I seemed to see, suddenly, the world--a vast, dark\nmass--revolving visibly against the stars.\n\nThe dawn and the sun seemed to come together, so greatly had the speed\nof the world-revolution increased. The sun drove up, in one long, steady\ncurve; passed its highest point, and swept down into the Western sky,\nand disappeared. I was scarcely conscious of evening, so brief was it.\nThen I was watching the flying constellations, and the Westward\nhastening moon. In but a space of seconds, so it seemed, it was sliding\nswiftly downward through the night-blue, and then was gone. And, almost\ndirectly, came the morning.\n\nAnd now there seemed to come a strange acceleration. The sun made one\nclean, clear sweep through the sky, and disappeared behind the Westward\nhorizon, and the night came and went with a like haste.\n\nAs the succeeding day, opened and closed upon the world, I was aware of\na sweat of snow, suddenly upon the earth. The night came, and, almost\nimmediately, the day. In the brief leap of the sun, I saw that the snow\nhad vanished; and then, once more, it was night.\n\nThus matters were; and, even after the many incredible things that I\nhave seen, I experienced all the time a most profound awe. To see the\nsun rise and set, within a space of time to be measured by seconds; to\nwatch (after a little) the moon leap--a pale, and ever growing orb--up\ninto the night sky, and glide, with a strange swiftness, through the\nvast arc of blue; and, presently, to see the sun follow, springing out\nof the Eastern sky, as though in chase; and then again the night, with\nthe swift and ghostly passing of starry constellations, was all too much\nto view believingly. Yet, so it was--the day slipping from dawn to dusk,\nand the night sliding swiftly into day, ever rapidly and more rapidly.\n\nThe last three passages of the sun had shown me a snow-covered earth,\nwhich, at night, had seemed, for a few seconds, incredibly weird under\nthe fast-shifting light of the soaring and falling moon. Now, however,\nfor a little space, the sky was hidden, by a sea of swaying,\nleaden-white clouds, which lightened and blackened, alternately, with\nthe passage of day and night.\n\nThe clouds rippled and vanished, and there was once more before me, the\nvision of the swiftly leaping sun, and nights that came and went\nlike shadows.\n\nFaster and faster, spun the world. And now each day and night was\ncompleted within the space of but a few seconds; and still the speed\nincreased.\n\nIt was a little later, that I noticed that the sun had begun to have\nthe suspicion of a trail of fire behind it. This was due, evidently, to\nthe speed at which it, apparently, traversed the heavens. And, as the\ndays sped, each one quicker than the last, the sun began to assume the\nappearance of a vast, flaming comet[4] flaring across the sky at short,\nperiodic intervals. At night, the moon presented, with much greater\ntruth, a comet-like aspect; a pale, and singularly clear, fast traveling\nshape of fire, trailing streaks of cold flame. The stars showed now,\nmerely as fine hairs of fire against the dark.\n\nOnce, I turned from the window, and glanced at Pepper. In the flash of\na day, I saw that he slept, quietly, and I moved once more to\nmy watching.\n\nThe sun was now bursting up from the Eastern horizon, like a stupendous\nrocket, seeming to occupy no more than a second or two in hurling from\nEast to West. I could no longer perceive the passage of clouds across\nthe sky, which seemed to have darkened somewhat. The brief nights,\nappeared to have lost the proper darkness of night; so that the hair-like\nfire of the flying stars, showed but dimly. As the speed increased, the\nsun began to sway very slowly in the sky, from South to North, and then,\nslowly again, from North to South.\n\nSo, amid a strange confusion of mind, the hours passed.\n\nAll this while had Pepper slept. Presently, feeling lonely and\ndistraught, I called to him, softly; but he took no notice. Again, I\ncalled, raising my voice slightly; still he moved not. I walked over to\nwhere he lay, and touched him with my foot, to rouse him. At the action,\ngentle though it was, he fell to pieces. That is what happened; he\nliterally and actually crumbled into a mouldering heap of bones\nand dust.\n\nFor the space of, perhaps a minute, I stared down at the shapeless\nheap, that had once been Pepper. I stood, feeling stunned. What can have\nhappened? I asked myself; not at once grasping the grim significance of\nthat little hill of ash. Then, as I stirred the heap with my foot, it\noccurred to me that this could only happen in a great space of time.\nYears--and years.\n\nOutside, the weaving, fluttering light held the world. Inside, I stood,\ntrying to understand what it meant--what that little pile of dust and\ndry bones, on the carpet, meant. But I could not think, coherently.\n\nI glanced away, 'round the room, and now, for the first time, noticed\nhow dusty and old the place looked. Dust and dirt everywhere; piled in\nlittle heaps in the corners, and spread about upon the furniture. The\nvery carpet, itself, was invisible beneath a coating of the same, all\npervading, material. As I walked, little clouds of the stuff rose up\nfrom under my footsteps, and assailed my nostrils, with a dry, bitter\nodor that made me wheeze, huskily.\n\nSuddenly, as my glance fell again upon Pepper's remains, I stood still,\nand gave voice to my confusion--questioning, aloud, whether the years\nwere, indeed, passing; whether this, which I had taken to be a form of\nvision, was, in truth, a reality. I paused. A new thought had struck me.\nQuickly, but with steps which, for the first time, I noticed, tottered,\nI went across the room to the great pier-glass, and looked in. It was\ntoo covered with grime, to give back any reflection, and, with trembling\nhands, I began to rub off the dirt. Presently, I could see myself. The\nthought that had come to me, was confirmed. Instead of the great, hale\nman, who scarcely looked fifty, I was looking at a bent, decrepit man,\nwhose shoulders stooped, and whose face was wrinkled with the years of a\ncentury. The hair--which a few short hours ago had been nearly coal\nblack--was now silvery white. Only the eyes were bright. Gradually, I\ntraced, in that ancient man, a faint resemblance to my self of\nother days.\n\nI turned away, and tottered to the window. I knew, now, that I was old,\nand the knowledge seemed to confirm my trembling walk. For a little\nspace, I stared moodily out into the blurred vista of changeful\nlandscape. Even in that short time, a year passed, and, with a petulant\ngesture, I left the window. As I did so, I noticed that my hand shook\nwith the palsy of old age; and a short sob choked its way through\nmy lips.\n\nFor a little while, I paced, tremulously, between the window and the\ntable; my gaze wandering hither and thither, uneasily. How dilapidated\nthe room was. Everywhere lay the thick dust--thick, sleepy, and black.\nThe fender was a shape of rust. The chains that held the brass\nclock-weights, had rusted through long ago, and now the weights lay on\nthe floor beneath; themselves two cones of verdigris.\n\nAs I glanced about, it seemed to me that I could see the very furniture\nof the room rotting and decaying before my eyes. Nor was this fancy, on\nmy part; for, all at once, the bookshelf, along the sidewall, collapsed,\nwith a cracking and rending of rotten wood, precipitating its contents\nupon the floor, and filling the room with a smother of dusty atoms.\n\nHow tired I felt. As I walked, it seemed that I could hear my dry\njoints, creak and crack at every step. I wondered about my sister. Was\nshe dead, as well as Pepper? All had happened so quickly and suddenly.\nThis must be, indeed, the beginning of the end of all things! It\noccurred to me, to go to look for her; but I felt too weary. And then,\nshe had been so queer about these happenings, of late. Of late! I\nrepeated the words, and laughed, feebly--mirthlessly, as the realization\nwas borne in upon me that I spoke of a time, half a century gone. Half a\ncentury! It might have been twice as long!\n\nI moved slowly to the window, and looked out once more across the\nworld. I can best describe the passage of day and night, at this period,\nas a sort of gigantic, ponderous flicker. Moment by moment, the\nacceleration of time continued; so that, at nights now, I saw the moon,\nonly as a swaying trail of palish fire, that varied from a mere line of\nlight to a nebulous path, and then dwindled again, disappearing\nperiodically.\n\nThe flicker of the days and nights quickened. The days had grown\nperceptibly darker, and a queer quality of dusk lay, as it were, in the\natmosphere. The nights were so much lighter, that the stars were\nscarcely to be seen, saving here and there an occasional hair-like line\nof fire, that seemed to sway a little, with the moon.\n\nQuicker, and ever quicker, ran the flicker of day and night; and,\nsuddenly it seemed, I was aware that the flicker had died out, and,\ninstead, there reigned a comparatively steady light, which was shed upon\nall the world, from an eternal river of flame that swung up and down,\nNorth and South, in stupendous, mighty swings.\n\nThe sky was now grown very much darker, and there was in the blue of it\na heavy gloom, as though a vast blackness peered through it upon the\nearth. Yet, there was in it, also, a strange and awful clearness, and\nemptiness. Periodically, I had glimpses of a ghostly track of fire that\nswayed thin and darkly toward the sun-stream; vanished and reappeared.\nIt was the scarcely visible moon-stream.\n\nLooking out at the landscape, I was conscious again, of a blurring sort\nof 'flitter,' that came either from the light of the ponderous-swinging\nsun-stream, or was the result of the incredibly rapid changes of the\nearth's surface. And every few moments, so it seemed, the snow would lie\nsuddenly upon the world, and vanish as abruptly, as though an invisible\ngiant 'flitted' a white sheet off and on the earth.\n\nTime fled, and the weariness that was mine, grew insupportable. I\nturned from the window, and walked once across the room, the heavy dust\ndeadening the sound of my footsteps. Each step that I took, seemed a\ngreater effort than the one before. An intolerable ache, knew me in\nevery joint and limb, as I trod my way, with a weary uncertainty.\n\nBy the opposite wall, I came to a weak pause, and wondered, dimly, what\nwas my intent. I looked to my left, and saw my old chair. The thought of\nsitting in it brought a faint sense of comfort to my bewildered\nwretchedness. Yet, because I was so weary and old and tired, I would\nscarcely brace my mind to do anything but stand, and wish myself past\nthose few yards. I rocked, as I stood. The floor, even, seemed a place\nfor rest; but the dust lay so thick and sleepy and black. I turned, with\na great effort of will, and made toward my chair. I reached it, with a\ngroan of thankfulness. I sat down.\n\nEverything about me appeared to be growing dim. It was all so strange\nand unthought of. Last night, I was a comparatively strong, though\nelderly man; and now, only a few hours later--! I looked at the little\ndust-heap that had once been Pepper. Hours! and I laughed, a feeble,\nbitter laugh; a shrill, cackling laugh, that shocked my dimming senses.\n\nFor a while, I must have dozed. Then I opened my eyes, with a start.\nSomewhere across the room, there had been a muffled noise of something\nfalling. I looked, and saw, vaguely, a cloud of dust hovering above a\npile of _debris_. Nearer the door, something else tumbled, with a crash.\nIt was one of the cupboards; but I was tired, and took little notice. I\nclosed my eyes, and sat there in a state of drowsy, semi-unconsciousness.\nOnce or twice--as though coming through thick mists--I heard noises,\nfaintly. Then I must have slept.\n\n\n\n_XVI_\n\nTHE AWAKENING\n\nI awoke, with a start. For a moment, I wondered where I was. Then\nmemory came to me....\n\nThe room was still lit with that strange light--half-sun, half-moon,\nlight. I felt refreshed, and the tired, weary ache had left me. I went\nslowly across to the window, and looked out. Overhead, the river of\nflame drove up and down, North and South, in a dancing semi-circle of\nfire. As a mighty sleigh in the loom of time it seemed--in a sudden\nfancy of mine--to be beating home the picks of the years. For, so vastly\nhad the passage of time been accelerated, that there was no longer any\nsense of the sun passing from East to West. The only apparent movement\nwas the North and South beat of the sun-stream, that had become so swift\nnow, as to be better described as a _quiver_.\n\nAs I peered out, there came to me a sudden, inconsequent memory of that\nlast journey among the Outer worlds. I remembered the sudden vision that\nhad come to me, as I neared the Solar System, of the fast whirling\nplanets about the sun--as though the governing quality of time had been\nheld in abeyance, and the Machine of a Universe allowed to run down an\neternity, in a few moments or hours. The memory passed, along with a,\nbut partially comprehended, suggestion that I had been permitted a\nglimpse into further time spaces. I stared out again, seemingly, at the\nquake of the sun-stream. The speed seemed to increase, even as I looked.\nSeveral lifetimes came and went, as I watched.\n\nSuddenly, it struck me, with a sort of grotesque seriousness, that I\nwas still alive. I thought of Pepper, and wondered how it was that I had\nnot followed his fate. He had reached the time of his dying, and had\npassed, probably through sheer length of years. And here was I, alive,\nhundreds of thousands of centuries after my rightful period of years.\n\nFor, a time, I mused, absently. 'Yesterday--' I stopped, suddenly.\nYesterday! There was no yesterday. The yesterday of which I spoke had\nbeen swallowed up in the abyss of years, ages gone. I grew dazed with\nmuch thinking.\n\nPresently, I turned from the window, and glanced 'round the room. It\nseemed different--strangely, utterly different. Then, I knew what it was\nthat made it appear so strange. It was bare: there was not a piece of\nfurniture in the room; not even a solitary fitting of any sort.\nGradually, my amazement went, as I remembered, that this was but the\ninevitable end of that process of decay, which I had witnessed\ncommencing, before my sleep. Thousands of years! Millions of years!\n\nOver the floor was spread a deep layer of dust, that reached half way\nup to the window-seat. It had grown immeasurably, whilst I slept; and\nrepresented the dust of untold ages. Undoubtedly, atoms of the old,\ndecayed furniture helped to swell its bulk; and, somewhere among it all,\nmouldered the long-ago-dead Pepper.\n\nAll at once, it occurred to me, that I had no recollection of wading\nknee-deep through all that dust, after I awoke. True, an incredible age\nof years had passed, since I approached the window; but that was\nevidently as nothing, compared with the countless spaces of time that, I\nconceived, had vanished whilst I was sleeping. I remembered now, that I\nhad fallen asleep, sitting in my old chair. Had it gone ...? I glanced\ntoward where it had stood. Of course, there was no chair to be seen. I\ncould not satisfy myself, whether it had disappeared, after my waking,\nor before. If it had mouldered under me, surely, I should have been\nwaked by the collapse. Then I remembered that the thick dust, which\ncovered the floor, would have been sufficient to soften my fall; so that\nit was quite possible, I had slept upon the dust for a million years\nor more.\n\nAs these thoughts wandered through my brain, I glanced again, casually,\nto where the chair had stood. Then, for the first time, I noticed that\nthere were no marks, in the dust, of my footprints, between it and the\nwindow. But then, ages of years had passed, since I had awaked--tens of\nthousands of years!\n\nMy look rested thoughtfully, again upon the place where once had stood\nmy chair. Suddenly, I passed from abstraction to intentness; for there,\nin its standing place, I made out a long undulation, rounded off with\nthe heavy dust. Yet it was not so much hidden, but that I could tell\nwhat had caused it. I knew--and shivered at the knowledge--that it was a\nhuman body, ages-dead, lying there, beneath the place where I had slept.\nIt was lying on its right side, its back turned toward me. I could make\nout and trace each curve and outline, softened, and moulded, as it were,\nin the black dust. In a vague sort of way, I tried to account for its\npresence there. Slowly, I began to grow bewildered, as the thought came\nto me that it lay just about where I must have fallen when the chair\ncollapsed.\n\nGradually, an idea began to form itself within my brain; a thought that\nshook my spirit. It seemed hideous and insupportable; yet it grew upon\nme, steadily, until it became a conviction. The body under that coating,\nthat shroud of dust, was neither more nor less than my own dead shell. I\ndid not attempt to prove it. I knew it now, and wondered I had not known\nit all along. I was a bodiless thing.\n\nAwhile, I stood, trying to adjust my thoughts to this new problem. In\ntime--how many thousands of years, I know not--I attained to some degree\nof quietude--sufficient to enable me to pay attention to what was\ntranspiring around me.\n\nNow, I saw that the elongated mound had sunk, collapsed, level with the\nrest of the spreading dust. And fresh atoms, impalpable, had settled\nabove that mixture of grave-powder, which the aeons had ground. A long\nwhile, I stood, turned from the window. Gradually, I grew more\ncollected, while the world slipped across the centuries into the future.\n\nPresently, I began a survey of the room. Now, I saw that time was\nbeginning its destructive work, even on this strange old building. That\nit had stood through all the years was, it seemed to me, proof that it\nwas something different from any other house. I do not think, somehow,\nthat I had thought of its decaying. Though, why, I could not have said.\nIt was not until I had meditated upon the matter, for some considerable\ntime, that I fully realized that the extraordinary space of time through\nwhich it had stood, was sufficient to have utterly pulverized the very\nstones of which it was built, had they been taken from any earthly\nquarry. Yes, it was undoubtedly mouldering now. All the plaster had gone\nfrom the walls; even as the woodwork of the room had gone, many\nages before.\n\nWhile I stood, in contemplation, a piece of glass, from one of the\nsmall, diamond-shaped panes, dropped, with a dull tap, amid the dust\nupon the sill behind me, and crumbled into a little heap of powder. As I\nturned from contemplating it, I saw light between a couple of the stones\nthat formed the outer wall. Evidently, the mortar was falling away....\n\nAfter awhile, I turned once more to the window, and peered out. I\ndiscovered, now, that the speed of time had become enormous. The lateral\nquiver of the sun-stream, had grown so swift as to cause the dancing\nsemi-circle of flame to merge into, and disappear in, a sheet of fire\nthat covered half the Southern sky from East to West.\n\nFrom the sky, I glanced down to the gardens. They were just a blur of a\npalish, dirty green. I had a feeling that they stood higher, than in the\nold days; a feeling that they were nearer my window, as though they had\nrisen, bodily. Yet, they were still a long way below me; for the rock,\nover the mouth of the pit, on which this house stands, arches up to a\ngreat height.\n\nIt was later, that I noticed a change in the constant color of the\ngardens. The pale, dirty green was growing ever paler and paler, toward\nwhite. At last, after a great space, they became greyish-white, and\nstayed thus for a very long time. Finally, however, the greyness began\nto fade, even as had the green, into a dead white. And this remained,\nconstant and unchanged. And by this I knew that, at last, snow lay upon\nall the Northern world.\n\nAnd so, by millions of years, time winged onward through eternity, to\nthe end--the end, of which, in the old-earth days, I had thought\nremotely, and in hazily speculative fashion. And now, it was approaching\nin a manner of which none had ever dreamed.\n\nI recollect that, about this time, I began to have a lively, though\nmorbid, curiosity, as to what would happen when the end came--but I\nseemed strangely without imaginings.\n\nAll this while, the steady process of decay was continuing. The few\nremaining pieces of glass, had long ago vanished; and, every now and\nthen, a soft thud, and a little cloud of rising dust, would tell of some\nfragment of fallen mortar or stone.\n\nI looked up again, to the fiery sheet that quaked in the heavens above\nme and far down into the Southern sky. As I looked, the impression was\nborne in upon me, that it had lost some of its first brilliancy--that it\nwas duller, deeper hued.\n\nI glanced down, once more, to the blurred white of the worldscape.\nSometimes, my look returned to the burning sheet of dulling flame, that\nwas, and yet hid, the sun. At times, I glanced behind me, into the\ngrowing dusk of the great, silent room, with its aeon-carpet of\nsleeping dust....\n\nSo, I watched through the fleeting ages, lost in soul-wearing thoughts\nand wonderings, and possessed with a new weariness.\n\n\n\n_XVII_\n\nTHE SLOWING ROTATION\n\nIt might have been a million years later, that I perceived, beyond\npossibility of doubt, that the fiery sheet that lit the world, was\nindeed darkening.\n\nAnother vast space went by, and the whole enormous flame had sunk to a\ndeep, copper color. Gradually, it darkened, from copper to copper-red,\nand from this, at times, to a deep, heavy, purplish tint, with, in it, a\nstrange loom of blood.\n\nAlthough the light was decreasing, I could perceive no diminishment in\nthe apparent speed of the sun. It still spread itself in that dazzling\nveil of speed.\n\nThe world, so much of it as I could see, had assumed a dreadful shade\nof gloom, as though, in very deed, the last day of the worlds\napproached.\n\nThe sun was dying; of that there could be little doubt; and still the\nearth whirled onward, through space and all the aeons. At this time, I\nremember, an extraordinary sense of bewilderment took me. I found\nmyself, later, wandering, mentally, amid an odd chaos of fragmentary\nmodern theories and the old Biblical story of the world's ending.\n\nThen, for the first time, there flashed across me, the memory that the\nsun, with its system of planets, was, and had been, traveling through\nspace at an incredible speed. Abruptly, the question rose--_Where?_ For\na very great time, I pondered this matter; but, finally, with a certain\nsense of the futility of my puzzlings, I let my thoughts wander to other\nthings. I grew to wondering, how much longer the house would stand.\nAlso, I queried, to myself, whether I should be doomed to stay,\nbodiless, upon the earth, through the dark-time that I knew was coming.\nFrom these thoughts, I fell again to speculations upon the possible\ndirection of the sun's journey through space.... And so another great\nwhile passed.\n\nGradually, as time fled, I began to feel the chill of a great winter.\nThen, I remembered that, with the sun dying, the cold must be,\nnecessarily, extraordinarily intense. Slowly, slowly, as the aeons\nslipped into eternity, the earth sank into a heavier and redder gloom.\nThe dull flame in the firmament took on a deeper tint, very somber\nand turbid.\n\nThen, at last, it was borne upon me that there was a change. The fiery,\ngloomy curtain of flame that hung quaking overhead, and down away into\nthe Southern sky, began to thin and contract; and, in it, as one sees\nthe fast vibrations of a jarred harp-string, I saw once more the\nsun-stream quivering, giddily, North and South.\n\nSlowly, the likeness to a sheet of fire, disappeared, and I saw,\nplainly, the slowing beat of the sun-stream. Yet, even then, the speed\nof its swing was inconceivably swift. And all the time, the brightness\nof the fiery arc grew ever duller. Underneath, the world loomed\ndimly--an indistinct, ghostly region.\n\nOverhead, the river of flame swayed slower, and even slower; until, at\nlast, it swung to the North and South in great, ponderous beats, that\nlasted through seconds. A long space went by, and now each sway of the\ngreat belt lasted nigh a minute; so that, after a great while, I ceased\nto distinguish it as a visible movement; and the streaming fire ran in a\nsteady river of dull flame, across the deadly-looking sky.\n\nAn indefinite period passed, and it seemed that the arc of fire became\nless sharply defined. It appeared to me to grow more attenuated, and I\nthought blackish streaks showed, occasionally. Presently, as I watched,\nthe smooth onward-flow ceased; and I was able to perceive that there\ncame a momentary, but regular, darkening of the world. This grew until,\nonce more, night descended, in short, but periodic, intervals upon the\nwearying earth.\n\nLonger and longer became the nights, and the days equaled them; so\nthat, at last, the day and the night grew to the duration of seconds in\nlength, and the sun showed, once more, like an almost invisible,\ncoppery-red  ball, within the glowing mistiness of its flight.\nCorresponding to the dark lines, showing at times in its trail, there\nwere now distinctly to be seen on the half-visible sun itself, great,\ndark belts.\n\nYear after year flashed into the past, and the days and nights spread\ninto minutes. The sun had ceased to have the appearance of a tail; and\nnow rose and set--a tremendous globe of a glowing copper-bronze hue; in\nparts ringed with blood-red bands; in others, with the dusky ones, that\nI have already mentioned. These circles--both red and black--were of\nvarying thicknesses. For a time, I was at a loss to account for their\npresence. Then it occurred to me, that it was scarcely likely that the\nsun would cool evenly all over; and that these markings were due,\nprobably, to differences in temperature of the various areas; the red\nrepresenting those parts where the heat was still fervent, and the black\nthose portions which were already comparatively cool.\n\nIt struck me, as a peculiar thing, that the sun should cool in evenly\ndefined rings; until I remembered that, possibly, they were but isolated\npatches, to which the enormous rotatory speed of the sun had imparted a\nbelt-like appearance. The sun, itself, was very much greater than the sun\nI had known in the old-world days; and, from this, I argued that it was\nconsiderably nearer.\n\nAt nights, the moon[6] still showed; but small and remote; and the\nlight she reflected was so dull and weak that she seemed little more\nthan the small, dim ghost of the olden moon, that I had known.\n\nGradually, the days and nights lengthened out, until they equaled a\nspace somewhat less than one of the old-earth hours; the sun rising and\nsetting like a great, ruddy bronze disk, crossed with ink-black bars.\nAbout this time, I found myself, able once more, to see the gardens,\nwith clearness. For the world had now grown very still, and changeless.\nYet, I am not correct in saying, 'gardens'; for there were no\ngardens--nothing that I knew or recognized. In place thereof, I looked\nout upon a vast plain, stretching away into distance. A little to my\nleft, there was a low range of hills. Everywhere, there was a uniform,\nwhite covering of snow, in places rising into hummocks and ridges.\n\nIt was only now, that I recognized how really great had been the\nsnowfall. In places it was vastly deep, as was witnessed by a great,\nupleaping, wave-shaped hill, away to my right; though it is not\nimpossible, that this was due, in part, to some rise in the surface of\nthe ground. Strangely enough, the range of low hills to my\nleft--already mentioned--was not entirely covered with the universal\nsnow; instead, I could see their bare, dark sides showing in several\nplaces. And everywhere and always there reigned an incredible\ndeath-silence and desolation. The immutable, awful quiet of a\ndying world.\n\nAll this time, the days and nights were lengthening, perceptibly.\nAlready, each day occupied, maybe, some two hours from dawn to dusk. At\nnight, I had been surprised to find that there were very few stars\noverhead, and these small, though of an extraordinary brightness; which\nI attributed to the peculiar, but clear, blackness of the nighttime.\n\nAway to the North, I could discern a nebulous sort of mistiness; not\nunlike, in appearance, a small portion of the Milky Way. It might have\nbeen an extremely remote star-cluster; or--the thought came to me\nsuddenly--perhaps it was the sidereal universe that I had known, and now\nleft far behind, forever--a small, dimly glowing mist of stars, far in\nthe depths of space.\n\nStill, the days and nights lengthened, slowly. Each time, the sun rose\nduller than it had set. And the dark belts increased in breadth.\n\nAbout this time, there happened a fresh thing. The sun, earth, and sky\nwere suddenly darkened, and, apparently, blotted out for a brief space.\nI had a sense, a certain awareness (I could learn little by sight), that\nthe earth was enduring a very great fall of snow. Then, in an instant,\nthe veil that had obscured everything, vanished, and I looked out, once\nmore. A marvelous sight met my gaze. The hollow in which this house,\nwith its gardens, stands, was brimmed with snow.[7] It lipped over the\nsill of my window. Everywhere, it lay, a great level stretch of white,\nwhich caught and reflected, gloomily, the somber coppery glows of the\ndying sun. The world had become a shadowless plain, from horizon\nto horizon.\n\nI glanced up at the sun. It shone with an extraordinary, dull\nclearness. I saw it, now, as one who, until then, had seen it, only\nthrough a partially obscuring medium. All about it, the sky had become\nblack, with a clear, deep blackness, frightful in its nearness, and its\nunmeasured deep, and its utter unfriendliness. For a great time, I\nlooked into it, newly, and shaken and fearful. It was so near. Had I\nbeen a child, I might have expressed some of my sensation and distress,\nby saying that the sky had lost its roof.\n\nLater, I turned, and peered about me, into the room. Everywhere, it was\ncovered with a thin shroud of the all-pervading white. I could see it\nbut dimly, by reason of the somber light that now lit the world. It\nappeared to cling to the ruined walls; and the thick, soft dust of the\nyears, that covered the floor knee-deep, was nowhere visible. The snow\nmust have blown in through the open framework of the windows. Yet, in no\nplace had it drifted; but lay everywhere about the great, old room,\nsmooth and level. Moreover, there had been no wind these many thousand\nyears. But there was the snow,[8] as I have told.\n\nAnd all the earth was silent. And there was a cold, such as no living\nman can ever have known.\n\nThe earth was now illuminated, by day, with a most doleful light,\nbeyond my power to describe. It seemed as though I looked at the great\nplain, through the medium of a bronze-tinted sea.\n\nIt was evident that the earth's rotatory movement was departing,\nsteadily.\n\nThe end came, all at once. The night had been the longest yet; and\nwhen the dying sun showed, at last, above the world's edge, I had grown\nso wearied of the dark, that I greeted it as a friend. It rose steadily,\nuntil about twenty degrees above the horizon. Then, it stopped suddenly,\nand, after a strange retrograde movement, hung motionless--a great\nshield in the sky[9]. Only the circular rim of the sun showed\nbright--only this, and one thin streak of light near the equator.\n\nGradually, even this thread of light died out; and now, all that was\nleft of our great and glorious sun, was a vast dead disk, rimmed with a\nthin circle of bronze-red light.\n\n\n\n_XVIII_\n\nTHE GREEN STAR\n\nThe world was held in a savage gloom--cold and intolerable. Outside,\nall was quiet--quiet! From the dark room behind me, came the occasional,\nsoft thud[10] of falling matter--fragments of rotting stone. So time\npassed, and night grasped the world, wrapping it in wrappings of\nimpenetrable blackness.\n\nThere was no night-sky, as we know it. Even the few straggling stars\nhad vanished, conclusively. I might have been in a shuttered room,\nwithout a light; for all that I could see. Only, in the impalpableness\nof gloom, opposite, burnt that vast, encircling hair of dull fire.\nBeyond this, there was no ray in all the vastitude of night that\nsurrounded me; save that, far in the North, that soft, mistlike glow\nstill shone.\n\nSilently, years moved on. What period of time passed, I shall never\nknow. It seemed to me, waiting there, that eternities came and went,\nstealthily; and still I watched. I could see only the glow of the sun's\nedge, at times; for now, it had commenced to come and go--lighting up a\nwhile, and again becoming extinguished.\n\nAll at once, during one of these periods of life, a sudden flame cut\nacross the night--a quick glare that lit up the dead earth, shortly;\ngiving me a glimpse of its flat lonesomeness. The light appeared to come\nfrom the sun--shooting out from somewhere near its center, diagonally. A\nmoment, I gazed, startled. Then the leaping flame sank, and the gloom\nfell again. But now it was not so dark; and the sun was belted by a thin\nline of vivid, white light. I stared, intently. Had a volcano broken out\non the sun? Yet, I negatived the thought, as soon as formed. I felt that\nthe light had been far too intensely white, and large, for such a cause.\n\nAnother idea there was, that suggested itself to me. It was, that one\nof the inner planets had fallen into the sun--becoming incandescent,\nunder that impact. This theory appealed to me, as being more plausible,\nand accounting more satisfactorily for the extraordinary size and\nbrilliance of the blaze, that had lit up the dead world, so\nunexpectedly.\n\nFull of interest and emotion, I stared, across the darkness, at that\nline of white fire, cutting the night. One thing it told to me,\nunmistakably: the sun was yet rotating at an enormous speed.[11] Thus, I\nknew that the years were still fleeting at an incalculable rate; though\nso far as the earth was concerned, life, and light, and time, were\nthings belonging to a period lost in the long gone ages.\n\nAfter that one burst of flame, the light had shown, only as an\nencircling band of bright fire. Now, however, as I watched, it began\nslowly to sink into a ruddy tint, and, later, to a dark, copper-red\ncolor; much as the sun had done. Presently, it sank to a deeper hue;\nand, in a still further space of time, it began to fluctuate; having\nperiods of glowing, and anon, dying. Thus, after a great while, it\ndisappeared.\n\nLong before this, the smoldering edge of the sun had deadened into\nblackness. And so, in that supremely future time, the world, dark and\nintensely silent, rode on its gloomy orbit around the ponderous mass of\nthe dead sun.\n\nMy thoughts, at this period, can be scarcely described. At first, they\nwere chaotic and wanting in coherence. But, later, as the ages came and\nwent, my soul seemed to imbibe the very essence of the oppressive\nsolitude and dreariness, that held the earth.\n\nWith this feeling, there came a wonderful clearness of thought, and I\nrealized, despairingly, that the world might wander for ever, through\nthat enormous night. For a while, the unwholesome idea filled me, with a\nsensation of overbearing desolation; so that I could have cried like a\nchild. In time, however, this feeling grew, almost insensibly, less, and\nan unreasoning hope possessed me. Patiently, I waited.\n\nFrom time to time, the noise of dropping particles, behind in the room,\ncame dully to my ears. Once, I heard a loud crash, and turned,\ninstinctively, to look; forgetting, for the moment, the impenetrable\nnight in which every detail was submerged. In a while, my gaze sought\nthe heavens; turning, unconsciously, toward the North. Yes, the nebulous\nglow still showed. Indeed, I could have almost imagined that it looked\nsomewhat plainer. For a long time, I kept my gaze fixed upon it;\nfeeling, in my lonely soul, that its soft haze was, in some way, a tie\nwith the past. Strange, the trifles from which one can suck comfort! And\nyet, had I but known--But I shall come to that in its proper time.\n\nFor a very long space, I watched, without experiencing any of the\ndesire for sleep, that would so soon have visited me in the old-earth\ndays. How I should have welcomed it; if only to have passed the time,\naway from my perplexities and thoughts.\n\nSeveral times, the comfortless sound of some great piece of masonry\nfalling, disturbed my meditations; and, once, it seemed I could hear\nwhispering in the room, behind me. Yet it was utterly useless to try to\nsee anything. Such blackness, as existed, scarcely can be conceived. It\nwas palpable, and hideously brutal to the sense; as though something\ndead, pressed up against me--something soft, and icily cold.\n\nUnder all this, there grew up within my mind, a great and overwhelming\ndistress of uneasiness, that left me, but to drop me into an\nuncomfortable brooding. I felt that I must fight against it; and,\npresently, hoping to distract my thoughts, I turned to the window, and\nlooked up toward the North, in search of the nebulous whiteness, which,\nstill, I believed to be the far and misty glowing of the universe we had\nleft. Even as I raised my eyes, I was thrilled with a feeling of wonder;\nfor, now, the hazy light had resolved into a single, great star, of\nvivid green.\n\nAs I stared, astonished, the thought flashed into my mind; that the\nearth must be traveling toward the star; not away, as I had imagined.\nNext, that it could not be the universe the earth had left; but,\npossibly, an outlying star, belonging to some vast star-cluster, hidden\nin the enormous depths of space. With a sense of commingled awe and\ncuriosity, I watched it, wondering what new thing was to be revealed\nto me.\n\nFor a while, vague thoughts and speculations occupied me, during which\nmy gaze dwelt insatiably upon that one spot of light, in the otherwise\npitlike darkness. Hope grew up within me, banishing the oppression of\ndespair, that had seemed to stifle me. Wherever the earth was traveling,\nit was, at least, going once more toward the realms of light. Light! One\nmust spend an eternity wrapped in soundless night, to understand the\nfull horror of being without it.\n\nSlowly, but surely, the star grew upon my vision, until, in time, it\nshone as brightly as had the planet Jupiter, in the old-earth days. With\nincreased size, its color became more impressive; reminding me of a huge\nemerald, scintillating rays of fire across the world.\n\nYears fled away in silence, and the green star grew into a great splash\nof flame in the sky. A little later, I saw a thing that filled me with\namazement. It was the ghostly outline of a vast crescent, in the night;\na gigantic new moon, seeming to be growing out of the surrounding gloom.\nUtterly bemused, I stared at it. It appeared to be quite\nclose--comparatively; and I puzzled to understand how the earth had come\nso near to it, without my having seen it before.\n\nThe light, thrown by the star, grew stronger; and, presently, I was\naware that it was possible to see the earthscape again; though\nindistinctly. Awhile, I stared, trying to make out whether I could\ndistinguish any detail of the world's surface, but I found the light\ninsufficient. In a little, I gave up the attempt, and glanced once more\ntoward the star. Even in the short space, that my attention had been\ndiverted, it had increased considerably, and seemed now, to my\nbewildered sight, about a quarter of the size of the full moon. The\nlight it threw, was extraordinarily powerful; yet its color was so\nabominably unfamiliar, that such of the world as I could see, showed\nunreal; more as though I looked out upon a landscape of shadow, than\naught else.\n\nAll this time, the great crescent was increasing in brightness, and\nbegan, now, to shine with a perceptible shade of green. Steadily, the\nstar increased in size and brilliancy, until it showed, fully as large\nas half a full moon; and, as it grew greater and brighter, so did the\nvast crescent throw out more and more light, though of an ever deepening\nhue of green. Under the combined blaze of their radiances, the\nwilderness that stretched before me, became steadily more visible. Soon,\nI seemed able to stare across the whole world, which now appeared,\nbeneath the strange light, terrible in its cold and awful, flat\ndreariness.\n\nIt was a little later, that my attention was drawn to the fact, that\nthe great star of green flame, was slowly sinking out of the North,\ntoward the East. At first, I could scarcely believe that I saw aright;\nbut soon there could be no doubt that it was so. Gradually, it sank,\nand, as it fell, the vast crescent of glowing green, began to dwindle\nand dwindle, until it became a mere arc of light, against the livid\n sky. Later it vanished, disappearing in the self-same spot from\nwhich I had seen it slowly emerge.\n\nBy this time, the star had come to within some thirty degrees of the\nhidden horizon. In size it could now have rivaled the moon at its full;\nthough, even yet, I could not distinguish its disk. This fact led me to\nconceive that it was, still, an extraordinary distance away; and, this\nbeing so, I knew that its size must be huge, beyond the conception of\nman to understand or imagine.\n\nSuddenly, as I watched, the lower edge of the star vanished--cut by a\nstraight, dark line. A minute--or a century--passed, and it dipped\nlower, until the half of it had disappeared from sight. Far away out on\nthe great plain, I saw a monstrous shadow blotting it out, and advancing\nswiftly. Only a third of the star was visible now. Then, like a flash,\nthe solution of this extraordinary phenomenon revealed itself to me. The\nstar was sinking behind the enormous mass of the dead sun. Or rather,\nthe sun--obedient to its attraction--was rising toward it,[12] with the\nearth following in its trail. As these thoughts expanded in my mind, the\nstar vanished; being completely hidden by the tremendous bulk of the\nsun. Over the earth there fell, once more, the brooding night.\n\nWith the darkness, came an intolerable feeling of loneliness and dread.\nFor the first time, I thought of the Pit, and its inmates. After that,\nthere rose in my memory the still more terrible Thing, that had haunted\nthe shores of the Sea of Sleep, and lurked in the shadows of this old\nbuilding. Where were they? I wondered--and shivered with miserable\nthoughts. For a time, fear held me, and I prayed, wildly and\nincoherently, for some ray of light with which to dispel the cold\nblackness that enveloped the world.\n\nHow long I waited, it is impossible to say--certainly for a very great\nperiod. Then, all at once, I saw a loom of light shine out ahead.\nGradually, it became more distinct. Suddenly, a ray of vivid green,\nflashed across the darkness. At the same moment, I saw a thin line of\nlivid flame, far in the night. An instant, it seemed, and it had grown\ninto a great clot of fire; beneath which, the world lay bathed in a\nblaze of emerald green light. Steadily it grew, until, presently, the\nwhole of the green star had come into sight again. But now, it could be\nscarcely called a star; for it had increased to vast proportions, being\nincomparably greater than the sun had been in the olden time.\n\n\"Then, as I stared, I became aware that I could see the edge of the\nlifeless sun, glowing like a great crescent-moon. Slowly, its lighted\nsurface, broadened out to me, until half of its diameter was visible;\nand the star began to drop away on my right. Time passed, and the earth\nmoved on, slowly traversing the tremendous face of the dead sun.\" [13]\n\nGradually, as the earth traveled forward, the star fell still more to\nthe right; until, at last, it shone on the back of the house, sending a\nflood of broken rays, in through the skeleton-like walls. Glancing\nupward, I saw that much of the ceiling had vanished, enabling me to see\nthat the upper storeys were even more decayed. The roof had, evidently,\ngone entirely; and I could see the green effulgence of the Starlight\nshining in, slantingly.\n\n\n\n_XIX_\n\nTHE END OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM\n\nFrom the abutment, where once had been the windows, through which I had\nwatched that first, fatal dawn, I could see that the sun was hugely\ngreater, than it had been, when first the Star lit the world. So great\nwas it, that its lower edge seemed almost to touch the far horizon. Even\nas I watched, I imagined that it drew closer. The radiance of green that\nlit the frozen earth, grew steadily brighter.\n\nThus, for a long space, things were. Then, on a sudden, I saw that the\nsun was changing shape, and growing smaller, just as the moon would have\ndone in past time. In a while, only a third of the illuminated part was\nturned toward the earth. The Star bore away on the left.\n\nGradually, as the world moved on, the Star shone upon the front of the\nhouse, once more; while the sun showed, only as a great bow of green\nfire. An instant, it seemed, and the sun had vanished. The Star was\nstill fully visible. Then the earth moved into the black shadow of the\nsun, and all was night--Night, black, starless, and intolerable.\n\nFilled with tumultuous thoughts, I watched across the night--waiting.\nYears, it may have been, and then, in the dark house behind me, the\nclotted stillness of the world was broken. I seemed to hear a soft\npadding of many feet, and a faint, inarticulate whisper of sound, grew\non my sense. I looked 'round into the blackness, and saw a multitude of\neyes. As I stared, they increased, and appeared to come toward me. For\nan instant, I stood, unable to move. Then a hideous swine-noise[14] rose\nup into the night; and, at that, I leapt from the window, out on to the\nfrozen world. I have a confused notion of having run awhile; and, after\nthat, I just waited--waited. Several times, I heard shrieks; but always\nas though from a distance. Except for these sounds, I had no idea of the\nwhereabouts of the house. Time moved onward. I was conscious of little,\nsave a sensation of cold and hopelessness and fear.\n\nAn age, it seemed, and there came a glow, that told of the coming\nlight. It grew, tardily. Then--with a loom of unearthly glory--the first\nray from the Green Star, struck over the edge of the dark sun, and lit\nthe world. It fell upon a great, ruined structure, some two hundred\nyards away. It was the house. Staring, I saw a fearsome sight--over its\nwalls crawled a legion of unholy things, almost covering the old\nbuilding, from tottering towers to base. I could see them, plainly; they\nwere the Swine-creatures.\n\nThe world moved out into the light of the Star, and I saw that, now, it\nseemed to stretch across a quarter of the heavens. The glory of its\nlivid light was so tremendous, that it appeared to fill the sky with\nquivering flames. Then, I saw the sun. It was so close that half of its\ndiameter lay below the horizon; and, as the world circled across its\nface, it seemed to tower right up into the sky, a stupendous dome of\nemerald  fire. From time to time, I glanced toward the house; but\nthe Swine-things seemed unaware of my proximity.\n\nYears appeared to pass, slowly. The earth had almost reached the center\nof the sun's disk. The light from the Green _Sun_--as now it must be\ncalled--shone through the interstices, that gapped the mouldered walls\nof the old house, giving them the appearance of being wrapped in green\nflames. The Swine-creatures still crawled about the walls.\n\nSuddenly, there rose a loud roar of swine-voices, and, up from the\ncenter of the roofless house, shot a vast column of blood-red flame. I\nsaw the little, twisted towers and turrets flash into fire; yet still\npreserving their twisted crookedness. The beams of the Green Sun, beat\nupon the house, and intermingled with its lurid glows; so that it\nappeared a blazing furnace of red and green fire.\n\nFascinated, I watched, until an overwhelming sense of coming danger,\ndrew my attention. I glanced up, and, at once, it was borne upon me,\nthat the sun was closer; so close, in fact, that it seemed to overhang\nthe world. Then--I know not how--I was caught up into strange\nheights--floating like a bubble in the awful effulgence.\n\nFar below me, I saw the earth, with the burning house leaping into an\never growing mountain of flame, 'round about it, the ground appeared to\nbe glowing; and, in places, heavy wreaths of yellow smoke ascended from\nthe earth. It seemed as though the world were becoming ignited from that\none plague-spot of fire. Faintly, I could see the Swine-things. They\nappeared quite unharmed. Then the ground seemed to cave in, suddenly,\nand the house, with its load of foul creatures, disappeared into the\ndepths of the earth, sending a strange, blood  cloud into the\nheights. I remembered the hell Pit under the house.\n\nIn a while, I looked 'round. The huge bulk of the sun, rose high above\nme. The distance between it and the earth, grew rapidly less. Suddenly,\nthe earth appeared to shoot forward. In a moment, it had traversed the\nspace between it and the sun. I heard no sound; but, out from the sun's\nface, gushed an ever-growing tongue of dazzling flame. It seemed to\nleap, almost to the distant Green Sun--shearing through the emerald\nlight, a very cataract of blinding fire. It reached its limit, and sank;\nand, on the sun, glowed a vast splash of burning white--the grave of\nthe earth.\n\nThe sun was very close to me, now. Presently, I found that I was rising\nhigher; until, at last, I rode above it, in the emptiness. The Green Sun\nwas now so huge that its breadth seemed to fill up all the sky, ahead. I\nlooked down, and noted that the sun was passing directly beneath me.\n\nA year may have gone by--or a century--and I was left, suspended,\nalone. The sun showed far in front--a black, circular mass, against the\nmolten splendor of the great, Green Orb. Near one edge, I observed that\na lurid glow had appeared, marking the place where the earth had fallen.\nBy this, I knew that the long-dead sun was still revolving, though with\ngreat slowness.\n\nAfar to my right, I seemed to catch, at times, a faint glow of whitish\nlight. For a great time, I was uncertain whether to put this down to\nfancy or not. Thus, for a while, I stared, with fresh wonderings; until,\nat last, I knew that it was no imaginary thing; but a reality. It grew\nbrighter; and, presently, there slid out of the green, a pale globe of\nsoftest white. It came nearer, and I saw that it was apparently\nsurrounded by a robe of gently glowing clouds. Time passed....\n\nI glanced toward the diminishing sun. It showed, only as a dark blot on\nthe face of the Green Sun. As I watched, I saw it grow smaller,\nsteadily, as though rushing toward the superior orb, at an immense\nspeed. Intently, I stared. What would happen? I was conscious of\nextraordinary emotions, as I realized that it would strike the Green\nSun. It grew no bigger than a pea, and I looked, with my whole soul, to\nwitness the final end of our System--that system which had borne the\nworld through so many aeons, with its multitudinous sorrows and\njoys; and now--\n\nSuddenly, something crossed my vision, cutting from sight all vestige\nof the spectacle I watched with such soul-interest. What happened to the\ndead sun, I did not see; but I have no reason--in the light of that\nwhich I saw afterward--to disbelieve that it fell into the strange fire\nof the Green Sun, and so perished.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, an extraordinary question rose in my mind, whether\nthis stupendous globe of green fire might not be the vast Central\nSun--the great sun, 'round which our universe and countless others\nrevolve. I felt confused. I thought of the probable end of the dead sun,\nand another suggestion came, dumbly--Do the dead stars make the Green\nSun their grave? The idea appealed to me with no sense of grotesqueness;\nbut rather as something both possible and probable.\n\n\n\n_XX_\n\nTHE CELESTIAL GLOBES\n\nFor a while, many thoughts crowded my mind, so that I was unable to do\naught, save stare, blindly, before me. I seemed whelmed in a sea of\ndoubt and wonder and sorrowful remembrance.\n\nIt was later, that I came out of my bewilderment. I looked about,\ndazedly. Thus, I saw so extraordinary a sight that, for a while, I could\nscarcely believe I was not still wrapped in the visionary tumult of my\nown thoughts. Out of the reigning green, had grown a boundless river of\nsoftly shimmering globes--each one enfolded in a wondrous fleece of pure\ncloud. They reached, both above and below me, to an unknown distance;\nand, not only hid the shining of the Green Sun; but supplied, in place\nthereof, a tender glow of light, that suffused itself around me, like\nunto nothing I have ever seen, before or since.\n\nIn a little, I noticed that there was about these spheres, a sort of\ntransparency, almost as though they were formed of clouded crystal,\nwithin which burned a radiance--gentle and subdued. They moved on, past\nme, continually, floating onward at no great speed; but rather as\nthough they had eternity before them. A great while, I watched, and\ncould perceive no end to them. At times, I seemed to distinguish faces,\namid the cloudiness; but strangely indistinct, as though partly real,\nand partly formed of the mistiness through which they showed.\n\nFor a long time, I waited, passively, with a sense of growing content.\nI had no longer that feeling of unutterable loneliness; but felt,\nrather, that I was less alone, than I had been for kalpas of years. This\nfeeling of contentment, increased, so that I would have been satisfied\nto float in company with those celestial globules, forever.\n\nAges slipped by, and I saw the shadowy faces, with increased frequency,\nalso with greater plainness. Whether this was due to my soul having\nbecome more attuned to its surroundings, I cannot tell--probably it was\nso. But, however this may be, I am assured now, only of the fact that I\nbecame steadily more conscious of a new mystery about me, telling me\nthat I had, indeed, penetrated within the borderland of some\nunthought-of region--some subtle, intangible place, or form, of\nexistence.\n\nThe enormous stream of luminous spheres continued to pass me, at an\nunvarying rate--countless millions; and still they came, showing no\nsigns of ending, nor even diminishing.\n\nThen, as I was borne, silently, upon the unbuoying ether, I felt a\nsudden, irresistible, forward movement, toward one of the passing\nglobes. An instant, and I was beside it. Then, I slid through, into the\ninterior, without experiencing the least resistance, of any description.\nFor a short while, I could see nothing; and waited, curiously.\n\nAll at once, I became aware that a sound broke the inconceivable\nstillness. It was like the murmur of a great sea at calm--a sea\nbreathing in its sleep. Gradually, the mist that obscured my sight,\nbegan to thin away; and so, in time, my vision dwelt once again upon the\nsilent surface of the Sea of Sleep.\n\nFor a little, I gazed, and could scarcely believe I saw aright. I\nglanced 'round. There was the great globe of pale fire, swimming, as I\nhad seen it before, a short distance above the dim horizon. To my left,\nfar across the sea, I discovered, presently, a faint line, as of thin\nhaze, which I guessed to be the shore, where my Love and I had met,\nduring those wonderful periods of soul-wandering, that had been granted\nto me in the old earth days.\n\nAnother, a troubled, memory came to me--of the Formless Thing that had\nhaunted the shores of the Sea of Sleep. The guardian of that silent,\necholess place. These, and other, details, I remembered, and knew,\nwithout doubt that I was looking out upon that same sea. With the\nassurance, I was filled with an overwhelming feeling of surprise, and\njoy, and shaken expectancy, conceiving it possible that I was about to\nsee my Love, again. Intently, I gazed around; but could catch no sight\nof her. At that, for a little, I felt hopeless. Fervently, I prayed, and\never peered, anxiously.... How still was the sea!\n\nDown, far beneath me, I could see the many trails of changeful fire,\nthat had drawn my attention, formerly. Vaguely, I wondered what caused\nthem; also, I remembered that I had intended to ask my dear One about\nthem, as well as many other matters--and I had been forced to leave her,\nbefore the half that I had wished to say, was said.\n\nMy thoughts came back with a leap. I was conscious that something had\ntouched me. I turned quickly. God, Thou wert indeed gracious--it was\nShe! She looked up into my eyes, with an eager longing, and I looked\ndown to her, with all my soul. I should like to have held her; but the\nglorious purity of her face, kept me afar. Then, out of the winding\nmist, she put her dear arms. Her whisper came to me, soft as the rustle\nof a passing cloud. 'Dearest!' she said. That was all; but I had heard,\nand, in a moment I held her to me--as I prayed--forever.\n\nIn a little, she spoke of many things, and I listened. Willingly, would\nI have done so through all the ages that are to come. At times, I\nwhispered back, and my whispers brought to her spirit face, once more,\nan indescribably delicate tint--the bloom of love. Later, I spoke more\nfreely, and to each word she listened, and made answer, delightfully; so\nthat, already, I was in Paradise.\n\nShe and I; and nothing, save the silent, spacious void to see us; and\nonly the quiet waters of the Sea of Sleep to hear us.\n\nLong before, the floating multitude of cloud-enfolded spheres had\nvanished into nothingness. Thus, we looked upon the face of the\nslumberous deeps, and were alone. Alone, God, I would be thus alone in\nthe hereafter, and yet be never lonely! I had her, and, greater than\nthis, she had me. Aye, aeon-aged me; and on this thought, and some\nothers, I hope to exist through the few remaining years that may yet lie\nbetween us.\n\n\n\n_XXI_\n\nTHE DARK SUN\n\nHow long our souls lay in the arms of joy, I cannot say; but, all at\nonce, I was waked from my happiness, by a diminution of the pale and\ngentle light that lit the Sea of Sleep. I turned toward the huge, white\norb, with a premonition of coming trouble. One side of it was curving\ninward, as though a convex, black shadow were sweeping across it. My\nmemory went back. It was thus, that the darkness had come, before our\nlast parting. I turned toward my Love, inquiringly. With a sudden\nknowledge of woe, I noticed how wan and unreal she had grown, even in\nthat brief space. Her voice seemed to come to me from a distance. The\ntouch of her hands was no more than the gentle pressure of a summer\nwind, and grew less perceptible.\n\nAlready, quite half of the immense globe was shrouded. A feeling of\ndesperation seized me. Was she about to leave me? Would she have to go,\nas she had gone before? I questioned her, anxiously, frightenedly; and\nshe, nestling closer, explained, in that strange, faraway voice, that it\nwas imperative she should leave me, before the Sun of Darkness--as she\ntermed it--blotted out the light. At this confirmation of my fears, I\nwas overcome with despair; and could only look, voicelessly, across the\nquiet plains of the silent sea.\n\nHow swiftly the darkness spread across the face of the White Orb. Yet,\nin reality, the time must have been long, beyond human comprehension.\n\nAt last, only a crescent of pale fire, lit the, now dim, Sea of Sleep.\nAll this while, she had held me; but, with so soft a caress, that I had\nbeen scarcely conscious of it. We waited there, together, she and I;\nspeechless, for very sorrow. In the dimming light, her face showed,\nshadowy--blending into the dusky mistiness that encircled us.\n\nThen, when a thin, curved line of soft light was all that lit the sea,\nshe released me--pushing me from her, tenderly. Her voice sounded in my\nears, 'I may not stay longer, Dear One.' It ended in a sob.\n\nShe seemed to float away from me, and became invisible. Her voice came\nto me, out of the shadows, faintly; apparently from a great distance:--\n\n'A little while--' It died away, remotely. In a breath, the Sea of\nSleep darkened into night. Far to my left, I seemed to see, for a brief\ninstant, a soft glow. It vanished, and, in the same moment, I became\naware that I was no longer above the still sea; but once more suspended\nin infinite space, with the Green Sun--now eclipsed by a vast, dark\nsphere--before me.\n\nUtterly bewildered, I stared, almost unseeingly, at the ring of green\nflames, leaping above the dark edge. Even in the chaos of my thoughts, I\nwondered, dully, at their extraordinary shapes. A multitude of questions\nassailed me. I thought more of her, I had so lately seen, than of the\nsight before me. My grief, and thoughts of the future, filled me. Was I\ndoomed to be separated from her, always? Even in the old earth-days, she\nhad been mine, only for a little while; then she had left me, as I\nthought, forever. Since then, I had seen her but these times, upon the\nSea of Sleep.\n\nA feeling of fierce resentment filled me, and miserable questionings.\nWhy could I not have gone with my Love? What reason to keep us apart?\nWhy had I to wait alone, while she slumbered through the years, on the\nstill bosom of the Sea of Sleep? The Sea of Sleep! My thoughts turned,\ninconsequently, out of their channel of bitterness, to fresh, desperate\nquestionings. Where was it? Where was it? I seemed to have but just\nparted from my Love, upon its quiet surface, and it had gone, utterly.\nIt could not be far away! And the White Orb which I had seen hidden in\nthe shadow of the Sun of Darkness! My sight dwelt upon the Green\nSun--eclipsed. What had eclipsed it? Was there a vast, dead star\ncircling it? Was the _Central_ Sun--as I had come to regard it--a double\nstar? The thought had come, almost unbidden; yet why should it not\nbe so?\n\nMy thoughts went back to the White Orb. Strange, that it should have\nbeen--I stopped. An idea had come, suddenly. The White Orb and the Green\nSun! Were they one and the same? My imagination wandered backward, and I\nremembered the luminous globe to which I had been so unaccountably\nattracted. It was curious that I should have forgotten it, even\nmomentarily. Where were the others? I reverted again to the globe I had\nentered. I thought, for a time, and matters became clearer. I conceived\nthat, by entering that impalpable globule, I had passed, at once, into\nsome further, and, until then, invisible dimension; There, the Green Sun\nwas still visible; but as a stupendous sphere of pale, white\nlight--almost as though its ghost showed, and not its material part.\n\nA long time, I mused on the subject. I remembered how, on entering the\nsphere, I had, immediately, lost all sight of the others. For a still\nfurther period, I continued to revolve the different details in my mind.\n\nIn a while, my thoughts turned to other things. I came more into the\npresent, and began to look about me, seeingly. For the first time, I\nperceived that innumerable rays, of a subtle, violet hue, pierced the\nstrange semi-darkness, in all directions. They radiated from the fiery\nrim of the Green Sun. They seemed to grow upon my vision, so that, in a\nlittle, I saw that they were countless. The night was filled with\nthem--spreading outward from the Green Sun, fan-wise. I concluded that I\nwas enabled to see them, by reason of the Sun's glory being cut off by\nthe eclipse. They reached right out into space, and vanished.\n\nGradually, as I looked, I became aware that fine points of intensely\nbrilliant light, traversed the rays. Many of them seemed to travel from\nthe Green Sun, into distance. Others came out of the void, toward the\nSun; but one and all, each kept strictly to the ray in which it\ntraveled. Their speed was inconceivably great; and it was only when they\nneared the Green Sun, or as they left it, that I could see them as\nseparate specks of light. Further from the sun, they became thin lines\nof vivid fire within the violet.\n\nThe discovery of these rays, and the moving sparks, interested me,\nextraordinarily. To where did they lead, in such countless profusion? I\nthought of the worlds in space.... And those sparks! Messengers!\nPossibly, the idea was fantastic; but I was not conscious of its being\nso. Messengers! Messengers from the Central Sun!\n\nAn idea evolved itself, slowly. Was the Green Sun the abode of some\nvast Intelligence? The thought was bewildering. Visions of the Unnameable\nrose, vaguely. Had I, indeed, come upon the dwelling-place of the\nEternal? For a time, I repelled the thought, dumbly. It was too\nstupendous. Yet....\n\nHuge, vague thoughts had birth within me. I felt, suddenly, terribly\nnaked. And an awful Nearness, shook me.\n\nAnd Heaven ...! Was that an illusion?\n\nMy thoughts came and went, erratically. The Sea of Sleep--and she!\nHeaven.... I came back, with a bound, to the present. Somewhere, out of\nthe void behind me, there rushed an immense, dark body--huge and silent.\nIt was a dead star, hurling onward to the burying place of the stars. It\ndrove between me and the Central Suns--blotting them out from my vision,\nand plunging me into an impenetrable night.\n\nAn age, and I saw again the violet rays. A great while later--aeons it\nmust have been--a circular glow grew in the sky, ahead, and I saw the\nedge of the receding star, show darkly against it. Thus, I knew that it\nwas nearing the Central Suns. Presently, I saw the bright ring of the\nGreen Sun, show plainly against the night The star had passed into the\nshadow of the Dead Sun. After that, I just waited. The strange years\nwent slowly, and ever, I watched, intently.\n\n'The thing I had expected, came at last--suddenly, awfully. A vast\nflare of dazzling light. A streaming burst of white flame across the\ndark void. For an indefinite while, it soared outward--a gigantic\nmushroom of fire. It ceased to grow. Then, as time went by, it began to\nsink backward, slowly. I saw, now, that it came from a huge, glowing\nspot near the center of the Dark Sun. Mighty flames, still soared\noutward from this. Yet, spite of its size, the grave of the star was no\nmore than the shining of Jupiter upon the face of an ocean, when\ncompared with the inconceivable mass of the Dead Sun.\n\nI may remark here, once more, that no words will ever convey to the\nimagination, the enormous bulk of the two Central Suns.\n\n\n\n_XXII_\n\nTHE DARK NEBULA\n\nYears melted into the past, centuries, aeons. The light of the\nincandescent star, sank to a furious red.\n\nIt was later, that I saw the dark nebula--at first, an impalpable\ncloud, away to my right. It grew, steadily, to a clot of blackness in\nthe night. How long I watched, it is impossible to say; for time, as we\ncount it, was a thing of the past. It came closer, a shapeless\nmonstrosity of darkness--tremendous. It seemed to slip across the night,\nsleepily--a very hell-fog. Slowly, it slid nearer, and passed into the\nvoid, between me and the Central Suns. It was as though a curtain had\nbeen drawn before my vision. A strange tremor of fear took me, and a\nfresh sense of wonder.\n\nThe green twilight that had reigned for so many millions of years, had\nnow given place to impenetrable gloom. Motionless, I peered about me. A\ncentury fled, and it seemed to me that I detected occasional dull glows\nof red, passing me at intervals.\n\nEarnestly, I gazed, and, presently, seemed to see circular masses, that\nshowed muddily red, within the clouded blackness. They appeared to be\ngrowing out of the nebulous murk. Awhile, and they became plainer to my\naccustomed vision. I could see them, now, with a fair amount of\ndistinctness--ruddy-tinged spheres, similar, in size, to the luminous\nglobes that I had seen, so long previously.\n\nThey floated past me, continually. Gradually, a peculiar uneasiness\nseized me. I became aware of a growing feeling of repugnance and dread.\nIt was directed against those passing orbs, and seemed born of intuitive\nknowledge, rather than of any real cause or reason.\n\nSome of the passing globes were brighter than others; and, it was from\none of these, that a face looked, suddenly. A face, human in its\noutline; but so tortured with woe, that I stared, aghast. I had not\nthought there was such sorrow, as I saw there. I was conscious of an\nadded sense of pain, on perceiving that the eyes, which glared so\nwildly, were sightless. A while longer, I saw it; then it had passed on,\ninto the surrounding gloom. After this, I saw others--all wearing that\nlook of hopeless sorrow; and blind.\n\nA long time went by, and I became aware that I was nearer to the orbs,\nthan I had been. At this, I grew uneasy; though I was less in fear of\nthose strange globules, than I had been, before seeing their sorrowful\ninhabitants; for sympathy had tempered my fear.\n\nLater, there was no doubt but that I was being carried closer to the\nred spheres, and, presently, I floated among them. In awhile, I\nperceived one bearing down upon me. I was helpless to move from its\npath. In a minute, it seemed, it was upon me, and I was submerged in a\ndeep red mist. This cleared, and I stared, confusedly, across the\nimmense breadth of the Plain of Silence. It appeared just as I had first\nseen it. I was moving forward, steadily, across its surface. Away ahead,\nshone the vast, blood-red ring [15] that lit the place. All around, was\nspread the extraordinary desolation of stillness, that had so impressed\nme during my previous wanderings across its starkness.\n\nPresently, I saw, rising up into the ruddy gloom, the distant peaks of\nthe mighty amphitheatre of mountains, where, untold ages before, I had\nbeen shown my first glimpse of the terrors that underlie many things;\nand where, vast and silent, watched by a thousand mute gods, stands the\nreplica of this house of mysteries--this house that I had seen swallowed\nup in that hell-fire, ere the earth had kissed the sun, and vanished\nfor ever.\n\nThough I could see the crests of the mountain-amphitheatre, yet it was\na great while before their lower portions became visible. Possibly, this\nwas due to the strange, ruddy haze, that seemed to cling to the surface\nof the Plain. However, be this as it may, I saw them at last.\n\nIn a still further space of time, I had come so close to the mountains,\nthat they appeared to overhang me. Presently, I saw the great rift, open\nbefore me, and I drifted into it; without volition on my part.\n\nLater, I came out upon the breadth of the enormous arena. There, at an\napparent distance of some five miles, stood the House, huge, monstrous\nand silent--lying in the very center of that stupendous amphitheatre. So\nfar as I could see, it had not altered in any way; but looked as though\nit were only yesterday that I had seen it. Around, the grim, dark\nmountains frowned down upon me from their lofty silences.\n\nFar to my right, away up among inaccessible peaks, loomed the enormous\nbulk of the great Beast-god. Higher, I saw the hideous form of the dread\ngoddess, rising up through the red gloom, thousands of fathoms above\nme. To the left, I made out the monstrous Eyeless-Thing, grey and\ninscrutable. Further off, reclining on its lofty ledge, the livid\nGhoul-Shape showed--a splash of sinister color, among the dark\nmountains.\n\nSlowly, I moved out across the great arena--floating. As I went, I made\nout the dim forms of many of the other lurking Horrors that peopled\nthose supreme heights.\n\nGradually, I neared the House, and my thoughts flashed back across the\nabyss of years. I remembered the dread Specter of the Place. A short\nwhile passed, and I saw that I was being wafted directly toward the\nenormous mass of that silent building.\n\nAbout this time, I became aware, in an indifferent sort of way, of a\ngrowing sense of numbness, that robbed me of the fear, which I should\notherwise have felt, on approaching that awesome Pile. As it was, I\nviewed it, calmly--much as a man views calamity through the haze of his\ntobacco smoke.\n\nIn a little while, I had come so close to the House, as to be able to\ndistinguish many of the details about it. The longer I looked, the more\nwas I confirmed in my long-ago impressions of its entire similitude to\nthis strange house. Save in its enormous size, I could find\nnothing unlike.\n\nSuddenly, as I stared, a great feeling of amazement filled me. I had\ncome opposite to that part, where the outer door, leading into the\nstudy, is situated. There, lying right across the threshold, lay a great\nlength of coping stone, identical--save in size and color--with the\npiece I had dislodged in my fight with the Pit-creatures.\n\nI floated nearer, and my astonishment increased, as I noted that the\ndoor was broken partly from its hinges, precisely in the manner that my\nstudy door had been forced inward, by the assaults of the Swine-things.\nThe sight started a train of thoughts, and I began to trace, dimly,\nthat the attack on this house, might have a far deeper significance than\nI had, hitherto, imagined. I remembered how, long ago, in the old\nearth-days, I had half suspected that, in some unexplainable manner,\nthis house, in which I live, was _en rapport_--to use a recognized\nterm--with that other tremendous structure, away in the midst of that\nincomparable Plain.\n\nNow, however, it began to be borne upon me, that I had but vaguely\nconceived what the realization of my suspicion meant. I began to\nunderstand, with a more than human clearness, that the attack I had\nrepelled, was, in some extraordinary manner, connected with an attack\nupon that strange edifice.\n\nWith a curious inconsequence, my thoughts abruptly left the matter; to\ndwell, wonderingly, upon the peculiar material, out of which the House\nwas constructed. It was--as I have mentioned, earlier--of a deep, green\ncolor. Yet, now that I had come so close to it, I perceived that it\nfluctuated at times, though slightly--glowing and fading, much as do the\nfumes of phosphorus, when rubbed upon the hand, in the dark.\n\nPresently, my attention was distracted from this, by coming to the\ngreat entrance. Here, for the first time, I was afraid; for, all in a\nmoment, the huge doors swung back, and I drifted in between them,\nhelplessly. Inside, all was blackness, impalpable. In an instant, I had\ncrossed the threshold, and the great doors closed, silently, shutting me\nin that lightless place.\n\nFor a while, I seemed to hang, motionless; suspended amid the darkness.\nThen, I became conscious that I was moving again; where, I could not\ntell. Suddenly, far down beneath me, I seemed to hear a murmurous noise\nof Swine-laughter. It sank away, and the succeeding silence appeared\nclogged with horror.\n\nThen a door opened somewhere ahead; a white haze of light filtered\nthrough, and I floated slowly into a room, that seemed strangely\nfamiliar. All at once, there came a bewildering, screaming noise, that\ndeafened me. I saw a blurred vista of visions, flaming before my sight.\nMy senses were dazed, through the space of an eternal moment. Then, my\npower of seeing, came back to me. The dizzy, hazy feeling passed, and I\nsaw, clearly.\n\n\n\n_XXIII_\n\nPEPPER\n\nI was seated in my chair, back again in this old study. My glance\nwandered 'round the room. For a minute, it had a strange, quivery\nappearance--unreal and unsubstantial. This disappeared, and I saw that\nnothing was altered in any way. I looked toward the end window--the\nblind was up.\n\nI rose to my feet, shakily. As I did so, a slight noise, in the\ndirection of the door, attracted my attention. I glanced toward it. For\na short instant, it appeared to me that it was being closed, gently. I\nstared, and saw that I must have been mistaken--it seemed closely shut.\n\nWith a succession of efforts, I trod my way to the window, and looked\nout. The sun was just rising, lighting up the tangled wilderness of\ngardens. For, perhaps, a minute, I stood, and stared. I passed my hand,\nconfusedly, across my forehead.\n\nPresently, amid the chaos of my senses, a sudden thought came to me; I\nturned, quickly, and called to Pepper. There was no answer, and I\nstumbled across the room, in a quick access of fear. As I went, I tried\nto frame his name; but my lips were numb. I reached the table, and\nstooped down to him, with a catching at my heart. He was lying in the\nshadow of the table, and I had not been able to see him, distinctly,\nfrom the window. Now, as I stooped, I took my breath, shortly. There was\nno Pepper; instead, I was reaching toward an elongated, little heap of\ngrey, ashlike dust....\n\nI must have remained, in that half-stooped position, for some minutes.\nI was dazed--stunned. Pepper had really passed into the land of shadows.\n\n\n\n_XXIV_\n\nTHE FOOTSTEPS IN THE GARDEN\n\nPepper is dead! Even now, at times, I seem scarcely able to realize\nthat this is so. It is many weeks, since I came back from that strange\nand terrible journey through space and time. Sometimes, in my sleep, I\ndream about it, and go through, in imagination, the whole of that\nfearsome happening. When I wake, my thoughts dwell upon it. That\nSun--those Suns, were they indeed the great Central Suns, 'round which\nthe whole universe, of the unknown heavens, revolves? Who shall say? And\nthe bright globules, floating forever in the light of the Green Sun! And\nthe Sea of Sleep on which they float! How unbelievable it all is. If it\nwere not for Pepper, I should, even after the many extraordinary things\nthat I have witnessed, be inclined to imagine that it was but a gigantic\ndream. Then, there is that dreadful, dark nebula (with its multitudes of\nred spheres) moving always within the shadow of the Dark Sun, sweeping\nalong on its stupendous orbit, wrapped eternally in gloom. And the faces\nthat peered out at me! God, do they, and does such a thing really\nexist? ... There is still that little heap of grey ash, on my study\nfloor. I will not have it touched.\n\nAt times, when I am calmer, I have wondered what became of the outer\nplanets of the Solar System. It has occurred to me, that they may have\nbroken loose from the sun's attraction, and whirled away into space.\nThis is, of course, only a surmise. There are so many things, about\nwhich I wonder.\n\nNow that I am writing, let me record that I am certain, there is\nsomething horrible about to happen. Last night, a thing occurred, which\nhas filled me with an even greater terror, than did the Pit fear. I will\nwrite it down now, and, if anything more happens, endeavor to make a\nnote of it, at once. I have a feeling, that there is more in this last\naffair, than in all those others. I am shaky and nervous, even now, as I\nwrite. Somehow, I think death is not very far away. Not that I fear\ndeath--as death is understood. Yet, there is that in the air, which bids\nme fear--an intangible, cold horror. I felt it last night. It\nwas thus:--\n\nLast night, I was sitting here in my study, writing. The door, leading\ninto the garden, was half open. At times, the metallic rattle of a dog's\nchain, sounded faintly. It belongs to the dog I have bought, since\nPepper's death. I will not have him in the house--not after Pepper.\nStill, I have felt it better to have a dog about the place. They are\nwonderful creatures.\n\nI was much engrossed in my work, and the time passed, quickly.\nSuddenly, I heard a soft noise on the path, outside in the garden--pad,\npad, pad, it went, with a stealthy, curious sound. I sat upright, with a\nquick movement, and looked out through the opened door. Again the noise\ncame--pad, pad, pad. It appeared to be approaching. With a slight\nfeeling of nervousness, I stared into the gardens; but the night hid\neverything.\n\nThen the dog gave a long howl, and I started. For a minute, perhaps, I\npeered, intently; but could hear nothing. After a little, I picked up\nthe pen, which I had laid down, and recommenced my work. The nervous\nfeeling had gone; for I imagined that the sound I had heard, was nothing\nmore than the dog walking 'round his kennel, at the length of his chain.\n\nA quarter of an hour may have passed; then, all at once, the dog howled\nagain, and with such a plaintively sorrowful note, that I jumped to my\nfeet, dropping my pen, and inking the page on which I was at work.\n\n'Curse that dog!' I muttered, noting what I had done. Then, even as I\nsaid the words, there sounded again that queer--pad, pad, pad. It was\nhorribly close--almost by the door, I thought. I knew, now, that it\ncould not be the dog; his chain would not allow him to come so near.\n\nThe dog's growl came again, and I noted, subconsciously, the taint of\nfear in it.\n\nOutside, on the windowsill, I could see Tip, my sister's pet cat. As I\nlooked, it sprang to its feet, its tail swelling, visibly. For an\ninstant it stood thus; seeming to stare, fixedly, at something, in the\ndirection of the door. Then, quickly, it began to back along the sill;\nuntil, reaching the wall at the end, it could go no further. There it\nstood, rigid, as though frozen in an attitude of extraordinary terror.\n\nFrightened, and puzzled, I seized a stick from the corner, and went\ntoward the door, silently; taking one of the candles with me. I had come\nto within a few paces of it, when, suddenly, a peculiar sense of fear\nthrilled through me--a fear, palpitant and real; whence, I knew not, nor\nwhy. So great was the feeling of terror, that I wasted no time; but\nretreated straight-way--walking backward, and keeping my gaze,\nfearfully, on the door. I would have given much, to rush at it, fling it\nto, and shoot the bolts; for I have had it repaired and strengthened,\nso that, now, it is far stronger than ever it has been. Like Tip, I\ncontinued my, almost unconscious, progress backward, until the wall\nbrought me up. At that, I started, nervously, and glanced 'round,\napprehensively. As I did so, my eyes dwelt, momentarily, on the rack of\nfirearms, and I took a step toward them; but stopped, with a curious\nfeeling that they would be needless. Outside, in the gardens, the dog\nmoaned, strangely.\n\nSuddenly, from the cat, there came a fierce, long screech. I glanced,\njerkily, in its direction--Something, luminous and ghostly, encircled\nit, and grew upon my vision. It resolved into a glowing hand,\ntransparent, with a lambent, greenish flame flickering over it. The cat\ngave a last, awful caterwaul, and I saw it smoke and blaze. My breath\ncame with a gasp, and I leant against the wall. Over that part of the\nwindow there spread a smudge, green and fantastic. It hid the thing from\nme, though the glare of fire shone through, dully. A stench of burning,\nstole into the room.\n\nPad, pad, pad--Something passed down the garden path, and a faint,\nmouldy odor seemed to come in through the open door, and mingle with the\nburnt smell.\n\nThe dog had been silent for a few moments. Now, I heard him yowl,\nsharply, as though in pain. Then, he was quiet, save for an occasional,\nsubdued whimper of fear.\n\nA minute went by; then the gate on the West side of the gardens,\nslammed, distantly. After that, nothing; not even the dog's whine.\n\nI must have stood there some minutes. Then a fragment of courage stole\ninto my heart, and I made a frightened rush at the door, dashed it to,\nand bolted it. After that, for a full half-hour, I sat,\nhelpless--staring before me, rigidly.\n\nSlowly, my life came back into me, and I made my way, shakily,\nup-stairs to bed.\n\nThat is all.\n\n\n\n_XXV_\n\nTHE THING FROM THE ARENA\n\nThis morning, early, I went through the gardens; but found everything\nas usual. Near the door, I examined the path, for footprints; yet, here\nagain, there was nothing to tell me whether, or not, I dreamed\nlast night.\n\nIt was only when I came to speak to the dog, that I discovered tangible\nproof, that something did happen. When I went to his kennel, he kept\ninside, crouching up in one corner, and I had to coax him, to get him\nout. When, finally, he consented to come, it was in a strangely cowed\nand subdued manner. As I patted him, my attention was attracted to a\ngreenish patch, on his left flank. On examining it, I found, that the\nfur and skin had been apparently, burnt off; for the flesh showed, raw\nand scorched. The shape of the mark was curious, reminding me of the\nimprint of a large talon or hand.\n\nI stood up, thoughtful. My gaze wandered toward the study window. The\nrays of the rising sun, shimmered on the smoky patch in the lower\ncorner, causing it to fluctuate from green to red, oddly. Ah! that was\nundoubtedly another proof; and, suddenly, the horrible Thing I saw last\nnight, rose in my mind. I looked at the dog, again. I knew the cause,\nnow, of that hateful looking wound on his side--I knew, also, that, what\nI had seen last night, had been a real happening. And a great discomfort\nfilled me. Pepper! Tip! And now this poor animal ...! I glanced at the\ndog again, and noticed that he was licking at his wound.\n\n'Poor brute!' I muttered, and bent to pat his head. At that, he got\nupon his feet, nosing and licking my hand, wistfully.\n\nPresently, I left him, having other matters to which to attend.\n\nAfter dinner, I went to see him, again. He seemed quiet, and\ndisinclined to leave his kennel. From my sister, I have learnt that he\nhas refused all food today. She appeared a little puzzled, when she told\nme; though quite unsuspicious of anything of which to be afraid.\n\nThe day has passed, uneventfully enough. After tea, I went, again, to\nhave a look at the dog. He seemed moody, and somewhat restless; yet\npersisted in remaining in his kennel. Before locking up, for the night,\nI moved his kennel out, away from the wall, so that I shall be able to\nwatch it from the small window, tonight. The thought came to me, to\nbring him into the house for the night; but consideration has decided\nme, to let him remain out. I cannot say that the house is, in any\ndegree, less to be feared than the gardens. Pepper was in the house,\nand yet....\n\nIt is now two o'clock. Since eight, I have watched the kennel, from the\nsmall, side window in my study. Yet, nothing has occurred, and I am too\ntired to watch longer. I will go to bed....\n\nDuring the night, I was restless. This is unusual for me; but, toward\nmorning, I obtained a few hours' sleep.\n\nI rose early, and, after breakfast, visited the dog. He was quiet; but\nmorose, and refused to leave his kennel. I wish there was some horse\ndoctor near here; I would have the poor brute looked to. All day, he has\ntaken no food; but has shown an evident desire for water--lapping it up,\ngreedily. I was relieved to observe this.\n\nThe evening has come, and I am in my study. I intend to follow my plan\nof last night, and watch the kennel. The door, leading into the garden,\nis bolted, securely. I am consciously glad there are bars to the\nwindows....\n\nNight:--Midnight has gone. The dog has been silent, up to the present.\nThrough the side window, on my left, I can make out, dimly, the outlines\nof the kennel. For the first time, the dog moves, and I hear the rattle\nof his chain. I look out, quickly. As I stare, the dog moves again,\nrestlessly, and I see a small patch of luminous light, shine from the\ninterior of the kennel. It vanishes; then the dog stirs again, and, once\nmore, the gleam comes. I am puzzled. The dog is quiet, and I can see the\nluminous thing, plainly. It shows distinctly. There is something\nfamiliar about the shape of it. For a moment, I wonder; then it comes to\nme, that it is not unlike the four fingers and thumb of a hand. Like a\nhand! And I remember the contour of that fearsome wound on the dog's\nside. It must be the wound I see. It is luminous at night--Why? The\nminutes pass. My mind is filled with this fresh thing....\n\nSuddenly, I hear a sound, out in the gardens. How it thrills through\nme. It is approaching. Pad, pad, pad. A prickly sensation traverses my\nspine, and seems to creep across my scalp. The dog moves in his kennel,\nand whimpers, frightenedly. He must have turned 'round; for, now, I can\nno longer see the outline of his shining wound.\n\nOutside, the gardens are silent, once more, and I listen, fearfully. A\nminute passes, and another; then I hear the padding sound, again. It is\nquite close, and appears to be coming down the graveled path. The noise\nis curiously measured and deliberate. It ceases outside the door; and I\nrise to my feet, and stand motionless. From the door, comes a slight\nsound--the latch is being slowly raised. A singing noise is in my ears,\nand I have a sense of pressure about the head--\n\nThe latch drops, with a sharp click, into the catch. The noise startles\nme afresh; jarring, horribly, on my tense nerves. After that, I stand,\nfor a long while, amid an ever-growing quietness. All at once, my knees\nbegin to tremble, and I have to sit, quickly.\n\nAn uncertain period of time passes, and, gradually, I begin to shake\noff the feeling of terror, that has possessed me. Yet, still I sit. I\nseem to have lost the power of movement. I am strangely tired, and\ninclined to doze. My eyes open and close, and, presently, I find myself\nfalling asleep, and waking, in fits and starts.\n\nIt is some time later, that I am sleepily aware that one of the candles\nis guttering. When I wake again, it has gone out, and the room is very\ndim, under the light of the one remaining flame. The semi-darkness\ntroubles me little. I have lost that awful sense of dread, and my only\ndesire seems to be to sleep--sleep.\n\nSuddenly, although there is no noise, I am awake--wide awake. I am\nacutely conscious of the nearness of some mystery, of some overwhelming\nPresence. The very air seems pregnant with terror. I sit huddled, and\njust listen, intently. Still, there is no sound. Nature, herself, seems\ndead. Then, the oppressive stillness is broken by a little eldritch\nscream of wind, that sweeps 'round the house, and dies away, remotely.\n\nI let my gaze wander across the half-lighted room. By the great clock\nin the far corner, is a dark, tall shadow. For a short instant, I stare,\nfrightenedly. Then, I see that it is nothing, and am, momentarily,\nrelieved.\n\nIn the time that follows, the thought flashes through my brain, why\nnot leave this house--this house of mystery and terror? Then, as though\nin answer, there sweeps up, across my sight, a vision of the wondrous\nSea of Sleep,--the Sea of Sleep where she and I have been allowed to\nmeet, after the years of separation and sorrow; and I know that I shall\nstay on here, whatever happens.\n\nThrough the side window, I note the somber blackness of the night. My\nglance wanders away, and 'round the room; resting on one shadowy object\nand another. Suddenly, I turn, and look at the window on my right; as I\ndo so, I breathe quickly, and bend forward, with a frightened gaze at\nsomething outside the window, but close to the bars. I am looking at a\nvast, misty swine-face, over which fluctuates a flamboyant flame, of a\ngreenish hue. It is the Thing from the arena. The quivering mouth seems\nto drip with a continual, phosphorescent slaver. The eyes are staring\nstraight into the room, with an inscrutable expression. Thus, I sit\nrigidly--frozen.\n\nThe Thing has begun to move. It is turning, slowly, in my direction.\nIts face is coming 'round toward me. It sees me. Two huge, inhumanly\nhuman, eyes are looking through the dimness at me. I am cold with fear;\nyet, even now, I am keenly conscious, and note, in an irrelevant way,\nthat the distant stars are blotted out by the mass of the giant face.\n\nA fresh horror has come to me. I am rising from my chair, without the\nleast intention. I am on my feet, and something is impelling me toward\nthe door that leads out into the gardens. I wish to stop; but cannot.\nSome immutable power is opposed to my will, and I go slowly forward,\nunwilling and resistant. My glance flies 'round the room, helplessly,\nand stops at the window. The great swine-face has disappeared, and I\nhear, again, that stealthy pad, pad, pad. It stops outside the\ndoor--the door toward which I am being compelled....\n\nThere succeeds a short, intense silence; then there comes a sound. It\nis the rattle of the latch, being slowly lifted. At that, I am filled\nwith desperation. I will not go forward another step. I make a vast\neffort to return; but it is, as though I press back, upon an invisible\nwall. I groan out loud, in the agony of my fear, and the sound of my\nvoice is frightening. Again comes that rattle, and I shiver, clammily. I\ntry--aye, fight and struggle, to hold back, _back_; but it is no use....\n\nI am at the door, and, in a mechanical way, I watch my hand go forward,\nto undo the topmost bolt. It does so, entirely without my volition. Even\nas I reach up toward the bolt, the door is violently shaken, and I get a\nsickly whiff of mouldy air, which seems to drive in through the\ninterstices of the doorway. I draw the bolt back, slowly, fighting,\ndumbly, the while. It comes out of its socket, with a click, and I begin\nto shake, aguishly. There are two more; one at the bottom of the door;\nthe other, a massive affair, is placed about the middle.\n\nFor, perhaps a minute, I stand, with my arms hanging slackly, by my\nsides. The influence to meddle with the fastenings of the door, seems to\nhave gone. All at once, there comes the sudden rattle of iron, at my\nfeet. I glance down, quickly, and realize, with an unspeakable terror,\nthat my foot is pushing back the lower bolt. An awful sense of\nhelplessness assails me.... The bolt comes out of its hold, with a\nslight, ringing sound and I stagger on my feet, grasping at the great,\ncentral bolt, for support. A minute passes, an eternity; then\nanother----My God, help me! I am being forced to work upon the last\nfastening. _I will not!_ Better to die, than open to the Terror, that is\non the other side of the door. Is there no escape ...? God help me, I\nhave jerked the bolt half out of its socket! My lips emit a hoarse\nscream of terror, the bolt is three parts drawn, now, and still my\nunconscious hands work toward my doom. Only a fraction of steel, between\nmy soul and That. Twice, I scream out in the supreme agony of my fear;\nthen, with a mad effort, I tear my hands away. My eyes seem blinded. A\ngreat blackness is falling upon me. Nature has come to my rescue. I feel\nmy knees giving. There is a loud, quick thudding upon the door, and I am\nfalling, falling....\n\nI must have lain there, at least a couple of hours. As I recover, I am\naware that the other candle has burnt out, and the room is in an almost\ntotal darkness. I cannot rise to my feet, for I am cold, and filled with\na terrible cramp. Yet my brain is clear, and there is no longer the\nstrain of that unholy influence.\n\nCautiously, I get upon my knees, and feel for the central bolt. I find\nit, and push it securely back into its socket; then the one at the\nbottom of the door. By this time, I am able to rise to my feet, and so\nmanage to secure the fastening at the top. After that, I go down upon my\nknees, again, and creep away among the furniture, in the direction of\nthe stairs. By doing this, I am safe from observation from the window.\n\nI reach the opposite door, and, as I leave the study, cast one nervous\nglance over my shoulder, toward the window. Out in the night, I seem to\ncatch a glimpse of something impalpable; but it may be only a fancy.\nThen, I am in the passage, and on the stairs.\n\nReaching my bedroom, I clamber into bed, all clothed as I am, and pull\nthe bedclothes over me. There, after awhile, I begin to regain a little\nconfidence. It is impossible to sleep; but I am grateful for the added\nwarmth of the bedclothes. Presently, I try to think over the happenings\nof the past night; but, though I cannot sleep, I find that it is\nuseless, to attempt consecutive thought. My brain seems curiously blank.\n\nToward morning, I begin to toss, uneasily. I cannot rest, and, after\nawhile, I get out of bed, and pace the floor. The wintry dawn is\nbeginning to creep through the windows, and shows the bare discomfort of\nthe old room. Strange, that, through all these years, it has never\noccurred to me how dismal the place really is. And so a time passes.\n\nFrom somewhere down stairs, a sound comes up to me. I go to the bedroom\ndoor, and listen. It is Mary, bustling about the great, old kitchen,\ngetting the breakfast ready. I feel little interest. I am not hungry. My\nthoughts, however; continue to dwell upon her. How little the weird\nhappenings in this house seem to trouble her. Except in the incident of\nthe Pit creatures, she has seemed unconscious of anything unusual\noccurring. She is old, like myself; yet how little we have to do with\none another. Is it because we have nothing in common; or only that,\nbeing old, we care less for society, than quietness? These and other\nmatters pass through my mind, as I meditate; and help to distract my\nattention, for a while, from the oppressive thoughts of the night.\n\nAfter a time, I go to the window, and, opening it, look out. The sun is\nnow above the horizon, and the air, though cold, is sweet and crisp.\nGradually, my brain clears, and a sense of security, for the time being,\ncomes to me. Somewhat happier, I go down stairs, and out into the\ngarden, to have a look at the dog.\n\nAs I approach the kennel, I am greeted by the same mouldy stench that\nassailed me at the door last night. Shaking off a momentary sense of\nfear, I call to the dog; but he takes no heed, and, after calling once\nmore, I throw a small stone into the kennel. At this, he moves,\nuneasily, and I shout his name, again; but do not go closer. Presently,\nmy sister comes out, and joins me, in trying to coax him from\nthe kennel.\n\nIn a little the poor beast rises, and shambles out lurching queerly. In\nthe daylight he stands swaying from side to side, and blinking stupidly.\nI look and note that the horrid wound is larger, much larger, and seems\nto have a whitish, fungoid appearance. My sister moves to fondle him;\nbut I detain her, and explain that I think it will be better not to go\ntoo near him for a few days; as it is impossible to tell what may be the\nmatter with him; and it is well to be cautious.\n\nA minute later, she leaves me; coming back with a basin of odd scraps\nof food. This she places on the ground, near the dog, and I push it into\nhis reach, with the aid of a branch, broken from one of the shrubs. Yet,\nthough the meat should be tempting, he takes no notice of it; but\nretires to his kennel. There is still water in his drinking vessel, so,\nafter a few moments' talk, we go back to the house. I can see that my\nsister is much puzzled as to what is the matter with the animal; yet it\nwould be madness, even to hint the truth to her.\n\nThe day slips away, uneventfully; and night comes on. I have determined\nto repeat my experiment of last night. I cannot say that it is wisdom;\nyet my mind is made up. Still, however, I have taken precautions; for I\nhave driven stout nails in at the back of each of the three bolts, that\nsecure the door, opening from the study into the gardens. This will, at\nleast, prevent a recurrence of the danger I ran last night.\n\nFrom ten to about two-thirty, I watch; but nothing occurs; and,\nfinally, I stumble off to bed, where I am soon asleep.\n\n\n\n_XXVI_\n\nTHE LUMINOUS SPECK\n\nI awake suddenly. It is still dark. I turn over, once or twice, in my\nendeavors to sleep again; but I cannot sleep. My head is aching,\nslightly; and, by turns I am hot and cold. In a little, I give up the\nattempt, and stretch out my hand, for the matches. I will light my\ncandle, and read, awhile; perhaps, I shall be able to sleep, after a\ntime. For a few moments, I grope; then my hand touches the box; but, as\nI open it, I am startled, to see a phosphorescent speck of fire, shining\namid the darkness. I put out my other hand, and touch it. It is on my\nwrist. With a feeling of vague alarm, I strike a light, hurriedly, and\nlook; but can see nothing, save a tiny scratch.\n\n'Fancy!' I mutter, with a half sigh of relief. Then the match burns my\nfinger, and I drop it, quickly. As I fumble for another, the thing\nshines out again. I know, now, that it is no fancy. This time, I light\nthe candle, and examine the place, more closely. There is a slight,\ngreenish discoloration 'round the scratch. I am puzzled and worried.\nThen a thought comes to me. I remember the morning after the Thing\nappeared. I remember that the dog licked my hand. It was this one, with\nthe scratch on it; though I have not been even conscious of the\nabasement, until now. A horrible fear has come to me. It creeps into my\nbrain--the dog's wound, shines at night. With a dazed feeling, I sit\ndown on the side of the bed, and try to think; but cannot. My brain\nseems numbed with the sheer horror of this new fear.\n\nTime moves on, unheeded. Once, I rouse up, and try to persuade myself\nthat I am mistaken; but it is no use. In my heart, I have no doubt.\n\nHour after hour, I sit in the darkness and silence, and shiver,\nhopelessly....\n\nThe day has come and gone, and it is night again.\n\nThis morning, early, I shot the dog, and buried it, away among the\nbushes. My sister is startled and frightened; but I am desperate.\nBesides, it is better so. The foul growth had almost hidden its left\nside. And I--the place on my wrist has enlarged, perceptibly. Several\ntimes, I have caught myself muttering prayers--little things learnt as a\nchild. God, Almighty God, help me! I shall go mad.\n\nSix days, and I have eaten nothing. It is night. I am sitting in my\nchair. Ah, God! I wonder have any ever felt the horror of life that I\nhave come to know? I am swathed in terror. I feel ever the burning of\nthis dread growth. It has covered all my right arm and side, and is\nbeginning to creep up my neck. Tomorrow, it will eat into my face. I\nshall become a terrible mass of living corruption. There is no escape.\nYet, a thought has come to me, born of a sight of the gun-rack, on the\nother side of the room. I have looked again--with the strangest of\nfeelings. The thought grows upon me. God, Thou knowest, Thou must know,\nthat death is better, aye, better a thousand times than This. This!\nJesus, forgive me, but I cannot live, cannot, cannot! I dare not! I am\nbeyond all help--there is nothing else left. It will, at least, spare\nme that final horror....\n\nI think I must have been dozing. I am very weak, and oh! so miserable,\nso miserable and tired--tired. The rustle of the paper, tries my brain.\nMy hearing seems preternaturally sharp. I will sit awhile and think....\n\n\"Hush! I hear something, down--down in the cellars. It is a creaking\nsound. My God, it is the opening of the great, oak trap. What can be\ndoing that? The scratching of my pen deafens me ... I must listen....\nThere are steps on the stairs; strange padding steps, that come up and\nnearer.... Jesus, be merciful to me, an old man. There is something\nfumbling at the door-handle. O God, help me now! Jesus--The door is\nopening--slowly. Somethi--\"\n\nThat is all[16]\n\n\n\n_XXVII_\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI put down the Manuscript, and glanced across at Tonnison: he was\nsitting, staring out into the dark. I waited a minute; then I spoke.\n\n\"Well?\" I said.\n\nHe turned, slowly, and looked at me. His thoughts seemed to have gone\nout of him into a great distance.\n\n\"Was he mad?\" I asked, and indicated the MS., with a half nod.\n\nTonnison stared at me, unseeingly, a moment; then, his wits came back to\nhim, and, suddenly, he comprehended my question.\n\n\"No!\" he said.\n\nI opened my lips, to offer a contradictory opinion; for my sense of the\nsaneness of things, would not allow me to take the story literally; then\nI shut them again, without saying anything. Somehow, the certainty in\nTonnison's voice affected my doubts. I felt, all at once, less assured;\nthough I was by no means convinced as yet.\n\nAfter a few moments' silence, Tonnison rose, stiffly, and began to\nundress. He seemed disinclined to talk; so I said nothing; but followed\nhis example. I was weary; though still full of the story I had\njust read.\n\nSomehow, as I rolled into my blankets, there crept into my mind a memory\nof the old gardens, as we had seen them. I remembered the odd fear that\nthe place had conjured up in our hearts; and it grew upon me, with\nconviction, that Tonnison was right.\n\nIt was very late when we rose--nearly midday; for the greater part of\nthe night had been spent in reading the MS.\n\nTonnison was grumpy, and I felt out of sorts. It was a somewhat dismal\nday, and there was a touch of chilliness in the air. There was no\nmention of going out fishing on either of our parts. We got dinner, and,\nafter that, just sat and smoked in silence.\n\nPresently, Tonnison asked for the Manuscript: I handed it to him, and he\nspent most of the afternoon in reading it through by himself.\n\nIt was while he was thus employed, that a thought came to me:--\n\n\"What do you say to having another look at--?\" I nodded my head down\nstream.\n\nTonnison looked up. \"Nothing!\" he said, abruptly; and, somehow, I was\nless annoyed, than relieved, at his answer.\n\nAfter that, I left him alone.\n\nA little before teatime, he looked up at me, curiously.\n\n\"Sorry, old chap, if I was a bit short with you just now;\" (just now,\nindeed! he had not spoken for the last three hours) \"but I would not go\nthere again,\" and he indicated with his head, \"for anything that you\ncould offer me. Ugh!\" and he put down that history of a man's terror and\nhope and despair.\n\nThe next morning, we rose early, and went for our accustomed swim: we\nhad partly shaken off the depression of the previous day; and so, took\nour rods when we had finished breakfast, and spent the day at our\nfavorite sport.\n\nAfter that day, we enjoyed our holiday to the utmost; though both of us\nlooked forward to the time when our driver should come; for we were\ntremendously anxious to inquire of him, and through him among the people\nof the tiny hamlet, whether any of them could give us information about\nthat strange garden, lying away by itself in the heart of an almost\nunknown tract of country.\n\nAt last, the day came, on which we expected the driver to come across\nfor us. He arrived early, while we were still abed; and, the first thing\nwe knew, he was at the opening of the tent, inquiring whether we had had\ngood sport. We replied in the affirmative; and then, both together,\nalmost in the same breath, we asked the question that was uppermost in\nour minds:--Did he know anything about an old garden, and a great pit,\nand a lake, situated some miles away, down the river; also, had he ever\nheard of a great house thereabouts?\n\nNo, he did not, and had not; yet, stay, he had heard a rumor, once upon\na time, of a great, old house standing alone out in the wilderness; but,\nif he remembered rightly it was a place given over to the fairies; or,\nif that had not been so, he was certain that there had been something\n\"quare\" about it; and, anyway, he had heard nothing of it for a very\nlong while--not since he was quite a gossoon. No, he could not remember\nanything particular about it; indeed, he did not know he remembered\nanything \"at all, at all\" until we questioned him.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Tonnison, finding that this was about all that he\ncould tell us, \"just take a walk 'round the village, while we dress, and\nfind out something, if you can.\"\n\nWith a nondescript salute, the man departed on his errand; while we made\nhaste to get into our clothes; after which, we began to prepare\nbreakfast.\n\nWe were just sitting down to it, when he returned.\n\n\"It's all in bed the lazy divvils is, sor,\" he said, with a repetition\nof the salute, and an appreciative eye to the good things spread out on\nour provision chest, which we utilized as a table.\n\n\"Oh, well, sit down,\" replied my friend, \"and have something to eat with\nus.\" Which the man did without delay.\n\nAfter breakfast, Tonnison sent him off again on the same errand, while\nwe sat and smoked. He was away some three-quarters of an hour, and, when\nhe returned, it was evident that he had found out something. It appeared\nthat he had got into conversation with an ancient man of the village,\nwho, probably, knew more--though it was little enough--of the strange\nhouse, than any other person living.\n\nThe substance of this knowledge was, that, in the \"ancient man's\"\nyouth--and goodness knows how long back that was--there had stood a\ngreat house in the center of the gardens, where now was left only that\nfragment of ruin. This house had been empty for a great while; years\nbefore his--the ancient man's--birth. It was a place shunned by the\npeople of the village, as it had been shunned by their fathers before\nthem. There were many things said about it, and all were of evil. No one\never went near it, either by day or night. In the village it was a\nsynonym of all that is unholy and dreadful.\n\nAnd then, one day, a man, a stranger, had ridden through the village,\nand turned off down the river, in the direction of the House, as it was\nalways termed by the villagers. Some hours afterward, he had ridden\nback, taking the track by which he had come, toward Ardrahan. Then, for\nthree months or so, nothing was heard. At the end of that time, he\nreappeared; but now, he was accompanied by an elderly woman, and a large\nnumber of donkeys, laden with various articles. They had passed through\nthe village without stopping, and gone straight down the bank of the\nriver, in the direction of the House.\n\nSince that time, no one, save the man whom they had chartered to bring\nover monthly supplies of necessaries from Ardrahan, had ever seen either\nof them: and him, none had ever induced to talk; evidently, he had been\nwell paid for his trouble.\n\nThe years had moved onward, uneventfully enough, in that little hamlet;\nthe man making his monthly journeys, regularly.\n\nOne day, he had appeared as usual on his customary errand. He had passed\nthrough the village without exchanging more than a surly nod with the\ninhabitants and gone on toward the House. Usually, it was evening before\nhe made the return journey. On this occasion, however, he had reappeared\nin the village, a few hours later, in an extraordinary state of\nexcitement, and with the astounding information, that the House had\ndisappeared bodily, and that a stupendous pit now yawned in the place\nwhere it had stood.\n\nThis news, it appears, so excited the curiosity of the villagers, that\nthey overcame their fears, and marched _en masse_ to the place. There,\nthey found everything, just as described by the carrier.\n\nThis was all that we could learn. Of the author of the MS., who he was,\nand whence he came, we shall never know.\n\nHis identity is, as he seems to have desired, buried forever.\n\nThat same day, we left the lonely village of Kraighten. We have never\nbeen there since.\n\nSometimes, in my dreams, I see that enormous pit, surrounded, as it is,\non all sides by wild trees and bushes. And the noise of the water rises\nupward, and blends--in my sleep--with other and lower noises; while,\nover all, hangs the eternal shroud of spray.\n\n\n\nGrief[17]\n\nFierce hunger reigns within my breast,\n  I had not dreamt that this whole world,\n    Crushed in the hand of God, could yield\nSuch bitter essence of unrest,\n  Such pain as Sorrow now hath hurled\n    Out of its dreadful heart, unsealed!\n\nEach sobbing breath is but a cry,\n  My heart-strokes knells of agony,\n    And my whole brain has but one thought\nThat nevermore through life shall I\n  (Save in the ache of memory)\n    Touch hands with thee, who now art naught!\n\nThrough the whole void of night I search,\n  So dumbly crying out to thee;\n    But thou are _not_; and night's vast throne\nBecomes an all stupendous church\n  With star-bells knelling unto me\n    Who in all space am most alone!\n\nAn hungered, to the shore I creep,\n  Perchance some comfort waits on me\n    From the old Sea's eternal heart;\nBut lo! from all the solemn deep,\n  Far voices out of mystery\n    Seem questioning why we are apart!\n\n\"Where'er I go I am alone\n  Who once, through thee, had all the world.\n    My breast is one whole raging pain\nFor that which _was_, and now is flown\n  Into the Blank where life is hurled\n    Where all is not, nor is again!\"\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] An apparently unmeaning interpolation. I can find no previous\nreference in the MS. to this matter. It becomes clearer, however, in the\nlight of succeeding incidents.--Ed.\n\n[2] Here, the writing becomes undecipherable, owing to the damaged\ncondition of this part of the MS. Below I print such fragments as are\nlegible.--Ed.\n\n[3] NOTE.--The severest scrutiny has not enabled me to decipher more of\nthe damaged portion of the MS. It commences to be legible again with the\nchapter entitled \"The Noise in the Night.\"--Ed.\n\n[4] The Recluse uses this as an illustration, evidently in the sense of\nthe popular conception of a comet.--Ed.\n\n[5] Evidently referring to something set forth in the missing and\nmutilated pages. See _Fragments, Chapter 14_--Ed.\n\n[6] No further mention is made of the moon. From what is said here, it\nis evident that our satellite had greatly increased its distance from\nthe earth. Possibly, at a later age it may even have broken loose from\nour attraction. I cannot but regret that no light is shed on this\npoint.--Ed.\n\n[7] Conceivably, frozen air.--Ed.\n\n[8] See previous footnote. This would explain the snow (?) within the\nroom.--Ed.\n\n[9] I am confounded that neither here, nor later on, does the Recluse\nmake any further mention of the continued north and south movement\n(apparent, of course,) of the sun from solstice to solstice.--Ed.\n\n[10] At this time the sound-carrying atmosphere must have been either\nincredibly attenuated, or--more probably--nonexistent. In the light of\nthis, it cannot be supposed that these, or any other, noises would have\nbeen apparent to living ears--to hearing, as we, in the material body,\nunderstand that sense.--Ed.\n\n[11] I can only suppose that the time of the earth's yearly journey had\nceased to bear its present _relative_ proportion to the period of the\nsun's rotation.--Ed.\n\n[12] A careful reading of the MS. suggests that, either the sun is\ntraveling on an orbit of great eccentricity, or else that it was\napproaching the green star on a lessening orbit. And at this moment, I\nconceive it to be finally torn directly from its oblique course, by the\ngravitational pull of the immense star.--Ed.\n\n[13] It will be noticed here that the earth was \"_slowly_ traversing the\ntremendous face of the dead sun.\" No explanation is given of this, and\nwe must conclude, either that the speed of time had slowed, or else that\nthe earth was actually progressing on its orbit at a rate, slow, when\nmeasured by existing standards. A careful study of the MS. however,\nleads me to conclude that the speed of time had been steadily decreasing\nfor a very considerable period.--Ed.\n\n[14] See _first footnote, Chapter 18_.\n\n[15] Without doubt, the flame-edged mass of the Dead Central Sun, seen\nfrom another dimension.--Ed.\n\n[16] NOTE.--From the unfinished word, it is possible, on the MS., to\ntrace a faint line of ink, which suggests that the pen has trailed away\nover the paper; possibly, through fright and weakness.--Ed.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The House on the Borderland\nby William Hope Hodgson\n\n*** "}, {"short_book_title": "My First Years As A Frenchwoman 1876-1879 by Mary King Waddington", "publication_date": 1914, "url": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10003", "text": "\n\n\n\nThis file was produced from images generously made available by the Bibliotheque nationale de France (BnF/Gallica) at http://gallica.bnf.fr., carlo traverso, Charlie Kirschner and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.\n\n\n\n\nMY FIRST YEARS AS A\nFRENCHWOMAN\n\n[Illustration: Madame Waddington.\nFrom a photograph taken in the year of the Exposition, 1878.]\n\nMY FIRST YEARS AS A\nFRENCHWOMAN\n\n1876-1879\n\nBY\n\nMARY KING WADDINGTON\n\nILLUSTRATED\n\n1914\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n   I.

SADI CARNOT\n\nPRESIDENT SADI CARNOT\n\n\n\n\nMY FIRST YEARS AS A FRENCHWOMAN\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nWHEN MACMAHON WAS PRESIDENT\n\nI was married in Paris in November, 1874, at the French Protestant\nChapel of the rue Taitbout, by Monsieur Bersier, one of the ablest and\nmost eloquent pastors of the Protestant church. We had just established\nourselves in Paris, after having lived seven years in Rome. We had a\nvague idea of going back to America, and Paris seemed a first step in\nthat direction--was nearer New York than Rome. I knew very little of\nFrance--we had never lived there--merely stayed a few weeks in the\nspring and autumn, coming and going from Italy. My husband was a deputy,\nnamed to the National Assembly in Bordeaux in 1871, by his\nDepartment--the Aisne. He had some difficulty in getting to Bordeaux.\nCommunications and transports were not easy, as the Germans were still\nin the country, and, what was more important, he hadn't any\nmoney--couldn't correspond with his banker, in Paris--(he was living in\nthe country). However, a sufficient amount was found in the country, and\nhe was able to make his journey. When I married, the Assembly was\nsitting at Versailles. Monsieur Thiers, the first President of the\nRepublic, had been overthrown in May, 1873--Marshal MacMahon named in\nhis place. W.[1] had had a short ministry (public instruction) under\nMonsieur Thiers, but he was so convinced that it would not last that he\nnever even went to the ministry--saw his directors in his own rooms. I\nwas plunged at once into absolutely new surroundings. W.'s personal\nfriends were principally Orleanists and the literary element of\nParis--his colleagues at the Institute. The first houses I was taken to\nin Paris were the Segurs, Remusats, Lasteyries, Casimir Periers,\nGallieras, d'Haussonville, Leon Say, and some of the Protestant\nfamilies--Pourtales, Andre Bartholdi, Mallet, etc. It was such an\nentirely different world from any I had been accustomed to that it took\nme some time to feel at home in my new milieu. Political feeling was\nvery strong--all sorts of fresh, young elements coming to the front.\nThe Franco-German War was just over--the French very sore and bitter\nafter their defeat. There was a strong underlying feeling of violent\nanimosity to the Emperor, who had lost them two of their fairest\nprovinces, and a passionate desire for the revanche. The feeling was\nvery bitter between the two branches of the Royalist party, Legitimists\nand Orleanists. One night at a party in the Faubourg St. Germain, I saw\na well-known fashionable woman of the extreme Legitimist party turn her\nback on the Comtesse de Paris. The receptions and visits were not always\neasy nor pleasant, even though I was a stranger and had no ties with any\nformer government. I remember one of my first visits to a well-known\nLegitimist countess in the Faubourg St. Germain; I went on her reception\nday, a thing all young women are most particular about in Paris. I found\nher with a circle of ladies sitting around her, none of whom I knew.\nThey were all very civil, only I was astonished at the way the mistress\nof the house mentioned my name every time she spoke to me: \"Madame\nWaddington, etes-vous allee a l'Opera hier soir,\" \"Madame Waddington,\nvous montez a cheval tous les matins, je crois,\" \"Monsieur Waddington va\ntous les vendredis a l'Institut, il me semble,\" etc. I was rather\nsurprised and said to W. when I got home, \"How curious it is, that way\nof saying one's name all the time; I suppose it is an old-fashioned\nFrench custom. Madame de B. must have said 'Waddington' twenty times\nduring my rather short visit.\" He was much amused. \"Don't you know why?\nSo that all the people might know who you were and not say awful things\nabout the 'infecte gouvernement' and the Republic, 'which no gentleman\ncould serve.'\"\n\n[Footnote 1: \"W.,\" here and throughout this book, refers to Madame\nWaddington's husband, M. William Waddington.]\n\n[Illustration: Monsieur Theirs.]\n\nThe position of the German Embassy in Paris was very difficult, and\nunfortunately their first ambassador after the war, Count Arnim, didn't\nunderstand (perhaps didn't care to) how difficult it was for a\nhigh-spirited nation, which until then had always ranked as a great\nmilitary power, to accept her humiliation and be just to the victorious\nadversary. Arnim was an unfortunate appointment--not at all the man for\nsuch a delicate situation. We had known him in Rome in the old days of\nPio Nono's reign, where he had a great position as Prussian minister to\nthe Vatican. He and the Countess Arnim received a great deal, and their\nbeautiful rooms in the Palazzo Caffarelli, on the top of the Capitol\nHill (the two great statues of Castor and Pollux standing by their\nhorses looking as if they were guarding the entrance) were a brilliant\ncentre for all the Roman and diplomatic world. He was a thorough man of\nthe world, could make himself charming when he chose, but he never had a\npleasant manner, was curt, arrogant, with a very strong sense of his own\nsuperiority. From the first moment he came to Paris as ambassador, he\nput people's backs up. They never liked him, never trusted him; whenever\nhe had an unpleasant communication to make, he exaggerated the\nunpleasantness, never attenuated, and there is so much in the way things\nare said. The French were very hard upon him when he got into trouble,\nand certainly his own Government was merciless to him.\n\nOne of my first small difficulties after becoming a Frenchwoman was to\neliminate some of my German friends from my salon. I could not run the\nrisk of their being treated rudely. I remember so well one night at\nhome, before I was married, seeing two French officers not in uniform\nslip quietly out of the room when one of the German Embassy came in, yet\nours was a neutral house. When my engagement was announced one of my\ngreat friends at the German Embassy (Count Arco) said to me: \"This is\nthe end, I suppose, of our friendship; I can never go to see you when\nyou are the wife of a French deputy.\" \"Oh, yes, you can still come; not\nquite so often, perhaps, but I can't give up my friends.\" However, we\ndrifted apart without knowing why exactly. It is curious how long that\nhostile feeling toward Germany has lasted in France.\n\nEvery year there is a great review of the Paris garrison (thirty\nthousand men) by the President of the Republic, at Longchamp, on the\n14th of July, the national fete--the day of the storming of the Bastile.\nIt is a great day in Paris--one of the sights of the year--and falling\nin midsummer the day is generally beautiful and very warm. From early\ndawn all the chairs and benches along the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne are\ncrowded with people waiting patiently for hours to see the show. There\nis not a seat to be had at Longchamp. Unless one arrives very early the\ntribunes are packed, and the President's box very crowded, as he invites\nthe diplomatic corps and the ministers and their wives on that day. The\ntroops are always received with much enthusiasm, particularly the\nartillery, dragging their light field-pieces and passing at a\ngallop--also the battalion of St. Cyr, the great French military school.\nThe final charge of the cavalry is very fine. Masses of riders come\nthundering over the plain, the general commanding in front, stopping\nsuddenly as if moved by machinery, just opposite the President's box.\nI went very regularly as long as W. was in office, and always enjoyed my\nday. There was an excellent buffet in the salon behind the box, and it\nwas pleasant to have a cup of tea and rest one's eyes while the long\ncolumns of infantry were passing--the regular, continuous movement was\nfatiguing. All the ambassadors and foreigners were very keen about the\nreview, paying great attention to the size of the men and horses and\ntheir general equipment. As long as Marshal MacMahon was President of\nthe Republic, he always rode home after the review down the\nChamps-Elysees--in full uniform, with a brilliant staff of foreign\nofficers and military attaches. It was a pretty sight and attracted\ngreat attention. Some of the foreign uniforms are very striking and the\nFrench love a military show.\n\n[Illustration: Marshal MacMahon.]\n\nFor many years after the war the German military attache returned from\nthe review unobserved in a _shut_ carriage, couldn't run the risk of an\nangry or insulting word from some one in the crowd, and still later,\nfifteen years after the war, when W. was ambassador in England, I was\ngodmother of the daughter of a German-English cousin living in London.\nThe godfather was Count Herbert Bismarck, son of the famous chancellor.\nAt the time of the christening I was in France, staying with some\nfriends in the country. The son of the house had been through the war,\nhad distinguished himself very much, and they were still very sore over\ntheir reverses and the necessity of submitting to all the little\npin-pricks which came at intervals from Germany. Bismarck sent me a\ntelegram regretting the absence of the godmother from the ceremony. It\nwas brought to me just after breakfast, while we were having our coffee.\nI opened it and read it out, explaining that it was from Bismarck to\nexpress his regret for my absence. There was a dead silence, and then\nthe mistress of the house said to me: \"C'est tres desagreable pour vous,\nchere amie, cette association avec Bismarck.\"\n\nI didn't see much of W. in the daytime. We usually rode in the morning\nin the Bois and immediately after breakfast he started for Versailles in\nthe parliamentary train. Dinner was always a doubtful meal. Sometimes he\ncame home very late for nine-o'clock dinner; sometimes he dined at\nVersailles and only got home at ten or eleven if the sitting was stormy.\nThe Hotel des Reservoirs did a flourishing business as long as the\nChambers sat at Versailles. When we were dining out it was very\ndisagreeable, particularly the first winter when I didn't know many\npeople. I remember one dinner at the Countess Duchatel's where I went\nalone; we were ten women and five men. All the rest were deputies, who\nhad telegraphed at the last moment they would not come, were kept at\nVersailles by an important question.\n\nOne of the most interesting things I saw in 1873, just before my\nmarriage, was the court-martial of Marshal Bazaine for treachery at\nMetz--giving up his army and the city without any attempt to break\nthrough the enemy's lines, or in fact any resistance of any kind. The\ncourt was held at the Grand Trianon, Versailles, a place so associated\nwith a pleasure-loving court, and the fanciful devices of a gay young\nqueen, that it was difficult to realise the drama that was being\nenacted, when the honour of a Marshal of France--almost an army of\nFrance, was to be judged. It was an impressive scene, the hall packed,\nand people at all the doors and entrances clamouring for seats. The\npublic was curious, a little of everything--members of the National\nAssembly, officers all in uniform, pretty women of all categories--the\ngroup of journalists with keen eager faces watching every change of\nexpression of the marshal's face--some well-known faces, wives of\nmembers or leading political and literary men, a fair amount of the\nfrailer sisterhood, actresses and demi-mondaines, making a great effect\nof waving plumes and diamonds. The court was presided over by the Duc\nd'Aumale, who accepted the office after much hesitation. He was a fine,\nsoldierly figure as he came in, in full uniform, a group of officers\nbehind him, all with stern, set faces. The impression of the public was\ngenerally hostile to the marshal; one felt it all through the trial. He\nwas dressed in full uniform, with the grand cordon of the Legion of\nHonour. It was melancholy to hear the report of his career when it was\nread by his counsel,--long years of active service, many wounds, often\nmentioned for brave conduct under fire, having the \"Medaille\nMilitaire\"--the grand cordon of the Legion d'Honneur, the baton de\nMarechal de France,--all the honours his country could give him--to end\nso miserably, judged not only by the court but by the country, as a\ntraitor, false to his trust, when his country was in the death-throes of\ndefeat and humiliation. His attitude at the trial was curious. He sat\nvery still in his armchair, looking straight before him, only raising\nhis head and looking at the Duc d'Aumale when some grave accusation was\nmade against him. His explanation brought the famous reply from the duc,\nwhen he said it was impossible to act or to treat; there was nothing\nleft in France--no government, no orders--nothing. The due answered:\n\"Il y avait toujours la France.\" He didn't look overwhelmed, rather like\nsome one who was detached from the whole proceedings. I saw his face\nquite well; it was neither false nor weak--ordinary. It is difficult to\nbelieve that a French general with a brilliant record behind him should\nhave been guilty of such treachery, sacrificing his men and his honour.\nHis friends (they were not many) say he lost his head, was nearly crazy\nwith the utterly unforeseen defeat of the French, but even a moment of\ninsanity would hardly account for such extraordinary weakness. W. and\nsome of his friends were discussing it in the train coming home. They\nwere all convinced of his guilt, had no doubt as to what the sentence of\nthe court would be--death and degradation--but thought that physical\nfatigue and great depression must have caused a general breakdown. The\nend every one knows. He was condemned to be shot and degraded. The first\npart of the sentence was cancelled on account of his former services,\nbut he was degraded, imprisoned, escaped, and finished his life in Spain\nin poverty and obscurity, deserted by all his friends and his wife. It\nwas a melancholy rentree for the Duc d'Aumale. His thoughts must have\ngone back to the far-off days when the gallant young officer, fils de\nFrance, won his first military glory in Algiers, and thought the world\nwas at his feet. His brilliant exploit, capturing the Smala of\nAbd-el-Kader, has been immortalised by Vernet in the great historical\npicture that one sees at Versailles. There are always artists copying\nparts of it, particularly one group, where a lovely, fair-haired woman\nis falling out of a litter backward. Even now, when one thinks of the\nKing Louis Philippe, with all his tall, strong, young sons (there is a\nwell-known picture of the King on horseback with all his sons around\nhim--splendid specimens of young manhood), it seems incredible that they\nare not still ruling and reigning at the Tuileries. I wonder if things\nwould have been very different if Louis Philippe and his family had not\nwalked out of the Tuileries that day!\n\nI often asked W. in what way France had gained by being a republic. I\npersonally was quite impartial, being born an American and never having\nlived in France until after the Franco-Prussian War. I had no particular\nties nor traditions, had no grandfather killed on the scaffold, nor\nfrozen to death in the retreat of \"La Grande Armee\" from Moscow. They\nalways told me a republic was in the air--young talents and energy must\ncome to the front--the people must have a voice in the government. I\nthink the average Frenchman is intelligent, but I don't think the vote\nof the man in the street can have as much value as that of a man who has\nhad not only a good education but who has been accustomed always to hear\ncertain principles of law and order held up as rules for the guidance of\nhis own life as well as other people's. Certainly universal suffrage was\na most unfortunate measure to take from America and apply to France, but\nit has been taken and now must stay. I have often heard political men\nwho deplored and condemned the law say that no minister would dare to\npropose a change.\n\nI went often to the Chamber in the spring--used to drive out and bring\nW. home. Versailles was very animated and interesting during all that\ntime, so many people always about. Quite a number of women followed the\ndebates. One met plenty of people one knew in the streets, at the\nPatissiers, or at some of the bric-a-brac shops, where there were still\nbargains to be found in very old furniture, prints, and china. There is\na large garrison. There were always officers riding, squads of soldiers\nmoving about, bugle-calls in all directions, and continuous arrivals at\nthe station of deputies and journalists hurrying to the palace, their\nblack portfolios under their arms. The palace was cold. There was a fine\ndraught at the entrance and the big stone staircase was always cold,\neven in June, but the assembly-room was warm enough and always crowded.\nIt was rather difficult to get seats. People were so interested in those\nfirst debates after the war, when everything had to be reorganised and\nso much of the past was being swept away.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIMPRESSIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY AT VERSAILLES\n\nThe sittings of the assembly were very interesting in that wonderful\nyear when everything was being discussed. All public interest of course\nwas centred in Versailles, where the National Assembly was trying to\nestablish some sort of stable government. There were endless discussions\nand speeches and very violent language in the Chambers. Gambetta made\nsome bitter attacks on the Royalists, accusing them of mauvaise foi and\nwant of patriotism. The Bonapartist leaders tried to persuade themselves\nand their friends that they still had a hold on the country and that a\nplebiscite would bring back in triumph their prince. The Legitimists,\nhoping against hope that the Comte de Chambord would still be the\nsaviour of the country, made passionate appeals to the old feeling of\nloyalty in the nation, and the centre droit, representing the\nOrleanists, nervous, hesitating, knowing the position perfectly,\nardently desiring a constitutional monarchy, but feeling that it was\nnot possible at that moment, yet unwilling to commit themselves to a\nfinal declaration of the Republic, which would make a Royalist\nrestoration impossible. All the Left confident, determined.\n\nThe Republic was voted on the 30th of January, 1875, by a majority of\none vote, if majority it could be called, but the great step had been\ntaken, and the struggle began instantly between the moderate\nconservative Republicans and the more advanced Left. W. came home late\nthat day. Some of his friends came in after dinner and the talk was most\ninteresting. I was so new to it all that most of the names of the rank\nand file were unknown to me, and the appreciations of the votes and the\nanecdotes and side-lights on the voters said nothing to me. Looking back\nafter all these years, it seems to me that the moderate Royalists\n(centre droit) threw away a splendid chance. They could not stop the\nRepublican wave (nothing could) but they might have controlled it and\ndirected it instead of standing aloof and throwing the power into the\nhands of the Left. We heard the well-known sayings very often those\ndays: \"La Republique sera conservatrice ou elle ne sera pas\" and \"La\nRepublique sans Republicains,\" attributed to M. Thiers and Marshal\nMacMahon. The National Assembly struggled on to the end of the year,\nmaking a constitution, a parliament with two houses, senate and chamber\nof deputies, with many discussions and contradictions, and hopes and\nillusions.\n\n[Illustration: Sitting of the National Assembly at the palace of\nVersailles. From _l'Illustration_, March 11, 1876]\n\nI went often to Versailles, driving out when the weather was fine. I\nliked the stormy sittings best. Some orator would say something that\ndispleased the public, and in a moment there would be the greatest\nuproar, protestations and accusations from all sides, some of the\nextreme Left getting up, gesticulating wildly, and shaking their fists\nat the speaker--the Right, generally calm and sarcastic, requesting the\nspeaker to repeat his monstrous statements--the huissiers dressed in\nblack with silver chains, walking up and down in front of the tribune,\ncalling out at intervals: \"Silence, messieurs, s'il vous plait,\"--the\nPresident ringing his bell violently to call the house to order, and\nnobody paying the slightest attention,--the orator sometimes standing\nquite still with folded arms waiting until the storm should abate,\nsometimes dominating the hall and hurling abuse at his adversaries. W.\nwas always perfectly quiet; his voice was low, not very strong, and he\ncould not speak if there were an uproar. When he was interrupted in a\nspeech he used to stand perfectly still with folded arms, waiting for a\nfew minutes' silence. The deputies would call out: \"Allez! allez!\"\ninterspersed with a few lively criticisms on what he was saying to them;\nhe was perfectly unmoved, merely replied: \"I will go on with pleasure as\nsoon as you will be quiet enough for me to be heard.\" Frenchmen\ngenerally have such a wonderful facility of speech, and such a pitiless\nlogic in discussing a question, that the debates were often very\ninteresting. The public was interesting too. A great many women of all\nclasses followed the sittings--several Egerias (not generally in their\nfirst youth) of well-known political men sitting prominently in the\nPresident's box, or in the front row of the journalists' box, following\nthe discussions with great interest and sending down little slips of\npaper to their friends below--members' wives and friends who enjoyed\nspending an hour or two listening to the speeches--newspaper\ncorrespondents, literary ladies, diplomatists. It was very difficult to\nget places, particularly when some well-known orators were announced to\nspeak upon an important question. We didn't always know beforehand, and\nI remember some dull afternoons with one or two members making long\nspeeches about purely local matters, which didn't interest any one. We\nlooked down upon an almost empty hall on those occasions. A great many\nof the members had gone out and were talking in the lobbies; those who\nremained were talking in groups, writing letters, walking about the\nhall, quite unconscious apparently of the speaker at the tribune. I\ncouldn't understand how the man could go on talking to empty benches,\nbut W. told me he was quite indifferent to the attention of his\ncolleagues,--his speech was for his electors and would appear the next\nday in the _Journal Officiel_. I remember one man talked for hours about\n\"allumettes chimiques.\"\n\nLeon Say was a delightful speaker, so easy, always finding exactly the\nword he wanted. It hardly seemed a speech when he was at the tribune,\nmore like a causerie, though he told very plain truths sometimes to the\npeuple souverain. He was essentially French, or rather Parisian, knew\neverybody, and was au courant of all that went on politically and\nsocially, and had a certain blague, that eminently French quality which\nis very difficult to explain. He was a hard worker, and told me once\nthat what rested him most after a long day was to go to a small\nboulevard theatre or to read a rather lively yellowbacked novel.\n\nI never heard Gambetta speak, which I always regretted--in fact knew\nvery little of him. He was not a ladies' man, though he had some devoted\nwomen friends, and was always surrounded by a circle of political men\nwhenever he appeared in public. (In all French parties, immediately\nafter dinner, the men all congregate together to talk to each\nother,--never to the women,--so unless you happen to find yourself\nseated next to some well-known man, you never really have a chance of\ntalking to him.) Gambetta didn't go out much, and as by some curious\nchance he was never next to me at dinner, I never had any opportunity of\ntalking to him. He was not one of W.'s friends, nor an habitue of the\nhouse. His appearance was against him--dark, heavy-looking, with an\nenormous head.\n\nWhen I had had enough of the speeches and the bad atmosphere, I used to\nwander about the terraces and gardens. How many beautiful sunsets I have\nseen from the top of the terrace or else standing on the three famous\npink marble steps (so well known to all lovers of poetry through Alfred\nde Musset's beautiful verses, \"Trois Marches Roses\"), seeing in\nimagination all the brilliant crowd of courtiers and fair women that\nused to people those wonderful gardens in the old days of Versailles! I\nwent sometimes to the \"Reservoirs\" for a cup of tea, and very often\nfound other women who had also driven out to get their husbands. We\noccasionally brought back friends who preferred the quiet cool drive\nthrough the Park of St. Cloud to the crowd and dust of the railway. The\nCount de St. Vallier (who was not yet senator, but deeply interested in\npolitics) was frequently at Versailles and came back with us often. He\nwas a charming, easy talker. I never tired of hearing about the\nbrilliant days of the last Empire, and the fetes at the Tuileries,\nCompiegne, and St. Cloud. He had been a great deal at the court of\nNapoleon III, had seen many interesting people of all kinds, and had a\nwonderful memory. He must have had an inner sense or presentiment of\nsome kind about the future, for I have heard him say often in speaking\nof the old days and the glories of the Empire, when everything seemed so\nprosperous and brilliant, that he used often to ask himself if it could\nbe real--Were the foundations as solid as they seemed! He had been a\ndiplomatist, was in Germany at the time of the Franco-German War, and\nlike so many of his colleagues scattered over Germany, was quite aware\nof the growing hostile feeling in Germany to France and also of\nBismarck's aims and ambitions. He (like so many others) wrote repeated\nletters and warnings to the French Foreign Office, which apparently had\nno effect. One heard afterward that several letters of that description\nfrom French diplomatists in Germany were found unopened in a drawer at\nthe ministry.\n\nIt was rather sad, as we drove through the stately alleys of the Park of\nSt. Cloud, with the setting sun shining through the fine old trees, to\nhear of all the fetes that used to take place there,--and one could\nquite well fancy the beautiful Empress appearing at the end of one of\nthe long avenues, followed by a brilliant suite of ladies and\necuyers,--and the echoes of the cor de chasse in the distance. The\nalleys are always there, and fairly well kept, but very few people or\ncarriages pass. The park is deserted. I don't think the cor de chasse\nwould awaken an echo or a regret even, so entirely has the Empire and\nits glories become a thing of the past. A rendezvous de chasse was a\nvery pretty sight.\n\nWe went once to Compiegne before I was married, about three years before\nthe war. We went out and breakfasted at Compiegne with a great friend of\nours, M. de St. M., a chamberlain or equerry of the Emperor. We\nbreakfasted in a funny old-fashioned little hotel (with a very good\ncuisine) and drove in a big open break to the forest. There were a great\nmany people riding, driving, and walking, officers of the garrison in\nuniform, members of the hunt in green and gold, and a fair sprinkling of\nred coats. The Empress looked charming, dressed always in the uniform of\nthe hunt, green with gold braid, and a tricorne on her head,--all her\nladies with the same dress, which was very becoming. One of the most\nstriking-looking of her ladies was the Princess Anna Murat, the present\nDuchesse de Mouchy, who looked very handsome in the tricorne and\nbeautifully fitting habit. I didn't see the Empress on her horse, as we\nlost sight of them very soon. She and her ladies arrived on the field in\nan open break. I saw the Emperor quite distinctly as he rode up and gave\nsome orders. He was very well mounted (there were some beautiful horses)\nbut stooped slightly, and had rather a sad face. I never saw him again,\nand the Empress only long years after at Cowes, when everything had gone\nout of her life.\n\nThe President, Marshal MacMahon, was living at the Prefecture at\nVersailles and received every Thursday evening. We went there several\ntimes--it was my first introduction to the official world. The first two\nor three times we drove out, but it was long (quite an hour and a\nquarter) over bad roads--a good deal of pavement. One didn't care to\ndrive through the Park of St. Cloud at night--it was very lonely and\ndark. We should have been quite helpless if we had fallen upon any\nenterprising tramps, who could easily have stopped the carriage and\nhelped themselves to any money or jewels they could lay their hands on.\nOne evening the Seine had overflowed and we were obliged to walk a long\ndistance--all around Sevres--and got to Versailles very late and quite\nexhausted with the jolting and general discomfort. After that we went\nout by train--which put us at the Prefecture at ten o'clock. It wasn't\nvery convenient as there was a great rush for carriages when we arrived\nat Versailles, still everybody did it. We generally wore black or dark\ndresses with a lace veil tied over our heads, and of course only went\nwhen it was fine. The evening was pleasant enough--one saw all the\npolitical men, the marshal's personal friends of the droite went to him\nin the first days of his presidency,--(they rather fell off later)--the\nGovernment and Republicans naturally and all the diplomatic corps. There\nwere not many women, as it really was rather an effort to put one's self\ninto a low-necked dress and start off directly after dinner to the Gare\nSt. Lazare, and have rather a rush for places. We were always late, and\njust had time to scramble into the last carriage.\n\nI felt very strange--an outsider--all the first months, but my husband's\nfriends were very nice to me and after a certain time I was astonished\nto find how much politics interested me. I learned a great deal from\nmerely listening while the men talked at dinner. I suppose I should have\nunderstood much more if I had read the papers regularly, but I didn't\nbegin to do that until W. had been minister for some time, and then\nworked myself into a nervous fever at all the opposition papers said\nabout him. However, all told, the attacks were never very vicious. He\nhad never been in public life until after the war when he was named\ndeputy and joined the Assemblee Nationale at Bordeaux--which was an\nimmense advantage to him. He had never served any other government, and\nwas therefore perfectly independent and was bound by no family\ntraditions or old friendships--didn't mind the opposition papers at\nall--not even the caricatures. Some of them were very funny. There was\none very like him, sitting quite straight and correct on the box of a\nbrougham, \"John Cocher Anglais n'a jamais verse, ni accroche\" (English\ncoachman who has never upset nor run into anything).\n\nThere were a few political salons. The Countess de R. received every\nevening--but only men--no women were ever asked. The wives rather\ndemurred at first, but the men went all the same--as one saw every one\nthere and heard all the latest political gossip. Another hostess was the\nPrincess Lize Troubetskoi. She was a great friend and admirer of\nThiers--was supposed to give him a great deal of information from\nforeign governments. She was very eclectic in her sympathies, and every\none went to her, not only French, but all foreigners of any distinction\nwho passed through Paris. She gave herself a great deal of trouble for\nher friends, but also used them when she wanted anything. One of the\nstories which was always told of the Foreign Office was her \"petit\npaquet,\" which she wanted to send by the valise to Berlin, when the\nComte de St. Vallier was French ambassador there. He agreed willingly to\nreceive the package addressed to him, which proved to be a grand piano.\n\nThe privilege of sending packages abroad by the valise of the foreign\naffairs was greatly abused when W. became Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nHe made various changes, one of which was that the valise should be\nabsolutely restricted to official papers and documents, which really was\nperhaps well observed.\n\nThe Countess de Segur received every Saturday night. It was really an\nOrleanist salon, as they were devoted friends of the Orleans family, but\none saw all the moderate Republicans there and the centre gauche (which\nstruggled so long to keep together and be a moderating influence, but\nhas long been swallowed up in the ever-increasing flood of radicalism)\nand a great many literary men, members of the Institute, Academicians,\netc. They had a fine old house entre cour et jardin, with all sorts of\ninteresting pictures and souvenirs. Countess de S. also received every\nday before three o'clock. I often went and was delighted when I could\nfind her alone. She was very clever, very original, had known all sorts\nof people, and it was most interesting to hear her talk about King Louis\nPhilippe's court, the Spanish marriages, the death of the Duc d'Orleans,\nthe Coup d'Etat of Louis Napoleon, etc. When she first began to receive,\nduring the reign of Louis Philippe, the feeling was very bitter between\nthe Legitimists (extreme Royalist party) and the Orleanists. The Duc\nd'Orleans often came to them on Saturday evenings and always in a good\ndeal of state, with handsome carriage, aides-de-camp, etc. She warned\nher Legitimist friends when she knew he was coming (but she didn't\nalways know) and said she never had any trouble or disagreeable scenes.\nEvery one was perfectly respectful to the duke, but the extreme\nLegitimists went away at once.\n\nWe went quite often to Monsieur and Madame Thiers, who received every\nevening in their big gloomy house in the Place St. Georges. It was a\npolitical centre,--all the Republican party went there, and many of his\nold friends, Orleanists, who admired his great intelligence, while\ndisapproving his politics,--literary men, journalists, all the\ndiplomatists and distinguished strangers. He had people at dinner every\nnight and a small reception afterward,--Madame Thiers and her sister,\nMademoiselle Dosne, doing the honours for him. I believe both ladies\nwere very intelligent, but I can't truthfully say they had any charm of\nmanner. They never looked pleased to see any one, and each took\ncomfortable little naps in their armchairs after dinner--the first\ncomers had sometimes rather embarrassing entrances,--but I am told they\nheld very much to their receptions. Thiers was wonderful; he was a very\nold man when I knew him, but his eyes were very bright and keen, his\nvoice strong, and he would talk all the evening without any appearance\nof fatigue. He slept every afternoon for two hours, and was quite rested\nand alert by dinner time. It was an interesting group of men that stood\naround the little figure in the drawing-room after dinner. He himself\nstood almost always leaning against the mantelpiece. Prince Orloff,\nRussian ambassador, was one of the habitues of the salon, and I was\nalways delighted when he would slip away from the group of men and join\nthe ladies in Madame Thiers's salon, which was less interesting. He knew\neverybody, French and foreign, and gave me most amusing and useful\nlittle sketches of all the celebrities. It was he who told me of old\nPrince Gortschakoff's famous phrase when he heard of Thiers's death--(he\ndied at St. Germain in 1877)--\"Encore une lumiere eteinte quand il y en\na si peu qui voient clair,\"--(still another light extinguished, when\nthere are so few who see clearly). Many have gone of that\ngroup,--Casimir Perier, Leon Say, Jules Ferry, St. Vallier, Comte Paul\nde Segur, Barthelemy St. Hilaire,--but others remain, younger men who\nwere then beginning their political careers and were eager to drink in\nlessons and warnings from the old statesman, who fought gallantly to\nthe last.\n\nI found the first winter in Paris as the wife of a French deputy rather\ntrying, so different from the easy, pleasant life in Rome. That has\nchanged, too, of course, with United Italy and Rome the capital, but it\nwas a small Rome in our days, most informal. I don't ever remember\nhaving written an invitation all the years we lived in Rome. Everybody\nled the same life and we saw each other all day, hunting, riding,\ndriving, in the villas in the afternoon, generally finishing at the\nPincio, where there was music. All the carriages drew up and the young\nmen came and talked to the women exactly as if they were at the opera or\nin a ballroom. When we had music or danced at our house, we used to tell\nsome well-known man to say \"on danse chez Madame King ce soir.\" That was\nall. Paris society is much stiffer, attaches much more importance to\nvisits and reception days.\n\nThere is very little informal receiving, no more evenings with no\namusement of any kind provided, and a small table at one end of the room\nwith orangeade and cakes, which I remember when I was first married (and\nalways in Lent the quartet of the Conservatoire playing classical\nsymphonies, which of course put a stop to all conversation, as people\nlistened to the artists of the Conservatoire in a sort of sacred\nsilence). Now one is invited each time, there is always music or a\ncomedie, sometimes a conference in Lent, and a buffet in the\ndining-room. There is much more luxury, and women wear more jewels.\nThere were not many tiaras when I first knew Paris society; now every\nyoung woman has one in her corbeille.\n\n[Illustration: The foyer of the Opera.]\n\nOne of the first big things I saw in Paris was the opening of the Grand\nOpera. It was a pretty sight, the house crowded with women beautifully\ndressed and wearing fine jewels which showed very little, the decoration\nof the house being very elaborate. There was so much light and gilding\nthat the diamonds were quite lost. The two great features of the evening\nwere the young King of Spain (the father of the present King), a slight,\ndark, youthful figure, and the Lord Mayor of London, who really made\nmuch more effect than the King. He was dressed in his official robes,\nhad two sheriffs and a macebearer, and when he stood at the top of the\ngrand staircase he was an imposing figure and the public was delighted\nwith him. He was surrounded by an admiring crowd when he walked in the\nfoyer. Everybody was there and W. pointed out to me the celebrities of\nall the coteries. We had a box at the opera and went very regularly. The\nopera was never good, never has been since I have known it, but as it is\nopen all the year round, one cannot expect to have the stars one hears\nelsewhere. Still it is always a pleasant evening, one sees plenty of\npeople to talk to and the music is a cheerful accompaniment to\nconversation. It is astounding how they talk in the boxes and how the\npublic submits. The ballet is always good. Halanzier was director of the\nGrand Opera, and we went sometimes to his box behind the scenes, which\nwas most amusing. He was most dictatorial, occupied himself with every\ndetail,--was consequently an excellent director. I remember seeing him\ninspect the corps de ballet one night, just before the curtain went up.\nHe passed down the line like a general reviewing his troops, tapping\nlightly with a cane various arms and legs which were not in position. He\nwas perfectly smiling and good-humoured: \"Voyons, voyons, mes petites,\nce n'est pas cela,\"--but saw everything.\n\nWhat W. liked best was the Theatre Francais. We hadn't a box there, but\nas so many of our friends had, we went very often. Tuesday was the\nfashionable night and the Salle was almost as interesting as the stage,\nparticularly if it happened to be a premiere, and all the critics and\njournalists were there. Sarah Bernhardt and Croizette were both playing\nthose first years. They were great rivals and it was interesting to see\nthem in the same play, both such fine talents yet so totally different.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nM. WADDINGTON AS MINISTER OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION\n\nIn March, 1876, W. was made, for the second time, \"Ministre de\nl'Instruction Publique et des Beaux Arts,\" with M. Dufaure President du\nConseil, Duc Decazes at the Foreign Office, and Leon Say at the\nfinances. His nomination was a surprise to us. We didn't expect it at\nall. There had been so many discussions, so many names put forward. It\nseemed impossible to come to an understanding and form a cabinet which\nwould be equally acceptable to the marshal and to the Chambers. I came\nin rather late one afternoon while the negotiations were going on, and\nwas told by the servants that M. Leon Say was waiting in W.'s library to\nsee him. W. came a few minutes afterward, and the two gentlemen remained\na long time talking. They stopped in the drawing-room on their way to\nthe door, and Say said to me: \"Eh bien, madame, je vous apporte une\nportefeuille et des felicitations.\" \"Before I accept the felicitations,\nI would like to know which portfolio.\" Of course when he said, \"Public\ninstruction,\" I was pleased, as I knew it was the only one W. cared for.\nMy brother-in-law, Richard Waddington, senator of the Seine\nInferieure,[1] and one or two friends came to see us in the evening, and\nthe gentlemen talked late into the night, discussing programmes,\npossibilities, etc. All the next day the conferences went on, and when\nthe new cabinet was presented to the marshal, he received them\ngraciously if not warmly. W. said both Dufaure and Decazes were quite\nwonderful, realising the state of affairs exactly, and knowing the\ntemper of the house, which was getting more advanced every day and more\ndifficult to manage.\n\n[Footnote 1: My brother-in-law, Richard Waddington, senator, died in\nJune, 1913, some time after these notes were written.]\n\nW. at once convoked all the officials and staff of the ministry. He made\nvery few changes, merely taking the young Count de Lasteyrie, now\nMarquis de Lasteyrie, grandnephew of the Marquis de Lafayette, son of M.\nJules de Lasteyrie, a senator and devoted friend of the Orleans family,\nas his chef de cabinet. Two or three days after the new cabinet was\nannounced, W. took me to the Elysee to pay my official visit to the\nMarechale de MacMahon. She received us up-stairs in a pretty salon\nlooking out on the garden. She was very civil, not a particularly\ngracious manner--gave me the impression of a very energetic, practical\nwoman--what most Frenchwomen are. I was very much struck with her\nwriting-table, which looked most businesslike. It was covered with\nquantities of letters, papers, cards, circulars of all kinds--she\nattended to all household matters herself. I always heard (though she\ndid not tell me) that she read every letter that was addressed to her,\nand she must have had hundreds of begging letters. She was very\ncharitable, much interested in all good works, and very kind to all\nartists. Whenever a letter came asking for money, she had the case\ninvestigated, and if the story was true, gave practical help at once. I\nwas dismayed at first with the number of letters received from all over\nFrance asking my intercession with the minister on every possible\nsubject from a \"monument historique\" to be restored, to a pension given\nto an old schoolmaster no longer able to work, with a large family to\nsupport. It was perfectly impossible for me to answer them. Being a\nforeigner and never having lived in France, I didn't really know\nanything about the various questions. W. was too busy to attend to such\nsmall matters, so I consulted M. de L., chef de cabinet, and we agreed\nthat I should send all the correspondence which was not strictly\npersonal to him, and he would have it examined in the \"bureau.\" The\nfirst few weeks of W.'s ministry were very trying to me--I went to see\nso many people,--so many people came to see me,--all strangers with whom\nI had nothing in common. Such dreary conversations, never getting beyond\nthe most ordinary commonplace phrases,--such an absolutely different\nworld from any I had ever lived in.\n\nIt is very difficult at first for any woman who marries a foreigner to\nmake her life in her new country. There must be so many things that are\ndifferent--better perhaps sometimes--but not what one has been\naccustomed to,--and I think more difficult in France than in any other\ncountry. French people are set in their ways, and there is so little\nsympathy with anything that is not French. I was struck with that\nabsence of sympathy at some of the first dinners I went to. The talk was\nexclusively French, almost Parisian, very personal, with stories and\nallusions to people and things I knew nothing about. No one dreamed of\ntalking to me about my past life--or America, or any of my early\nassociations--yet I was a stranger--one would have thought they might\nhave taken a little more trouble to find some topics of general\ninterest. Even now, after all these years, the difference of\nnationality counts. Sometimes when I am discussing with very intimate\nfriends some question and I find that I cannot understand their views\nand they cannot understand mine, they always come back to the real\ndifficulty: \"Ecoutez, chere amie, vous etes d'une autre race.\" I rather\ncomplained to W. after the first three or four dinners--it seemed to me\nbad manners, but he said no, I was the wife of a French political\nman, and every one took for granted I was interested in the\nconversation--certainly no one intended any rudeness. The first big\ndinner I went to that year was at the Elysee--the regular official\ndinner for the diplomatic corps and the Government. I had Baron von\nZuylen, the Dutch minister, one of our great friends, on one side of me,\nLeon Renault, prefet de police, on the other. Leon Renault was very\ninteresting, very clever--an excellent prefet de police. Some of his\nstories were most amusing. The dinner was very good (always were in the\nmarshal's time), not long, and mercifully the room was not too hot.\nSometimes the heat was terrible. There were quite a number of people in\nthe evening--the music of the garde republicaine playing, and a buffet\nin the dining-room which was always crowded. We never stayed very late,\nas W. always had papers to sign when we got home. Sometimes when there\nwas a great press of work his \"signatures\" kept him two hours. I don't\nthink the marshal enjoyed the receptions very much. Like most soldiers\nhe was an early riser, and the late hours and constant talking\ntired him.\n\nI liked our dinners and receptions at the ministry. All the intelligence\nof France passed through our rooms. People generally came early--by ten\no'clock the rooms were quite full. Every one was announced, and it was\nmost interesting to hear the names of all the celebrities in every\nbranch of art and science. It was only a fleeting impression, as the\nguests merely spoke to me at the door and passed on. In those days,\nhardly any one shook hands unless they were fairly intimate--the men\nnever. They made me low bows some distance off and rarely stopped to\nexchange a few words with me. Some of the women, not many, shook hands.\nIt was a fatiguing evening, as I stood so long, and a procession of\nstrangers passed before me. The receptions finished early--every one had\ngone by eleven o'clock except a few loiterers at the buffet. There are\nalways a certain number of people at the big official receptions whose\nprincipal object in coming seems to be to make a comfortable meal. The\nservants always told me there was nothing left after a big party. There\nwere no invitations--the reception was announced in the papers, so any\none who felt he had the slightest claim upon the minister appeared at\nthe party. Some of the dresses were funny, but there was nothing\neccentric--no women in hats, carrying babies in their arms, such as one\nused to see in the old days in America at the President's reception at\nthe White House, Washington--some very simple black silk dresses hardly\nlow--and of course a great many pretty women very well dressed. Some of\nmy American friends often came with true American curiosity, wanting to\nsee a phase of French life which was quite novel to them.\n\nW. remained two years as Minister of Public Instruction, and my life\nbecame at once very interesting, very full. We didn't live at the\nministry--it was not really necessary. All the work was over before\ndinner, except the \"signatures,\" which W. could do just as well in his\nlibrary at home. We went over and inspected the Hotel du Ministere in\nthe rue de Grenelle before we made our final decision, but it was not\nreally tempting. There were fine reception-rooms and a pretty garden,\nbut the living-rooms were small, not numerous, and decidedly gloomy. Of\ncourse I saw much less of W. He never came home to breakfast, except on\nSunday, as it was too far from the rue de Grenelle to the Etoile. The\nArc de Triomphe stands in the Place de l'Etoile at the top of the\nChamps-Elysees. All the great avenues, Alma, Jena, Kleber, and the\nadjacent streets are known as the Quartier de l'Etoile. It was before\nthe days of telephones, so whenever an important communication was to be\nmade to him when he was at home in the evening, a dragoon galloped up\nwith his little black bag from which he extracted his papers. It made\nquite an excitement in our quiet street the first time he arrived after\nten o'clock. We just managed our morning ride, and then there were often\npeople waiting to speak to W. before we started, and always when he came\nback. There was a great amount of patronage attached to his ministry,\nnominations to all the universities, lycees, schools, etc., and, what\nwas most agreeable to me, boxes at all the government theatres,--the\nGrand Opera, Opera Comique, Francais, Odeon, and Conservatoire. Every\nMonday morning we received the list for the week, and, after making\nour own selection, distributed them to the official world\ngenerally,--sometimes to our own personal friends. The boxes of the\nFrancais, Opera, and Conservatoire were much appreciated.\n\nI went very regularly to the Sunday afternoon concerts at the\nConservatoire, where all classical music was splendidly given. They\nconfined themselves generally to the strictly classic, but were\nbeginning to play a little Schumann that year. Some of the faces of the\nregular habitues became most familiar to me. There were three or four\nold men with grey hair sitting in the first row of stalls (most\nuncomfortable seats) who followed every note of the music, turning\naround and frowning at any unfortunate person in a box who dropped a fan\nor an opera-glass. It was funny to hear the hum of satisfaction when any\nwell-known movement of Beethoven or Mozart was attacked. The orchestra\nwas perfect, at its best I think in the \"scherzos\" which they took in\nbeautiful style--so light and sure. I liked the instrumental part much\nbetter than the singing. French voices, the women's particularly, are\nthin, as a rule. I think they sacrifice too much to the\n\"diction,\"--don't bring out the voices enough--but the style and\ntraining are perfect of their kind.\n\nThe Conservatoire is quite as much a social feature as a school of\nmusic. It was the thing to do on Sunday afternoon. No invitation was\nmore appreciated, as it was almost impossible to have places unless one\nwas invited by a friend. All the boxes and seats (the hall is small)\nbelong to subscribers and have done so for one or two generations. Many\nmarriages are made there. There are very few theatres in Paris to which\ngirls can be taken, but the Opera Comique and the Conservatoire are very\nfavourite resorts. When a marriage is pending the young lady, very well\ndressed (always in the simplest tenue de jeune fille) is taken to the\nConservatoire or the Opera Comique by her father and mother, and very\noften her grandmother. She sits in front of the box and the young man in\nthe stalls, where he can study his future wife without committing\nhimself. The difference of dress between the jeune fille and the jeune\nfemme is very strongly marked in France. The French girl never wears\nlace or jewels or feathers or heavy material of any kind, quite unlike\nher English or American contemporaries, who wear what they like. The\nwedding-dress is classic, a simple, very long dress of white satin, and\ngenerally a tulle veil over the face. When there is a handsome lace veil\nin the family, the bride sometimes wears it, but no lace on her dress.\nThe first thing the young married woman does is to wear a very long\nvelvet dress with feathers in her hair.\n\nI think on the whole the arranged marriages turn out as well as any\nothers. They are generally made by people of the same monde, accustomed\nto the same way of living, and the fortunes as nearly alike as possible.\nEverything is calculated. The young couple usually spend the summer with\nparents or parents-in-law, in the chateau, and I know some cases where\nthere are curious details about the number of lamps that can be lighted\nin their rooms, and the use of the carriage on certain days. I am\nspeaking of course of purely French marriages. To my American ideas it\nseemed very strange when I first came to Europe, but a long residence in\na foreign country certainly modifies one's impressions. Years ago, when\nwe were living in Rome, four sisters, before any of us were married, a\ncharming Frenchwoman, Duchesse de B., who came often to the house, was\nvery worried about this family of girls, all very happy at home and\ncontented with their lives. It was quite true we danced and hunted and\nmade a great deal of music, without ever troubling ourselves about the\nfuture. The duchesse couldn't understand it, used often to talk to\nmother very seriously. She came one day with a proposal of marriage--a\ncharming man, a Frenchman, not too young, with a good fortune, a title,\nand a chateau, had seen Madam King's daughters in the ballroom and\nhunting-field, and would very much like to be presented and make his\ncour. \"Which one?\" we naturally asked, but the answer was vague. It\nsounded so curiously impersonal that we could hardly take it seriously.\nHowever, we suggested that the young man should come and each one of the\nfour would show off her particular talent. One would play and one would\nsing (rather like the song in the children's book, \"one could dance and\none could sing, and one could play the violin\"), and the third, the\npolyglot of the family, could speak several languages. We were rather\npuzzled as to what my eldest sister could do, as she was not very\nsociable and never spoke to strangers if she could help it, so we\ndecided she must be very well dressed and preside at the tea-table\nbehind an old-fashioned silver urn that we always used--looking like a\nstately maitresse de maison receiving her guests. We confided all these\nplans to the duchesse, but she was quite put out with us, wouldn't bring\nthe young man nor tell us his name. We never knew who he was. Since I\nhave been a Frenchwoman (devant la loi)--I think all Americans remain\nAmerican no matter where they marry,--I have interested myself three or\nfour times in made marriages, which have generally turned out well.\nThere were very few Americans married in France all those years, now\nthere are legions of all kinds. I don't remember any in the official\nparliamentary world I lived in the first years of my marriage--nor\nEnglish either. It was absolutely French, and rather borne French. Very\nfew of the people, the women especially, had any knowledge or experience\nof foreign countries, and didn't care to have,--France was enough\nfor them.\n\nW. was very happy at the Ministry of Public Instruction,--all the\neducational questions interested him so much and the tournees en\nprovince and visits to the big schools and universities,--some of them,\nin the south of France particularly, singularly wanting in the most\nelementary details of hygiene and cleanliness, and it was very difficult\nto make the necessary changes, giving more light, air, and space.\nRoutine is a powerful factor in this very conservative country, where so\nmany things exist simply because they have always existed. Some of his\nletters from Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Montpellier were most interesting.\nAs a rule he was very well received and got on very well, strangely\nenough, with the clergy, particularly the haut clerge, bishops and\ncardinals. His being a Protestant was rather a help to him; he could\ntake an impartial view of things.\n\nAt Bordeaux he stayed at the Prefecture, where he was very comfortable,\nbut the days were fatiguing. He said he hadn't worked so hard for years.\nHe started at nine in the morning, visiting schools and universities,\ncame home to breakfast at twelve, and immediately after had a small\nreception, rectors, professors, and people connected with the schools he\nwanted to talk to, at three started again seeing more schools and going\nconscientiously over the buildings from basement to garret,--then visits\nto the cardinal, archbishop, general commanding, etc.--a big dinner and\nreception in the evening, the cardinal present in his red robes, his\ncoadjutor in purple, the officers in uniform, and all the people\nconnected in any way with the university, who were pleased to see their\nchief. There was a total absence of Bonapartist senators and deputies\n(which was not surprising, as W. had always been in violent opposition\nto the Empire), who were rather numerous in these parts. W. was really\nquite exhausted when he got back to Paris--said it was absolute luxury\nto sit quietly and read in his library, and not talk. It wasn't a luxury\nthat he enjoyed very much, for whenever he was in the house there was\nalways some one talking to him in his study and others waiting in the\ndrawing-room. Every minute of the day he was occupied. People were\nalways coming to ask for something for themselves or some members of\ntheir family, always candidates for the Institute, anxiously inquiring\nwhat their chances were, and if he had recommended them to his friends.\nIt is striking even in this country of functionaries (I think there are\nmore small public employees in France than in any other country) how\nmany applicants there were always for the most insignificant places--a\nFrenchman loves a cap with gold braid and gilt buttons on his coat.\n\nAll the winter of 1876, which saw the end of the National Assembly and\nthe beginning of a new regime, was an eventful one in parliamentary\ncircles. I don't know if the country generally was very much excited\nabout a new constitution and a change of government. I don't think the\ncountry in France (the small farmers and peasants) are ever much excited\nabout the form of government. As long as the crops are good and there is\nno war to take away their sons and able-bodied men, they don't care,\noften don't know, whether a king or an emperor is reigning over them.\nThey say there are some far-off villages half hidden in the forests and\nmountains who still believe that a king and a Bourbon is reigning in\nFrance. Something had to be decided; the provisoire could no longer\ncontinue; the country could not go on without a settled government. All\nthe arguments and negotiations of that period have been so often told,\nthat I will not go into any details. The two centres, centre droit and\ncentre gauche, had everything in their hands as the great moderating\nelements of the Assembly, but the conflicting claims of the various\nparties, Legitimist, Orleanist, Bonapartist, and advanced Left, made the\nquestion a very difficult one.\n\nW. as a member of the Comite des Trente was very much occupied and\npreoccupied. He came back generally very late from Versailles, and, when\nhe did dine at home, either went out again after dinner to some of the\nnumerous meetings at different houses or had people at home. I think the\ngreat majority of deputies were honestly trying to do what they thought\nbest for the country, and when one remembers the names and personalities\non both sides--MacMahon, Broglie, d'Audiffret-Pasquier, Buffet, Dufaure,\nand Thiers, Casimir Perier, Leon Say, Jules Simon, Jules Ferry,\nFreycinet, and many others, it is impossible to think that any of those\nmen were animated by any spirit other than love of the country and an\nardent desire to see some stable government restored which would enable\nFrance to take her place again among the great powers. Unfortunately the\ndifference of opinion as to the form of government made things very\ndifficult. Some of the young deputies, just fresh from the war and\nsmarting under a sense of humiliation, were very violent in their abuse\nof any Royalist and particularly Bonapartist restoration.\n\n[Illustration: Meeting of officers of the National Assembly, and of\ndelegates of the new Chambers, in the salon of Hercules, palace of\nVersailles. From _L'Illustration_, March 11. 1876.]\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nTHE SOCIAL SIDE OF A MINISTER'S WIFE\n\nMy first big dinner at the Ministry of Public Instruction rather\nintimidated me. We were fifty people--I the only lady. I went over to\nthe ministry in the afternoon to see the table, which was very well\narranged with quantities of flowers, beautiful Sevres china, not much\nsilver--there is very little left in France, it having all been melted\nat the time of the Revolution. The official dinners are always well done\nin Paris. I suppose the traditions of the Empire have been handed down.\nWe arrived a few minutes before eight, all the staff and directors\nalready there, and by ten minutes after eight every one had arrived. I\nsat between Gerome, the painter, and Renan, two very different men but\neach quite charming,--Gerome tall, slight, animated, talking very easily\nabout everything. He told me who a great many of the people were, with a\nlittle commentary on their profession and career which was very useful\nto me, as I knew so few of them. Renan was short, stout, with a very\nlarge head, almost unprepossessing-looking, but with a great charm of\nmanner and the most delightful smile and voice imaginable. He often\ndined with us in our own house, en petit comite, and was always\ncharming. He was one of those happy mortals (there are not many) who\nmade every subject they discuss interesting.\n\nAfter that first experience, I liked the big men's dinners very much.\nThere was no general conversation; I talked exclusively to my two\nneighbours, but as they were always distinguished in some branch of art,\nscience, or literature, the talk was brilliant, and I found the hour our\ndinner lasted a very short one. W. was very particular about not having\nlong dinners. Later, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where we\nsometimes had eighty guests, the dinner was never over an hour. I did\nnot remain the whole evening at the men's dinners. As soon as they\ndispersed to talk and smoke, I came away, leaving W. to entertain his\nguests. We often had big receptions with music and comedie. At one of\nour first big parties we had several of the Orleans family. I was rather\nnervous, as I had never received royalty,--in fact I had never spoken to\na royal prince or princess. I had lived a great deal in Rome, as a girl,\nduring the last days of Pius IX, and I was never in Paris during the\nEmpire. When we went back to Rome one winter, after the accession of\nKing Victor Emmanuel, I found myself for the first time in a room with\nroyalties, the Prince and Princesse de Piemont. I remember quite well\nbeing so surprised by seeing two of the Roman men we knew very well come\nbackward into the ballroom where we were sitting. I thought they must be\nanticipating the Mardi Gras and were masquerading a little, didn't\nrealise that every one was standing. I remained sitting for a moment\n(much to the horror of one of the English secretaries who was with us\nand who thought we were going to make a spread-eagle American\ndemonstration and remain sitting when royalty appeared). However, by\nsome sort of instinct, we rose too (perhaps to see what was going on),\njust as the princes passed. Princess Marguerite looked charming, dressed\nin white, with her splendid pearls and beautiful fair hair.\n\nWhen it was decided that we should ask the Orleans princes to our party,\nI thought I would go to see the Duc Decazes, the foreign minister, a\ncharming man and charming colleague, to get some precise information\nabout my part of the entertainment. He couldn't think what I wanted when\nI invaded his cabinet, and was much amused when I stated my case.\n\n\"There is nothing unusual in receiving the princes at a ministry. You\nmust do as you have always done.\"\n\n\"But that is just the question, I have _never done_. I have never in my\nlife exchanged a word with a royal personage.\"\n\n\"It is not possible!\"\n\n\"It is absolutely true; I have never lived anywhere where there was a\ncourt.\"\n\nWhen he saw that I was in earnest he was as nice as possible, told me\n_exactly_ what I wanted to know,--that I need not say \"Altesse royale\"\nevery time I spoke, merely occasionally, as they all like it,--that I\nmust speak in the third person, \"Madame veut-elle,\" \"Monseigneur veut-il\nme permettre,\" etc., also that I must always be at the door when a\nprincess arrived and conduct her myself to her seat.\n\n\"But if I am at one end of the long enfilade of rooms taking the\nComtesse de Paris to her seat and another princess (Joinville or\nChartres) should arrive; what has to be done?\"\n\n\"Your husband must always be at the door with his chef de cabinet, who\nwill replace him while he takes the princess to her place.\"\n\nThe Marquise de L., a charming old lady with white hair, beautiful blue\neyes, and pink cheeks, a great friend of the Orleans family, went with\nme when I made my round of visits to thank the royal ladies for\naccepting our invitation. We found no one but the Princesse Marguerite,\ndaughter of the Duc de Nemours, who was living at Neuilly. I had all my\ninstructions from the marquise, how many courtesies to make, how to\naddress her, and above all not to speak until the princess spoke to me.\nWe were shown into a pretty drawing-room, opening on a garden, where the\nprincess was waiting, standing at one end of the room. Madame de L.\nnamed me, I made my courtesies, the princess shook hands, and then we\nremained standing, facing each other. She didn't say anything. I stood\nperfectly straight and quiet, waiting. She changed colour, moved her\nhands nervously, was evidently overcome with shyness, but didn't utter a\nsound. It seemed very long, was really only a few seconds, but I was\ngetting rather nervous when suddenly a child ran across the garden. That\nbroke the ice and she asked me the classic royal question, \"Avez-vous\ndes enfants, madame?\" I had only one, and he was rather small, but still\nhis nurse, his teeth, and his food carried me on for a little while and\nafter that we had some general conversation, but I can't say the visit\nwas really interesting. As long as I was in public life I regretted\nthat I had but the one child,--children and nurseries and schoolrooms\nwere always an unfailing topic of conversation. Frenchwomen of all\nclasses take much more interest in the details of their nurseries and\nthe education and bringing-up of their children than we Anglo-Saxons do.\nI know several mammas who followed all the course of their sons' studies\nwhen they were preparing their baccalaureat, even to writing the\ncompositions. The head nurse (English) who takes entire charge of her\nnursery, who doesn't like any interference, and brings the children to\ntheir mother at stated hours, doesn't exist in France.\n\nOur party was very brilliant, all sorts of notabilities of all kinds,\nand the leading Paris artists from the Grand Opera, Opera Comique, and\nthe Francais. As soon as the performance was over W. told me I must go\nand thank the artists; he could not leave his princes. I started off to\nthe last of the long suite of salons where they were all assembled.\nComte de L., W.'s chef de cabinet, went with me, and we were preceded by\na huissier with sword and chain, who piloted us through the crowd. I\nfelt very shy when I arrived in the greenroom. The artists were drawn up\nin two rows, the women on one side, the men on the other, all eyes of\ncourse fixed upon madame la ministresse. Madame Carvalho, Sarah\nBernhardt, and Croizette were standing at the head of the long line of\nwomen; Faure, Talazac, Delaunay, Coquelin, on the other side. I went\nfirst all along the line of women, then came back by the men. I realised\ninstantly after the first word of thanks and interest how easy it is for\nprinces, or any one in high places, to give pleasure. They all responded\nso smilingly and naturally to everything I said. After the first two or\nthree words, I didn't mind at all, and found myself discussing\nacoustics, the difficulty of playing any well-known part without\ncostumes, scenery, etc., the inconvenience of having the public so near,\nquite easily. We often had music and recitations at our parties, and\nthat was always a great pleasure to me. I remember so well one evening\nwhen we had the chorus of the Conservatoire and they sang quite\nbeautifully the old \"Plaisirs d'Amour\" of our childhood. It had a great\nsuccess and they were obliged to repeat it. W. made one great innovation\nin the dress of the ladies of the Conservatoire chorus. They were always\ndressed in white, which was very well for the young, slight figures, but\nwas less happy for a stout middle-aged lady. So after much discussion it\nwas decided to adopt black as the official dress and I must say it was\nan enormous improvement.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SOCIAL SIDE\n\nAll sorts of interesting people came to see us at the Ministry of Public\nInstruction,--among others the late Emperor of Brazil, Don Pedro de\nBragance, who spent some months in Paris that year with his daughter,\nthe young Comtesse d'Eu. He was a tall, good-looking man, with a\ncharming easy manner, very cultivated and very keen about\neverything--art, literature, politics. His gentlemen said he had the\nenergy of a man of twenty-five, and he was well over middle age when he\nwas in Paris. They were quite exhausted sometimes after a long day of\nvisits and sightseeing with him. He was an early riser. One of the first\nrendezvous he gave W. was at nine o'clock in the morning, which greatly\ndisturbed that gentleman's habits. He was never an early riser, worked\nalways very late (said his best despatches were written after midnight),\nand didn't care about beginning his day too early. Another interesting\npersonality was Mommsen, the German historian and savant. He was a\npicturesque-looking old man with keen blue eyes and a quantity of white\nhair. I don't think anything modern interested him very much. He was an\nold man when I first saw him, and looked even older than his age. He and\nW. used to plunge into very long, learned discussions over antiquities\nand medals. W. said the hours with Mommsen rested him, such a change\nfrom the \"shop\" talk always mixed with politics in France.\n\nWe often had political breakfasts at home (more breakfasts than\ndinners). Our Aisne deputies and senators were not very mondains, didn't\ncare much to dine out. They were pleasant enough when they talked about\nsubjects that interested them. Henri Martin, senator of the Aisne, was\nan old-fashioned Republican, absolutely convinced that no other\ngovernment would ever succeed in France, but he was moderate. St.\nVallier, also a senator from the Aisne, was nervous and easily\ndiscouraged when things didn't go smoothly, but he too thought the\nRepublic was the only possible government now, whatever his preferences\nmight have been formerly.\n\nW.'s ministry came to an end on the famous 16th of May, 1877, when\nMarshal MacMahon suddenly took matters in his own hands and dismissed\nhis cabinet presided over by M. Jules Simon. Things had not been going\nsmoothly for some time, could not between two men of such absolute\ndifference of origin, habits, and ideas. Still, the famous letter\nwritten by the marshal to Jules Simon was a thunderclap. I was walking\nabout the Champs-Elysees and Faubourg St. Honore on the morning of the\n16th of May, and saw all the carriages, our own included, waiting at the\nMinistry of the Interior, where the conseil was sitting. I went home to\nbreakfast, thought W. was later than usual, but never dreamed of what\nwas happening. When he finally appeared, quite composed and smiling,\nwith his news, \"We are out of office; the marshal has sent us all about\nour business,\" I could hardly believe it, even when he told me all the\ndetails. I had known for a long time that things were not going well,\nbut there were always so much friction and such opposing elements in the\ncabinet that I had not attached much importance to the accounts of\nstormy sittings and thought things would settle down.\n\n[Illustration: Theodor Mommsen. From a painting by Franz von Lenbach.]\n\nW. said the marshal was very civil to him, but it was evident that he\ncould not stand Jules Simon any longer and the various measures that he\nfelt were impending. We had many visitors after breakfast, all much\nexcited, wondering what the next step would be--if the Chambers would be\ndissolved, the marshal trying to impose a cabinet of the Right or\nperhaps form another moderate liberal cabinet without Jules Simon, but\nretaining some of his ministers. It was my reception afternoon, and\nwhile I was sitting quietly in my drawing-room talking to some of my\nfriends, making plans for the summer, quite pleased to have W. to\nmyself again, the butler hurried into the room telling me that the\nMarechale de MacMahon was on the stairs, coming to make me a visit. I\nwas very much surprised, as she never came to see me. We met very\nrarely, except on official occasions, and she made no secret of her\ndislike to the official Republican ladies (but she was always absolutely\ncorrect if not enthusiastic). I had just time to get to the head of the\nstairs to receive her. She was very amiable, a little embarrassed, took\na cup of tea--said the marshal was very sorry to part with W., he had\nnever had any trouble or disagreement with him of any kind, but that it\nwas impossible to go on with a cabinet when neither party had any\nconfidence in the other. I quite agreed, said it was the fortunes of\nwar; I hoped the marshal would find another premier who would be more\nsympathetic with him, and then we talked of other things.\n\nMy friends were quite amused. One of them, Marquise de T., knew the\nMarechale quite well, and said she was going to ask her if she was\nobliged to make visites de condoleance to the wives of all the fallen\nministers. W. was rather astonished when I told him who had come to tea\nwith me, and thought the conversation must have been difficult. I told\nhim, not at all, once the necessary phrases about the departing\nministers were over. The piano was open, music littered about; she was\nfond of music and she admired very much a portrait of father as a boy in\nthe Harrow dress, asked who it was and what the dress was. She was a\nperfect woman of the world, and no one was uncomfortable.\n\nIt seemed quite strange and very pleasant to take up my old life again\nafter two years of public life. W. breakfasted at home, went to the\nSenate every day and to the Institute on Fridays and we dined with our\nfriends and had small dinners in our own house instead of official\nbanquets at all the ministries (usually from Potel and Chabot at so much\na head). Politics were very lively all summer. The Chambers were\ndissolved almost at once after the constitution of the new cabinet,\npresided over by the Duc de Broglie. It was evident from the first\nmoment that the new ministry wouldn't, couldn't live. (The Duc de\nBroglie was quite aware of the fact. His first words on taking office\nwere: \"On nous a jetes a l'eau, maintenant il faut nager.\") He made a\nvery good fight, but he had that worst of all faults for a leader, he\nwas unpopular. He was a brilliant, cultured speaker, but had a curt,\ndictatorial manner, with an air always of looking down upon his public.\nSo different from his colleague, the Duc Decazes, whose charming,\ncourteous manners and nice blue eyes made him friends even among his\nadversaries. There is a well-known story told of the two dukes which\nshows exactly the personality of the men. Some one, a deputy I think,\nwanted something very much which either of the gentlemen could give. He\nwent first to the Duc Decazes, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, who\nreceived him charmingly, was most kind and courteous, but didn't do what\nthe man wanted. He then went to the Duc de Broglie, President du\nConseil, who was busy, received him very curtly, cut short his\nexplanations, and was in fact extremely disagreeable but did the thing,\nand the man loved Decazes and hated de Broglie. All sorts of rumours\nwere afloat; we used to hear the wildest stories and plans. One day W.\ncame in looking rather preoccupied. There was an idea that the Right\nwere going to take most stringent measures, arrest all the ministers,\nmembers of Jules Simon's cabinet, many of the prominent Liberals. He\nsaid it was quite possible and then gave me various instructions. I was\nabove all to make no fuss if they really came to arrest him. He showed\nme where all his keys, papers, and money were, told me to go instantly\nto his uncle, Mr. Lutteroth, who lived next door. He was an old\ndiplomat, knew everybody, and would give me very good advice. I did not\nfeel very happy, but like so many things that are foretold, nothing\never happened.\n\nAnother rumour, from the extreme Left this time, was that a large armed\nforce under the command of a well-known general, very high up in his\ncareer, was to assemble in the north at Lille, a strong contingent of\nRepublicans were to join them to be ready to act. I remember quite well\ntwo of W.'s friends coming in one morning, full of enthusiasm for this\nplan. I don't think they quite knew what they were going to do with\ntheir army. W. certainly did not. He listened to all the details of the\nplan; they gave him the name of the general, supposed to have very\nRepublican sympathies (not generally the case with officers), the number\nof regiments, etc., who would march at a given signal, but when he said,\n\"It is possible, you might get a certain number of men together, but\nwhat would you do with them?\" they were rather nonplussed. They hadn't\ngot any further than a grand patriotic demonstration, with the military,\ndrums beating, flags flying, and the Marseillaise being howled by an\nexcited crowd. No such extreme measures, however, were ever carried\nout. From the first moment it was evident that a large Republican\nmajority would be returned; almost all the former deputies were\nre-elected and a number of new ones, more advanced in their opinion. In\nthe country it was the only topic of conversation.\n\nParliament was dissolved in June, 1877, but we remained in town until\nthe end of July. It wasn't very warm and many people remained until the\nend of the session. The big schools too only break up on the 15th of\nJuly, and many parents remain in Paris. The Republican campaign had\nalready begun, and there were numerous little dinners and meetings when\nplans and possibilities were discussed. W. got back usually very late\nfrom Versailles. When he knew the sitting would be very late he sent me\nword and I used to go and dine with mother, but sometimes he was kept on\nthere from hour to hour. I had some long waits before we could dine, and\nHubert, the coachman, used to spend hours in the courtyard of the Gare\nSt. Lazare waiting for his master. We had a big bay mare, a very fast\ntrotter, which always did the train service, and the two were stationed\nthere sometimes from six-thirty to nine-thirty, but they never seemed\nthe worse for it. W., though a very considerate man for his servants\ngenerally, never worried at all about keeping his coachmen and horses\nwaiting. He said the coachmen were the most warmly dressed men in Paris,\nalways took care to be well covered, and we never had fancy,\nhigh-stepping horses, but ordinary strong ones, which could wait\npatiently. W. said the talk in the Chambers and in the lobbies was quite\nwild--every sort of extravagant proposition was made. There were many\nconferences with the Duc d'Audiffret-Pasquier, Duc de Broglie--with\nCasimir Perier, Leon Say, Gambetta, Jules Ferry, and Freycinet--where\nthe best men on both sides tried hard to come to an agreement. W. went\nseveral times in August to see M. Thiers, who was settled at St.\nGermain. The old statesman was as keen as ever, receiving every day all\nsorts of deputations, advising, warning, encouraging, and quite\nconfident as to the result of the elections. People were looking to him\nas the next President, despite his great age. However, he was not\ndestined to see the triumph of his ideas. He died suddenly at St.\nGermain on the 3d of September. W. said his funeral was a remarkable\nsight--thousands of people followed the cortege--all Paris showing a\nlast respect to the liberateur du territoire (though there were still\nclubs where he was spoken of as le sinistre vieillard). In August W.\nwent to his Conseil-General at Laon, and I went down to my\nbrother-in-law's place at St. Leger near Rouen. We were a very happy\ncosmopolitan family-party. My mother-in-law was born a Scotch-woman\n(Chisholm). She was a fine type of the old-fashioned cultivated lady,\nwith a charming polite manner, keenly interested in all that was going\non in the world. She was an old lady when I married, and had outlived\nalmost all her contemporaries, but she had a beautiful old age,\nsurrounded by children and grandchildren. She had lived through many\nvicissitudes from the time of her marriage, when she arrived at the\nChateau of St. Remy in the Department of Eure-et-Loire (where my\nhusband, her eldest son, was born), passing through triumphal arches\nerected in honour of the young bride, to the last days when the fortunes\nof the family were diminished by revolutions and political and business\ncrises in France. They moved from St. Remy, selling the chateau, and\nbuilt a house on the top of a green hill near Rouen, quite shut in by\nbig trees, and with a lovely view from the Rond Point--the highest part\nof the garden, over Rouen--with the spires of the cathedral in the\ndistance. I used to find her every morning when I went to her room,\nsitting at the window, her books and knitting on a table near--looking\ndown on the lawn and the steep winding path that came up from the\ngarden,--where she had seen three generations of her dear ones pass\nevery day--first her husband, then her sons--now her grandsons. My\nsister-in-law, R.'s wife, was also an Englishwoman; the daughter of the\nhouse had married her cousin, de Bunsen, who had been a German\ndiplomatist, and who had made nearly all his career in Italy, at the\nmost interesting period of her history, when she was struggling for\nemancipation from the Austrian rule and independence. I was an American,\nquite a new element in the family circle. We had many and most animated\ndiscussions over all sorts of subjects, in two or three languages, at\nthe tea-table under the big tree on the lawn. French and English were\nalways going, and often German, as de Bunsen always spoke to his\ndaughter in German. My mother-in-law, who knew three or four languages,\ndid not at all approve of the careless habit we had all got into of\nmixing our languages and using French or Italian words when we were\nspeaking English--if they came more easily. She made a rule that we\nshould use only one language at meals--she didn't care which one, but we\nmust keep to it. My brother-in-law was standing for the deputation. We\ndidn't see much of him in the daytime--his electors and his visits and\nspeeches and banquets de pompiers took up all his time. The beginning\nof his career had been very different. He was educated in England--Rugby\nand Woolwich--and served several years in the Royal Artillery in the\nBritish army. His military training was very useful to him during the\nFranco-Prussian War, when he equipped and commanded a field battery,\nmaking all the campaign. His English brother officers always remembered\nhim. Many times when we were living in England at the embassy, I was\nasked about him. A curious thing happened in the House of Lords one day,\nshowing the wonderful memory of princes for faces. R. was staying with\nus for a few days, when the annual debate over the bill for marriage of\na deceased wife's sister came up. The Prince of Wales (late King Edward)\nand all the other princes were present in the House. R. was there too,\nstanding where all the strangers do, at the entrance of the lobby. When\nthe debate was over, the Prince of Wales left. As he passed along, he\nshook hands with several gentlemen also standing near the lobby,\nincluding R. He stopped a moment in front of him, saying: \"I think this\nis Mr. Waddington. The last time I saw you, you wore Her Majesty's\nuniform.\" He hadn't seen him for twenty-five or thirty years. I asked\nthe prince afterward how he recognised him. He said he didn't know; it\nwas perhaps noticing an unfamiliar face in the group of men standing\nthere,--and something recalled his brother, the ambassador.\n\nIn September we went down to Bourneville and settled ourselves there for\nthe autumn. W. was standing for the Senate with the Count de St. Vallier\nand Henri Martin. They all preferred being named in their department,\nwhere everybody knew them and their personal influence could make itself\nmore easily felt. W.'s campaign was not very arduous. All the people\nknew him and liked him--knew that he would do whatever he promised.\nTheir programme was absolutely Republican, but moderate, and he only\nmade a few speeches and went about the country a little. I often went\nwith him when he rode, and some of our visits to the farmers and local\nauthorities were amusing if not encouraging. We were always very well\nreceived, but it wasn't easy to find out what they really thought (if\nthey did think about it at all) of the state of affairs. The small\nlandowners particularly, the men who had one field and a garden, were\nvery reserved. They listened attentively enough to all W. had to say. He\nwas never long, never personal, and never abused his adversaries, but\nthey rarely expressed an opinion. They almost always turned the\nconversation upon some local matter or petty grievance. It didn't seem\nto me that they took the slightest interest in the extraordinary changes\nthat were going on in France. A great many people came to see W. and\nthere would be a curious collection sometimes in his library at the end\nof the day. The doctor (who always had precise information--country\ndoctors always have--they see a great many people and I fancy the women\ntalk to them and tell them what their men are doing), one or two\nfarmers, some schoolmasters, the mayors of the nearest villages, the\ncaptains of the firemen and of the archers (they still shoot with bow\nand arrow in our part of the country; every Sunday the men practise\nshooting at a target)--the gendarmes, very useful these too to bring\nnews--the notary, and occasionally a sous-prefet, but then he was a\npersonage, representing the Government, and was treated with more\nceremony than the other visitors. It was evident from all these sources\nthat the Republicans were coming to the front en masse.\n\nThe Republicans (for once) were marvellously disciplined and kept\ntogether. It was really wonderful when one thought of all the different\nelements that were represented in the party. There was quite as much\ndifference between the quiet moderate men of the Left Centre and the\nextreme Left as there was between the Legitimists and any faction of the\nRepublican party. There was a strong feeling among the Liberals that\nthey were being coerced, that arbitrary measures, perhaps a coup d'etat,\nwould be sprung upon them, and they were quite determined to resist. I\ndon't think there was ever any danger of a coup d'etat, at least as long\nas Marshal MacMahon was the chief of state. He was a fine honourable,\npatriotic soldier, utterly incapable of an illegality of any kind. He\ndidn't like the Republic, honestly thought it would never succeed with\nthe Republicans (la Republique sans Republicains was for him its only\nchance)--and he certainly had illusions and thought his friends and\nadvisers would succeed in making and keeping a firm conservative\ngovernment. How far that illusion was shared by his entourage it is\ndifficult to say. They fought their battle well--government pressure\nexercised in all ways. Prefets and sous-prefets changed, wonderful\nprospects of little work and high pay held out to doubtful electors, and\nthe same bright illusive promises made to the masses, which all parties\nmake in all elections and which the people believe each time. The\nRepublicans were not idle either, and many fiery patriotic speeches\nwere made or their side. Gambetta always held his public with his\npassionate, earnest declamation, and his famous phrase, that the marshal\nmust \"se soumettre ou se demettre,\" became a password all through\nthe country.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nA REPUBLICAN VICTORY AND A NEW MINISTRY\n\nThe elections took place in October-November, 1877, and gave at once a\ngreat Republican majority. W. and his two colleagues, Count de St.\nVallier and Henri Martin, had an easy victory, but a great many of their\npersonal friends, moderates, were beaten. The centres were decidedly\nweaker in the new Chambers. There was not much hope left of uniting the\ntwo centres, Droite et Gauche, in the famous \"fusion\" which had been a\ndream of the moderate men.\n\nThe new Chambers assembled at Versailles in November. The Broglie\ncabinet was out, but a new ministry of the Right faced the new\nParliament. Their life was very short and stormy; they were really dead\nbefore they began to exist and in December the marshal sent for M.\nDufaure and charged him to form a Ministere de Gauche. None of his\npersonal friends, except General Borel at the War Office, was in the new\ncombination. W. was named to the Foreign Office. I was rather\ndisappointed when he came home and told me he had accepted that\nportfolio. I thought his old ministry, Public Instruction, suited him so\nwell, the work interested him, was entirely to his taste. He knew all\nthe literary and educational world, not only in France but everywhere\nelse--England, of course, where he had kept up with many of his\nCambridge comrades, and Germany, where he also had literary connections.\nHowever, that wide acquaintance and his perfect knowledge of English and\nEnglish people helped him very much at once, not only at the Quai\nd'Orsay, but in all the years he was in England as ambassador.\n\nThe new ministry, with Dufaure as President of the Council, Leon Say at\nthe Finances, M. de Freycinet at Public Works, and W. at the Foreign\nOffice was announced the 14th of December, 1877. The preliminaries had\nbeen long and difficult--the marshal and his friends on one side--the\nRepublicans and Gambetta on the other--the moderates trying to keep\nthings together. Personally, I was rather sorry W. had agreed to be a\nmember of the cabinet; I was not very keen about official life and\nforesaw a great deal that would be disagreeable. Politics played such a\npart in social life. All the \"society,\" the Faubourg St. Germain (which\nrepresents the old names and titles of France), was violently opposed to\nthe Republic. I was astonished the first years of my married life in\nFrance, to see people of certain position and standing give the cold\nshoulder to men they had known all their lives because they were\nRepublicans, knowing them quite well to be honourable, independent\ngentlemen, wanting nothing from the Republic--merely trying to do their\nbest for the country. I only realised by degrees that people held off a\nlittle from me sometimes, as the wife of a Republican deputy. I didn't\ncare particularly, as I had never lived in France, and knew very few\npeople, but it didn't make social relations very pleasant, and I should\nhave been better pleased if W. had taken no active part. However, that\nfeeling was only temporary. I soon became keenly interested in politics\n(I suppose it is in the blood--all the men in my family in America were\npoliticians) and in the discussion of the various questions which were\nrapidly changing France into something quite different. Whether the\nchange has been for the better it would be hard to say even now, after\nmore than thirty-five years of the Republic.\n\nFreycinet was a great strength. He was absolutely Republican, but\nmoderate--very clever and energetic, a great friend of Gambetta's--and\na beautiful speaker. I have heard men say who didn't care about him\nparticularly, and who were not at all of his way of thinking, that they\nwould rather not discuss with him. He was sure to win them over to his\ncause with his wonderful, clear persuasive arguments.\n\n[Illustration: Palace of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paris.]\n\nThe first days were very busy ones. W. had to see all his staff (a very\nlarge one) of the Foreign Office, and organise his own cabinet. He was\nout all day, until late in the evening, at the Quai d'Orsay; used to go\nover there about ten or ten-thirty, breakfast there, and get back for a\nvery late dinner, and always had a director or secretary working with\nhim at our own house after dinner. I went over three or four times to\ninspect the ministry, as I had a presentiment we should end by living\nthere. The house is large and handsome, with a fine staircase and large\nhigh rooms. The furniture of course was \"ministerial\"--stiff and\nheavy--gold-backed chairs and sofas standing in rows against the walls.\nThere were some good pictures, among others the \"Congres de Paris,\"\nwhich occupies a prominent place in one of the salons, and splendid\ntapestries. The most attractive thing was a fine large garden at the\nback, but, as the living-rooms were up-stairs, we didn't use it very\nmuch. The lower rooms, which opened on the gardens, were only used as\nreception-rooms. The minister's cabinet was also down-stairs,\ncommunicating by a small staircase with his bedroom, just overhead. The\nfront of the house looks on the Seine; we had always a charming view\nfrom the windows, at night particularly, when all the little steamers\n(mouches) were passing with their lights. I had of course to make\nacquaintance with all the diplomatic corps. I knew all the ambassadors\nand most of the ministers, but there were some representatives of the\nsmaller powers and South American Republics with whom I had never come\nin contact. Again I paid a formal official visit to the Marechale de\nMacMahon as soon as the ministry was announced. She was perfectly polite\nand correct, but one felt at once she hadn't the slightest sympathy for\nanything Republican, and we never got to know each other any better all\nthe months we were thrown together. We remained for several weeks at our\nown house, and then most reluctantly determined to install ourselves at\nthe ministry. W. worked always very late after dinner, and he felt it\nwas not possible to ask his directors, all important men of a certain\nage, to come up to the Quartier de l'Etoile at ten o'clock and keep them\nbusy until midnight. W.'s new chef de cabinet, Comte de Pontecoulant,\nwas very anxious that we should move, thought everything would be\nsimplified if W. were living over there. I had never known Pontecoulant\nuntil W. chose him as his chef de cabinet. He was a diplomatist with\nsome years of service behind him, and was perfectly au courant of all\nthe routine and habits of the Foreign Office. He paid me a short formal\nvisit soon after he had accepted the post; we exchanged a few remarks\nabout the situation, I hoped we would faire bon menage, and had no\nparticular impression of him except that he was very French and stiff; I\ndidn't suppose I should see much of him. It seems curious now to look\nback upon that first interview. We all became so fond of him, he was a\nloyal, faithful friend, was always ready to help me in any small\ndifficulties, and I went to him for everything--visits, servants,\nhorses, etc. W. had no time for any details or amenities of life. We\nmoved over just before New Year's day. As the gros mobilier was already\nthere, we only took over personal things, grand piano, screens, tables,\neasy chairs, and small ornaments and bibelots. These were all sent off\nin a van early one morning, and after luncheon I went over, having given\nrendezvous to Pontecoulant and M. Kruft, chef du materiel, an\nexcellent, intelligent man, who was most useful and devoted to me the\ntwo years I lived at the ministry. I was very depressed when we drove\ninto the courtyard. I had never lived on that side of the river, and\nfelt cut off from all my belongings,--the bridge a terror, so cold in\nwinter, so hot in summer,--I never got accustomed to it, never crossed\nit on foot. The sight of the great empty rooms didn't reassure me. The\nreception-rooms of course were very handsome. There were a great many\nservants, huissiers, and footmen standing about, and people waiting in\nthe big drawing-room to speak to W. The living-rooms up-stairs were\nghastly--looked bare and uncomfortable in the highest degree. They were\nlarge and high and looked down upon the garden, though that on a bleak\nDecember day was not very cheerful--but there were possibilities. Kruft\nwas very sympathetic, understood quite well how I felt, and was ready to\ndo anything in the way of stoves, baths, wardrobes in the lingerie, new\ncarpets, and curtains, that I wanted. Pontecoulant too was eminently\npractical, and I was quite amused to find myself discussing lingeries\nand bathrooms with a total stranger whom I had only seen twice in my\nlife. It took me about a week to get really settled. I went over every\nday, returning to my own house to eat and sleep. Kruft did wonders; the\nplace was quite transformed when I finally moved over. The rooms looked\nvery bright and comfortable when we arrived in the afternoon of the 31st\nof December (New Year's eve). The little end salon, which I made my\nboudoir, was hung with blue satin; my piano, screens, and little things\nwere very well placed--plenty of palms and flowers, bright fires\neverywhere--the bedrooms, nursery, and lingeries clean and bright. My\nbedroom opened on a large salon, where I received usually, keeping my\nboudoir for ourselves and our intimate friends. My special huissier,\nGerard, who sat all day outside of the salon door, was presented to me,\nand instantly became a most useful and important member of the\nhousehold--never forgot a name or a face, remembered what cards and\nnotes I had received, whether the notes were answered, or the bills\npaid, knew almost all my wardrobe, would bring me down a coat or a wrap\nif I wanted one suddenly down-stairs. I had frequent consultations with\nPontecoulant and Kruft to regulate all the details of the various\nservices before we were quite settled. We took over all our own servants\nand found many others who were on the permanent staff of the ministry,\nfootmen, huissiers, and odd men who attended to all the fires, opened\nand shut all the doors, windows, and shutters. It was rather difficult\nto organise the regular working service, there was such rivalry between\nour own personal servants and the men who belonged to the house, but\nafter a little while things went pretty smoothly. W. dined out the first\nnight we slept at the Quai d'Orsay, and about an hour after we had\narrived, while I was still walking about in my hat and coat, feeling\nvery strange in the big, high rooms, I was told that the lampiste was\nwaiting my orders (a few lamps had been lit in some of the rooms). I\ndidn't quite know what orders to give, hadn't mastered yet the number\nthat would be required; but I sent for him, said I should be alone for\ndinner, perhaps one or two lamps in the dining-room and small salon\nwould be enough. He evidently thought that was not at all sufficient,\nwanted something more precise, so I said to light as he had been\naccustomed to when the Duc Decazes and his family were dining alone\n(which I don't suppose they ever did, nor we either when we once took up\nour life). Such a blaze of light met my eyes when I went to dinner that\nI was quite bewildered--boudoir, billiard-room, dining-room (very large,\nthe small round table for one person hardly perceptible), and corridors\nall lighted \"a giorno.\" However, it looked very cheerful and kept me\nfrom feeling too dreadfully homesick for my own house and familiar\nsurroundings. The rooms were so high up that we didn't hear the noise of\nthe street, but the river looked alive and friendly with the lights on\nthe bridges, and a few boats still running.\n\nWe had much more receiving and entertaining to do at the Quai d'Orsay\nthan at any other ministry, and were obliged to go out much more\nourselves. The season in the official world begins with a reception at\nthe President's on New Year's day. The diplomatic corps and presidents\nof the Senate and Chamber go in state to the Elysee to pay their\nrespects to the chief of state--the ambassadors with all their staff in\nuniform in gala carriages. It is a pretty sight, and there are always a\ngood many people waiting in the Faubourg St. Honore to see the\ncarriages. The English carriage is always the best; they understand all\nthe details of harness and livery so much better than any one else. The\nmarshal and his family were established at the Elysee. It wasn't\npossible for him to remain at Versailles--he couldn't be so far from\nParis, where all sorts of questions were coming up every day, and he was\nobliged to receive deputations and reports, and see people of all kinds.\nThey were already agitating the question of the Parliament coming back\nto Paris. The deputies generally were complaining of the loss of time\nand the discomfort of the daily journey even in the parliamentary train.\nThe Right generally was very much opposed to having the Chambers back in\nParis. I never could understand why. I suppose they were afraid that a\nstormy sitting might lead to disturbances. In the streets of a big city\nthere is always a floating population ready to espouse violently any\ncause. At Versailles one was away from any such danger, and, except\nimmediately around the palace, there was nobody in the long, deserted\navenues. They often cited the United States, how no statesman after the\nsigning of the Declaration of Independence (in Philadelphia) would have\nventured to propose that the Parliament should sit in New York or\nPhiladelphia, but the reason there was very different; they were obliged\nto make a neutral zone, something between the North and the South. The\nDistrict of Columbia is a thing apart, belonging to neither side. It has\ncertainly worked very well in America. Washington is a fine city, with\nits splendid old trees and broad avenues. It has a cachet of its own, is\nunlike any other city I know in the world.\n\nThe marshal received at the Elysee every Thursday evening--he and his\nstaff in uniform, also all the officers who came, which made a brilliant\ngathering. Their big dinners and receptions were always extremely well\ndone. Except a few of their personal friends, not many people of society\nwere present--the diplomatic corps usually very well represented, the\nGovernment and their wives, and a certain number of liberal deputies--a\ngreat many officers. We received every fifteen days, beginning with a\nbig dinner. It was an open reception, announced in the papers. The\ndiplomats always mustered very strong, also the Parliament--not many\nwomen. Many of the deputies remained in the country, taking rooms merely\nwhile the Chambers were sitting, and their wives never appeared in\nParis. \"Society\" didn't come to us much either, except on certain\noccasions when we had a royal prince or some very distinguished\nforeigners. Besides the big official receptions, we often had small\ndinners up-stairs during the week. Some of these I look back to with\nmuch pleasure. I was generally the only lady with eight or ten men, and\nthe talk was often brilliant. Some of our habitues were the late Lord\nHoughton, a delightful talker; Lord Dufferin, then ambassador in St.\nPetersburg; Sir Henry Layard, British ambassador in Spain, an\ninteresting man who had been everywhere and seen and known everybody\nworth knowing in the world; Count Schouvaloff, Russian ambassador in\nLondon, a polished courtier, extremely intelligent; he and W. were\ncolleagues afterward at the Congres de Berlin, and W. has often told me\nhow brilliantly he defended his cause; General Ignatieff, Prince Orloff,\nthe nunzio Monsignor Czascki, quite charming, the type of the prelat\nmondain, very large (though very Catholic) in his ideas, but never\naggressive or disagreeable about the Republic, as so many of the clergy\nwere. He was very fond of music, and went with me sometimes to the\nConservatoire on Sunday; he had a great admiration for the way they\nplayed classical music; used to lean back in his chair in a corner\n(would never sit in front of the box) and drink in every sound.\n\nWe sometimes had informal music in my little blue salon. Baron de\nZuylen, Dutch minister, was an excellent musician, also Comte de Beust,\nthe Austrian ambassador. He was a composer. I remember his playing me\none day a wedding march he had composed for the marriage of one of the\narchdukes. It was very descriptive, with bells, cannon, hurrahs, and a\nnuptial hymn--rather difficult to render on a piano--but there was a\ncertain amount of imagination in the composition. The two came often\nwith me to the Conservatoire. Comte de Beust brought Liszt to me one\nday. I wanted so much to see that complex character, made up of\nenthusiasms of all kinds, patriotic, religious, musical. He was dressed\nin the ordinary black priestly garb, looked like an ascetic with pale,\nthin face, which lighted up very much when discussing any subject that\ninterested him. He didn't say a word about music, either then or on a\nsubsequent occasion when I lunched with him at the house of a great\nfriend and admirer, who was a beautiful musician. I hoped he would play\nafter luncheon. He was a very old man, and played rarely in those days,\nbut one would have liked to hear him. Madame M. thought he would perhaps\nfor her, if the party were not too large, and the guests \"sympathetic\"\nto him. I have heard so many artists say it made all the difference to\nthem when they felt the public was with them--if there were one\nunsympathetic or criticising face in the mass of people, it was the only\nface they could distinguish, and it affected them very much. The piano\nwas engagingly open and music littered about, but he apparently didn't\nsee it. He talked politics, and a good deal about pictures with some\nartists who were present.\n\n[Illustration: Franz Liszt.]\n\nI did hear him play many years later in London. We were again lunching\ntogether, at the house of a mutual friend, who was not at all musical.\nThere wasn't even a piano in the house, but she had one brought in for\nthe occasion. When I arrived rather early, the day of the party, I found\nthe mistress of the house, aided by Count Hatzfeldt, then German\nambassador to England, busily engaged in transforming her drawing-room.\nThe grand piano, which had been standing well out toward the middle of\nthe room, open, with music on it (I dare say some of Liszt's own--but I\ndidn't have time to examine), was being pushed back into a corner, all\nthe music hidden away, and the instrument covered with photographs,\nvases of flowers, statuettes, heavy books, all the things one doesn't\nhabitually put on pianos. I was quite puzzled, but Hatzfeldt, who was a\ngreat friend of Liszt's and knew all his peculiarities, when consulted\nby Madame A. as to what she could do to induce Liszt to play, had\nanswered: \"Begin by putting the piano in the furthest, darkest corner of\nthe room, and put all sorts of heavy things on it. Then he won't think\nyou have asked him in the hope of hearing him play, and perhaps we can\npersuade him.\" The arrangements were just finished as the rest of the\ncompany arrived. We were not a large party, and the talk was pleasant\nenough. Liszt looked much older, so colourless, his skin like ivory,\nbut he seemed just as animated and interested in everything. After\nluncheon, when they were smoking (all of us together, no one went into\nthe smoking-room), he and Hatzfeldt began talking about the Empire and\nthe beautiful fetes at Compiegne, where anybody of any distinction in\nany branch of art or literature was invited. Hatzfeldt led the\nconversation to some evenings when Strauss played his waltzes with an\nentrain, a sentiment that no one else has ever attained, and to\nOffenbach and his melodies--one evening particularly when he had\nimprovised a song for the Empress--he couldn't quite remember it. If\nthere were a piano--he looked about. There was none apparently. \"Oh,\nyes, in a corner, but so many things upon it, it was evidently never\nmeant to be opened.\" He moved toward it, Liszt following, asking\nComtesse A. if it could be opened. The things were quickly removed.\nHatzfeldt sat down and played a few bars in rather a halting fashion.\nAfter a moment Liszt said: \"No, no, it is not quite that.\" Hatzfeldt got\nup. Liszt seated himself at the piano, played two or three bits of\nsongs, or waltzes, then, always talking to Hatzfeldt, let his fingers\nwander over the keys and by degrees broke into a nocturne and a wild\nHungarian march. It was very curious; his fingers looked as if they\nwere made of yellow ivory, so thin and long, and of course there wasn't\nany strength or execution in his playing--it was the touch of an old\nman, but a master--quite unlike anything I have ever heard. When he got\nup, he said: \"Oh, well, I didn't think the old fingers had any music\nleft in them.\" We tried to thank him, but he wouldn't listen to us,\nimmediately talked about something else. When he had gone we\ncomplimented the ambassador on the way in which he had managed the\nthing. Hatzfeldt was a charming colleague, very clever, very musical, a\nthorough man of the world. I was always pleased when he was next to me\nat dinner--I was sure of a pleasant hour. He had been many years in\nParis during the brilliant days of the Empire, knew everybody there\nworth knowing. He had the reputation, notwithstanding his long stay in\nParis, of being very anti-French. I could hardly judge of that, as he\nnever talked politics to me. It may very likely have been true, but not\nmore marked with him than with the generality of Anglo-Saxons and\nNorthern races, who rather look down upon the Latins, hardly giving them\ncredit for their splendid dash and pluck--to say nothing of their\nbrains. I have lived in a great many countries, and always think that as\na people, I mean the uneducated mass, the French are the most\nintelligent nation in the world. I have never been thrown with the\nJapanese--am told they are extraordinarily intelligent.\n\nWe had a dinner one night for Mr. Gladstone, his wife, and a daughter.\nMr. Gladstone made himself quite charming, spoke French fairly well, and\nknew more about every subject discussed than any one else in the room.\nHe was certainly a wonderful man, such extraordinary versatility and\nsuch a memory. It was rather pretty to see Mrs. Gladstone when her\nhusband was talking. She was quite absorbed by him, couldn't talk to her\nneighbours. They wanted very much to go to the Conciergerie to see the\nprison where the unfortunate Marie Antoinette passed the last days of\nher unhappy life, and Mr. Gladstone, inspired by the subject, made us a\nsort of conference on the French Revolution and the causes which led up\nto it, culminating in the Terror and the execution of the King and\nQueen. He spoke in English (we were a little group standing at the\ndoor--they were just going), in beautiful academic language, and it was\nmost interesting, graphic, and exact. Even W., who knew him well and\nadmired him immensely, was struck by his brilliant improvisation.\n\n[Illustration: William E. Gladstone. From a photograph by Samuel A.\nWalker, London.]\n\nWe were often asked for permits by our English and American friends to\nsee all the places of historical interest in Paris, and the two places\nwhich all wanted to see were the Conciergerie and Napoleon's tomb at the\nInvalides. When we first came to Paris in 1866, just after the end of\nthe long struggle between the North and South in America, our first\nvisits too were for the Conciergerie, Invalides, and Notre Dame, where\nmy father had not been since he had gone as a very young man with all\nParis to see the flags that had been brought back from Austerlitz. They\nwere interesting days, those first ones in Paris, so full of memories\nfor father, who had been there a great deal in his young days, first as\nan eleve in the Ecole Polytechnique, later when the Allies were in\nParis. He took us one day to the Luxembourg Gardens, to see if he could\nfind any trace of the spot where in 1815 during the Restoration Marshal\nNey had been shot. He was in Paris at the time, and was in the garden a\nfew hours after the execution--remembered quite well the wall against\nwhich the marshal stood--and the comments of the crowd, not very\nflattering for the Government in executing one of France's bravest and\nmost brilliant soldiers.\n\nAll the Americans who came to see us at the Quai d'Orsay were much\ninterested in everything relating to General Marquis de Lafayette, who\nleft an undying memory in America, and many pilgrimages were made to the\nChateau de la Grange, where the Marquis de Lafayette spent the last\nyears of his life and extended a large and gracious hospitality to all\nhis friends. It is an interesting old place, with a moat all around it\nand high solid stone walls, where one still sees the hole that was made\nin the wall by a cannon-ball sent by Marechal de Turenne as he was\npassing with his troops, as a friendly souvenir to the owner, with whom\nhe was not on good terms. So many Americans and English too are imbued\nwith the idea that there are no chateaux, no country life in France,\nthat I am delighted when they can see that there are just as many as in\nany other country. A very clever American writer, whose books have been\nmuch read and admired, says that when travelling in France in the\ncountry, he never saw any signs of wealth or gentlemen's property. I\nthink he didn't want to admire anything French, but I wonder in what\npart of France he has travelled. Besides the well-known historic\nchateaux of Chaumont, Chenonceaux, Azay-le-Rideau, Maintenon, Dampierre,\nJosselin, Valencay, and scores of others, there are quantities of small\nLouis XV chateaux and manoirs, half hidden in a corner of a forest,\nwhich the stranger never sees. They are quite charming, built of red\nbrick with white copings, with stiff old-fashioned gardens, and trees\ncut into all sorts of fantastic shapes. Sometimes the parish church\ntouches the castle on one side, and there is a private entrance for the\nseigneurs. The interior arrangements in some of the old ones leave much\nto be desired in the way of comfort and modern improvements,--lighting\nvery bad, neither gas nor electricity, and I should think no baths\nanywhere, hardly a tub. On the banks of the Seine and the Loire, near\nthe great forests, in all the departments near Paris there are\nquantities of chateaux--some just on the border of the highroad,\nseparated from it by high iron gates, through which one sees long\nwinding alleys with stone benches and vases with red geraniums planted\nin them, a sun-dial and stiff formal rows of trees--some less\npretentious with merely an ordinary wooden gate, generally open, and\nalways flowers of the simplest kind, geraniums, sunflowers, pinks,\ndahlias, and chrysanthemums--what we call a jardin de cure, (curate's\ngarden)--but in great abundance. With very rare exceptions the lawns are\nnot well kept--one never sees in this country the smooth green turf that\none does in England.\n\nSome of the old chateaux are very stately--sometimes one enters by a\nlarge quadrangle, quite surrounded by low arcades covered with ivy, a\nfountain and good-sized basin in the middle of the courtyard, and a big\nclock over the door--sometimes they stand in a moat, one goes over a\ndrawbridge with massive doors, studded with iron nails and strong iron\nbolts and chains which defend the entrance, making one think of old\nfeudal days, when might was right, and if a man wanted his neighbours\nproperty, he simply took it. Even some of the smaller chateaux have\nmoats. I think they are more picturesque than comfortable--an\nivy-covered house with a moat around it is a nest for mosquitoes and\ninsects of all kinds, and I fancy the damp from the water must finish by\npervading the house. French people of all classes love the country and a\ngarden with bright flowers, and if the poorer ones can combine a rabbit\nhutch with the flowers they are quite happy.\n\nI have heard W. speak sometimes of a fine old chateau in our\ndepartment--(Aisne) belonging to a deputy, who invited his friends to\nshoot and breakfast. The cuisine and shooting were excellent, but the\naccommodations fantastic. The neighbours said nothing had been renewed\nor cleaned since the chateau was occupied by the Cossacks under the\nfirst Napoleon.\n\nWe got very little country life during those years at the Foreign\nOffice. Twice a year, in April and August, W. went to Laon for his\nConseil-General, over which he presided, but he was rarely able to stay\nall through the session. He was always present on the opening day, and\nat the prefet's dinner, and took that opportunity to make a short\nspeech, explaining the foreign policy of the Government. I don't think\nit interested his colleagues as much as all the local questions--roads,\nschools, etc. It is astonishing how much time is wasted and how much\nletter-writing is necessitated by the simplest change in a road or\nrailway crossing in France. We had rather a short narrow turning to get\ninto our gate at Bourneville, and W. wanted to have the road enlarged\njust a little, so as to avoid the sharp angle. It didn't interfere with\nany one, as we were several yards from the highroad, but it was months,\nmore than a year, before the thing was done. Any one of the workmen on\nthe farm would have finished it in a day's work.\n\nAt one of our small dinners I had such a characteristic answer from an\nEnglish diplomatist, who had been ambassador at St. Petersburg. He was\nreally a charming talker, but wouldn't speak French. That was of no\nconsequence as long as he only talked to me, but naturally all the\npeople at the table wanted to talk to him, and when the general\nconversation languished, at last, I said to him: \"I wish you would speak\nFrench; none of these gentlemen speak any other language.\" (It was quite\ntrue, the men of my husband's age spoke very rarely any other language\nbut their own; now almost all the younger generation speak German or\nEnglish or both. Almost all my son's friends speak English perfectly.)\n\"Oh no, I can't,\" he said; \"I haven't enough the habit of speaking\nFrench. I don't say the things I want to say, only the things I can say,\nwhich is very different.\" \"But what did you do in Russia?\" \"All the\nwomen speak English.\" \"But for affairs, diplomatic negotiations?\" \"All\nthe women speak English.\" I have often heard it said that the Russian\nwomen were much more clever than the men. He evidently had found\nit true.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nTHE EXPOSITION YEAR\n\nThe big political dinners were always interesting. On one occasion we\nhad a banquet on the 2d of December. My left-hand neighbour, a senator,\nsaid to me casually: \"This room looks very different from what it did\nthe last time I was in it.\" \"Does it? I should have thought a big\nofficial dinner at the Foreign Office would have been precisely the same\nunder any regime.\" \"A dinner perhaps, but on that occasion we were not\nprecisely dining. I and a number of my friends had just been arrested,\nand we were waiting here in this room strictly guarded, until it was\ndecided what should be done with us.\" Then I remembered that it was the\n2d of December, the anniversary of Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat. He said\nthey were quite unprepared for it, in spite of warnings. He was sent out\nof the country for a little while, but I don't think his exile was a\nvery terrible one.\n\nI got my first lesson in diplomatic politeness from Lord Lyons, then\nBritish ambassador in Paris. He was in Paris during the Franco-German\nWar, knew everybody, and had a great position. He gave very handsome\ndinners, liked his guests to be punctual, was very punctual himself,\nalways arrived on the stroke of eight when he dined with us. We had an\nAnnamite mission to dine one night and had invited almost all the\nambassadors and ministers to meet them. There had been a stormy sitting\nat the Chamber and W. was late. As soon as I was ready I went to his\nlibrary and waited for him; I couldn't go down and receive a foreign\nmission without him. We were quite seven or eight minutes late and found\nall the company assembled (except the Annamites, who were waiting with\ntheir interpreter in another room to make their entry in proper style).\nAs I shook hands with Lord Lyons (who was doyen of the diplomatic corps)\nhe said to me: \"Ah, Madame Waddington, I see the Republic is becoming\nvery royal; you don't receive your guests any more, merely come into the\nroom when all the company is assembled.\" He said it quite smilingly, but\nI understood very well, and of course we ought to have been there when\nthe first guests arrived. He was very amiable all the same and told me a\ngreat many useful things--for instance, that I must never invite a\ncardinal and an ambassador together, as neither of them would yield the\nprecedence and I would find myself in a very awkward position.\n\n[Illustration: Lord Lyons.]\n\nThe Annamites were something awful to see. In their country all the men\nof a certain standing blacken their teeth, and I suppose the dye makes\ntheir teeth fall out, as they hadn't any apparently, and when they\nopened their mouths the black caverns one saw were terrifying. I had\nbeen warned, but notwithstanding it made a most disagreeable impression\non me. They were very richly attired, particularly the first three, who\nwere tres grands seigneurs in Annam,--heavily embroidered silk robes,\nfeathers, and jewels, and when they didn't open their mouths they were\nrather a decorative group,--were tall, powerfully built men. They knew\nno French nor English--spoke through the interpreter. My intercourse\nwith them was very limited. They were not near me at dinner, but\nafterward I tried to talk to them a little. They all stood in a group at\none end of the room, flanked by an interpreter--the three principal\nchiefs well in front. I don't know what the interpreter said to them\nfrom me, probably embellished my very banal remarks with flowers of\nrhetoric, but they were very smiling, opening wide their black mouths\nand made me very low bows--evidently appreciated my intention and effort\nto be amiable.\n\nThey brought us presents, carpets, carved and inlaid mother-of-pearl\nboxes, cabinets, and some curious saddles, also gold-embroidered\ncushions and slippers. Some Arab horses were announced with great pomp\nfrom the Sultan's stables. I was rather interested in them, thought it\nwould be amusing to drive a long-tailed Arab pony in a little cart in\nthe morning. They were brought one morning to the Quai d'Orsay, and W.\ngave rendezvous to Comte de Pontecoulant and some of the sporting men of\nthe cabinet, in the courtyard. There were also several stablemen, all\nmuch interested in the idea of taming the fiery steeds of the desert.\nThe first look was disappointing. They were thin, scraggy animals,\napparently all legs and manes. Long tails they had, and small heads, but\nanything so tame and sluggish in their movements could hardly be\nimagined. One could scarcely get them to canter around the courtyard. We\nwere all rather disgusted, as sometimes one sees pretty little Arab\nhorses in Paris. I don't know what became of them; I fancy they were\nsent to the cavalry stables.\n\nOur first great function that winter was the service at the Madeleine\nfor the King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel, who died suddenly in the\nbeginning of January, 1878. France sent a special mission to the\nfuneral--the old Marshal Canrobert, who took with him the marshal's son,\nFabrice de MacMahon. The Church of the Madeleine was filled with people\nof all kinds--the diplomatic corps in uniform, a very large\nrepresentation of senators and deputies. There was a slight hesitation\namong some of the Left--who were ardent sympathisers with young\nItaly--but who didn't care to compromise themselves by taking part in a\nreligious ceremony. However, as a rule they went. Some of the ladies of\nthe Right were rather put out at having to go in deep mourning to the\nservice. I said to one of them: \"But you are not correct; you have a\nblack dress certainly, but I don't think pearl-grey gloves are proper\nfor such an occasion.\" \"Oh, they express quite sufficiently the grief I\nfeel on this occasion.\"\n\nIt was curious that the King should have gone before the old Pope, who\nhad been failing for some time. Every day we expected to hear of his\ndeath. There were many speculations over the new King of Italy, the\nPrince Humbert of our day. As we had lived so many years in Rome, I was\noften asked what he was like, but I really had no opinion. One saw him\nvery little. I remember one day in the hunting-field he got a nasty\nfall. His horse put his foot in a hole and fell with him. It looked a\nbad accident, as if the horse were going to roll over on him. I, with\none of my friends, was near, and seeing an accident (I didn't know who\nit was) naturally stopped to see if our groom could do anything, but an\nofficer rode hurriedly up and begged us to go on, that the Prince would\nbe very much annoyed if any one, particularly a woman, should notice his\nfall. I saw him later in the day, looking all right on another horse,\nand no one made any allusion to the accident.\n\nAbout a month after Victor Emmanuel's death the old Pope died, the 8th\nof February, 1878, quite suddenly at the end. He was buried of course in\nRome, and it was very difficult to arrange for his funeral in the Rome\nof the King of Italy. However, he did lie in state at St. Peter's, the\nnoble garde in their splendid uniforms standing close around the\ncatafalque--long lines of Italian soldiers, the bersaglieri with their\nwaving plumes, on each side of the great aisle. There was a magnificent\nservice for him at Notre Dame. The Chambers raised their sitting as a\nmark of respect to the head of the church, and again there was a great\nattendance at the cathedral. There were many discussions in the monde\n(society not official) \"as to whether one should wear mourning for the\nSaint Pere.\" I believe the correct thing is not to wear mourning, but\nalmost all the ladies of the Faubourg St. Germain went about in black\ngarments for some time. One of my friends put it rather graphically: \"Si\non a un ruban rose dans les cheveux on a tout de suite l'air d'etre la\nmaitresse de Rochefort.\"\n\nAll Europe was engrossed with the question of the Pope's successor.\nIntrigues and undercurrents were going on hard in Rome, and the issue of\nthe conclave was impatiently awaited. No one could predict any result.\nThe election of Cardinal Pecci, future Leo XIII, seemed satisfactory, at\nleast in the beginning.\n\nMy winter passed pleasantly enough; I began to feel more at home in my\nnew quarters, and saw many interesting people of all kinds. Every now\nand then there would be a very lively debate in the Parliament. W. would\ncome home very late, saying things couldn't go on like that, and we\nwould surely be out of office in a few weeks. We always kept our house\nin the rue Dumont d'Urville, and I went over every week, often thinking\nthat in a few days we should be back there again.\n\nOne of my great trials was a reception day. W. thought I ought to have\none, so every Friday I was at home from three until six, and very long\nafternoons they were. I insisted upon having a tea-table, which was a\nnovelty in those days, but it broke the stiff semicircle of red and gold\narmchairs carefully arranged at one end of the room. Very few men took\ntea. It was rather amusing to see some of the deputies who didn't\nexactly like to refuse a cup of tea offered to them by the minister's\nwife, holding the cup and saucer most carefully in their hands, making a\npretence of sipping the tea and replacing it hastily on the table as\nsoon as it was possible. I had of course a great many people of\ndifferent nationalities, who generally didn't know each other. The\nambassadresses and ministers' wives sat on each side of my sofa--the\nsmaller people lower down. They were all announced, my huissier, Gerard,\ndoing it very well, opening the big doors and roaring out the names.\nSometimes, at the end of the day, some of my own friends or some of the\nyoung men from the chancery would come in, and that would cheer me up a\nlittle. There was no conversation, merely an exchange of formal phrases,\nbut I had some funny experiences.\n\nOne day I had several ladies whom I didn't know at all, wives of\ndeputies, or small functionaries at some of the ministries. One of my\nfriends, Comtesse de B., was starting for Italy and Rome for the first\ntime. She had come to ask me all sorts of questions about clothes,\nhotels, people to see, etc. When she went away in a whirl of\npreparations and addresses, I turned to one of my neighbours, saying:\n\"Je crois qu'on est tres bien a l'Hotel de Londres a Rome,\" quite an\ninsignificant and inoffensive remark--merely to say something. She\nreplied haughtily: \"Je n'en sais rien, Madame; je n'ai jamais quitte\nParis et je m'en vante.\" I was so astonished that I had nothing to say,\nbut was afterward sorry that I had not continued the conversation and\nasked her why she was so especially proud of never having left Paris.\nTravelling is usually supposed to enlarge one's ideas. Her answer might\nhave been interesting. W. wouldn't believe it when I told him, but I\nsaid I couldn't really have invented it. I used to go into his cabinet\nat the end of the day always, when he was alone with Pontecoulant, and\ntell them all my experiences which W. forbid me to mention anywhere\nelse. I had a good many surprises, but soon learned never to be\nastonished and to take everything as a matter of course.\n\nThe great interest of the summer was the Exposition Universelle which\nwas to take place at the Trocadero, the new building which had been\nbuilt on the Champ de Mars. The opening was announced for the 1st of May\nand was to be performed with great pomp by the marshal. All Europe was\nrepresented except Germany, and almost all the great powers were sending\nprinces to represent their country. We went often to see how the works\nwere getting on, and I must say it didn't look as if it could possibly\nbe ready for the 1st of May. There were armies of workmen in every\ndirection and carts and camions loaded with cases making their way with\ndifficulty through the mud. Occasionally a light case or bale would fall\noff, and quantities of small boys who seemed always on the spot would\nprecipitate themselves, tumbling over each other to pick up what fell,\nand there would be protestations and explanations in every language\nunder the sun. It was a motley, picturesque crowd--the costumes and\nuniforms making so much colour in the midst of the very ordinary dark\nclothes the civilised Western world affects. I felt sorry for the\nOrientals and people from milder climes--they looked so miserably cold\nand wretched shivering under the very fresh April breezes that swept\nover the great plain of the Champ de Mars. The machines, particularly\nthe American ones, attracted great attention. There was always a crowd\nwaiting when some of the large pieces were swung down into their places\nby enormous pulleys.\n\nThe opening ceremony was very brilliant. Happily it was a beautiful warm\nday, as all the guests invited by the marshal and the Government were\nseated on a platform outside the Trocadero building. All the diplomatic\ncorps, foreign royalties, and commissioners of the different nations who\nwere taking part in the exposition were invited. The view was lovely as\nwe looked down from our seats. The great enclosure was packed with\npeople. All the pavilions looked very gay with bright- walls and\nturrets, and there were flags, palms, flowers, and fountains\neverywhere--the Seine running through the middle with fanciful bridges\nand boats. There was a curious collection of people in the tribunes. The\ninvitations had not been very easy to make. There were three Spanish\nsovereigns, Queen Isabella, her husband, Don Francois d'Assizes, and the\nDuc d'Aosta (King Amadee), who had reigned a few stormy months in Spain.\nHe had come to represent Italy at the exposition. The marshal was rather\npreoccupied with his Spanish royalties. He had a reception in the\nevening, to which all were invited, and thought it would be wise to take\ncertain precautions, so he sent one of his aides-de-camp to Queen\nIsabella to say that he hoped to have the honour of seeing her in the\nevening at the Elysee, but he thought it right to tell her that she\nmight perhaps have some disagreeable meetings. She replied: \"Si c'est\nmon mari de qui vous parlez, cela m'est tout a fait egal; si c'est le\nDuc d'Aosta, je serai ravie de le voir.\"\n\nShe came to the reception, but her husband was already gone. The Due\nd'Aosta was still there, and she walked straight up to him and kissed\nhim on both cheeks, not an easy thing to do, for the duke was not at all\nthe type of the gay lady's man--very much the reverse. He looked a\nsoldier (like all the princes of the house of Savoy) and at the same\ntime a monk. One could easily imagine him a crusader in plumed helmet\nand breastplate, supporting any privation or fatigue without a murmur.\nHe was very shy (one saw it was an effort for him every time that any\none was brought up to him and he had to make polite phrases), not in the\nleast mondain, but simple, charming when one talked to him.\n\nI saw him often afterward, as he represented his brother, King Humbert,\non various official occasions when I too was present--the coronation of\nthe Emperor Alexander of Russia, the Jubilee of Queen Victoria. He was\nalways a striking figure, didn't look as if he belonged to our modern\nworld at all. The marshal had a series of dinners and receptions which\nwere most brilliant. There was almost always music or theatricals, with\nthe best artists in Paris. The Comedie Francaise was much appreciated.\nTheir style is so finished and sure. They played just as well at one end\nof a drawing-room, with a rampe of flowers only separating them from the\npublic, as in their own theatre with all the help of scenery, acoustics,\nand distance. In a drawing-room naturally the audience is much nearer.\n\nI remember one charming party at the Elysee for the Austrian crown\nprince, the unfortunate Archduke Rudolph. All the stars of the Theatre\nFrancais were playing--Croizette, Reichemberg, Delaunay, Coquelin. The\nprince seemed to enjoy himself. He was very good-looking, with a slight,\nelegant figure and charming smile--didn't look like a man whose life\nwould end so tragically. When I saw him some years later in London, he\nwas changed, looked older, had lost his gaiety, was evidently bored with\nthe official entertaining, and used to escape from all the dinners and\nreceptions as soon as he could.\n\nThe late King Edward (then Prince of Wales) won golden opinions always.\nThere was certainly something in his personality which had an enormous\nattraction for Parisians. He always seemed to enjoy life, never looked\nbored, was unfailingly courteous and interested in the people he was\ntalking to. It was a joy to the French people to see him at some of the\nsmall theatres, amusing himself and understanding all the sous-entendus\nand argot quite as well as they did. It would almost seem as if what\nsome one said were true, that he reminded them of their beloved Henri\nIV, who still lives in the heart of the nation.\n\nHis brother-in-law, the Prince of Denmark, was also most amiable. We met\nhim often walking about the streets with one or two of his gentlemen,\nand looking in at the windows like an ordinary provincial. He was tall,\nwith a slight, youthful figure, and was always recognised. It was a\ngreat satisfaction and pride to Parisians to have so many royalties and\ndistinguished people among them again.\n\nThose two months of May and June gave back to Paris the animation and\ngaiety of the last days of the Empire. There were many handsome\ncarriages on the Champs-Elysees, filled with pretty, well-dressed women,\nand the opera and all the theatres were packed. Paris was illuminated\nthe night of the opening of the exposition, the whole city, not merely\nthe Champs-Elysees and boulevards. As we drove across the bridge on our\nway home from the reception at the Elysee, it was a beautiful sight--the\nstreets full of people waiting to see the foreign royalties pass, and\nthe view up and down the Seine, with the lights from the high buildings\nreflected in the water--like fairy-land.\n\n[Illustration: His Royal Highness, Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1876.\nFrom a photograph by Lock & Whitfield, London.]\n\nThe dinners and receptions at the Elysee and at all the ministries those\nfirst weeks of the exposition were interesting but so fatiguing. Happily\nthere were not many lunches nor day entertainments. I used to get a good\ndrive every afternoon in the open carriage with mother and baby, and\nthat kept me alive. Occasionally (not often) W. had a man's dinner, and\nthen I could go with some of my friends and dine at the exposition,\nwhich was very amusing--such a curious collection of people. The rue des\nNations was like a gigantic fair. We met all our friends, and heard\nevery language under the sun. Among other distinguished foreign guests\nthat year we had President and Mrs. Grant, who were received everywhere\nin Europe (England giving the example) like royalties. When they dined\nwith us at the Quai d'Orsay W. and I went to the top of the great\nstaircase to meet them, exactly as we did for the Prince and Princess\nof Wales.\n\nIt seems funny to me when I think of the very unceremonious manner in\nwhich not only ex-presidents but actual presidents were treated in\nAmerica when I was a child. I remember quite well seeing a president (I\nhave forgotten which one now) come into the big drawing-room at the old\nCozzen's Hotel at West Point, with two or three gentlemen with him.\nThere was a certain number of people in the room and nobody moved, or\ndreamt of getting up. However, the Grants were very simple--accepted all\nthe honours shown to them without a pose of any kind. The marshal gave\nthem a big dinner at the Elysee. We arrived a little late (we always\ndid) and found a large party assembled. The Grants came in just\nafter us.\n\nThe Marechale said to me: \"The Chinese ambassador will take you to\ndinner, Madame Waddington. He is an interesting, clever man, knows\nEngland and the English well--speaks English remarkably well.\" Just\nbefore dinner was announced the ambassador was brought up to me. He was\na striking-looking man, tall, broad-shouldered, dignified, very\ngorgeously attired in light-blue satin, embroidered in bright-\nflowers and gold and silver designs, and a splendid yellow bird of\nparadise in his cap. He didn't come quite up to me, made me a low bow\nfrom a certain distance, and then fell back into a group of smaller\nsatellites, all very splendidly dressed. When dinner was announced the\nfirst couples filed off--the marshal with Mrs. Grant and the Marechale\nwith President Grant and W. with his lady. There was a pause; I should\nhave gone next, but my ambassador wasn't forthcoming. I looked and\nwondered. All the aides-de-camp were making frantic signals to me to go\non, and the whole cortege was stopped. I really didn't know what to\ndo--I felt rather foolish. Presently the ambassador appeared--didn't\noffer me his arm, but again made me a low bow, which I returned and\nmoved a few steps forward. He advanced too and we made a stately\nprogress to the dining-room side by side. I heard afterward the\nexplanation. It seemed that in those days (things have changed _now_ I\nfancy) no Chinese of rank would touch any woman who didn't belong to\nhim, and the ambassador would have thought himself dishonoured (as well\nas me) if he had offered me his arm. The dinner was anything but banal.\n\nWhen we finally got to the table I found myself on the marshal's\nleft--Mrs. Grant was on his right. The marshal neither spoke nor\nunderstood English. Mrs. Grant spoke no French, so the conversation\ndidn't seem likely to be very animated. After a few moments Mrs. Grant\nnaturally wished to say something to her host and she addressed him in\nEnglish. \"Mr. President, I am so happy to be in your beautiful country,\"\nthen the marshal to me: \"Madame Waddington je vous en prie, dites a\nMadame Grant que je ne puis pas repondre; je ne comprends pas l'anglais;\nje ne puis pas parler avec elle.\" \"Mrs. Grant, the marshal begs me to\nsay to you that he regrets not being able to talk with you, but\nunfortunately he does not understand English.\" Then there was a pause\nand Mrs. Grant began again: \"What a beautiful palace, Mr. President. It\nmust be delightful with that charming garden.\" Again the marshal to me:\n\"Mais je vous en prie Madame, dites a Madame Grant que je ne puis pas\ncauser avec elle. Il ne faut pas qu'elle me parle, je ne comprends pas.\"\n\"Mrs. Grant, the marshal is distressed that he cannot talk to you, but\nhe _really_ does not understand any English.\" It was very trying for\nMrs. Grant. Happily her other neighbour knew a little English and she\ncould talk to him, but all through dinner, at intervals, she began again\nat the marshal.\n\nAfter a few moments I turned my attention to my ambassador. I had been\nlooking at him furtively while I was interpreting for the marshal and\nMrs. Grant. I saw that he _took_ everything that was offered to\nhim--dishes, wines, sauces--but he never attacked anything without\nwaiting to see what his neighbours did, when and how they used their\nknives and forks,--then did exactly as they did,--never made a mistake.\nI saw he was looking at the flowers on the table, which were very well\narranged, so I said to him, speaking very slowly and distinctly, as one\ndoes to a child or a deaf person: \"Have you pretty flowers in your\ncountry?\" He replied promptly: \"Yes, yes, very hot, very cold, very hot,\nvery cold.\" I was a little disconcerted, but thought I had perhaps\nspoken indistinctly, and after a little while I made another attempt:\n\"How much the uniforms add to the brilliancy of the fete, and the\nChinese dress is particularly striking and handsome,\" but to that he\nmade such a perfectly unintelligible answer that I refrained from any\nfurther conversation and merely smiled at him from time to time, which\nhe always acknowledged with a little bow.\n\nWe went back to the salons in the same way, side by side, and when the\nmen had gone into one of the other rooms to talk and smoke, I went to\nspeak to the Marechale, who said to me: \"I am sure you had a delightful\ndinner, Madame Waddington. The Chinese ambassador is such a clever man,\nhas travelled a great deal, and speaks such wonderful English.\"\n\"Wonderful indeed, Madame la Marechale,\" and then I repeated our\nconversation, which she could hardly believe, and which amused her very\nmuch. She spoke English as well as I did.\n\nThe Grants were very much entertained during their stay in Paris, and we\nmet them nearly every night. W. liked the general very much and found\nhim quite talkative when he was alone with him. At the big dinners he\nwas of course at a disadvantage, neither speaking nor understanding a\nword of French. W. acted as interpreter and found that very fatiguing.\nThere is so much repartee and sous-entendu in all French conversation\nthat even foreigners who know the language well find it sometimes\ndifficult to follow everything, and to translate quickly enough to keep\none au courant is almost impossible. When they could they drifted into\nEnglish, and W. said he was most interesting--speaking of the war and\nall the North had done, without ever putting himself forward.\n\nWe had both of us often to act as interpreters with French and\nAnglo-Saxons, neither understanding the other's language, and always\nfound it difficult. I remember a dinner at Sandringham some years ago\nwhen W. was at the embassy. The Prince of Wales (late King Edward) asked\nme to sit next to a foreign ambassador who understood not one word of\nEnglish. The dinner was exclusively English--a great many clever\nmen--the master of Trinity College, Cambridge (asked especially to meet\nmy husband, who graduated from Trinity College), Lord Goschen, James\nKnowles of the _Nineteenth Century_, Froude, the historian, Sir Henry\nJames, Lord Wolseley, etc. The talk was very animated, very witty. There\nwere peals of laughter all around the table. My ambassador was very\nfidgety and nervous, appealing to me all the time, but by the time I had\nlaboriously condensed and translated some of the remarks, they were\ntalking of something quite different, and I am afraid he had very hazy\nideas as to what they were all saying.\n\nWe saw, naturally, all the distinguished strangers who passed through\nParis that year of 1878. Many of our colleagues in the diplomatic corps\nhad played a great role in their own country. Prince Orloff, the Russian\nambassador, was one of our great friends. He gave us very good advice on\none or two occasions. He was a distinguished-looking man--always wore a\nblack patch over one eye--he had been wounded in the Crimea. He spoke\nEnglish as well as I did and was a charming talker. General Cialdini was\nat the Italian embassy. He was more of a soldier than a statesman--had\ncontributed very successfully to the formation of \"United Italy\" and the\nsuppression of the Pope's temporal power, and was naturally not exactly\npersona grata to the Catholics in France. Prince and Princess Hohenlohe\nhad succeeded Arnim at the German embassy. Their beginnings were\ndifficult, as their predecessor had done nothing to make the Germans\npopular in France, but their strong personality, tact, and understanding\nof the very delicate position helped them enormously. They were\nCatholics (the Princess born a Russian--her brother, Prince\nWittgenstein, military attache at the Russian embassy) and very big\npeople in their own country, so absolutely sure of themselves and their\nposition that it was very difficult to slight them in any way. They\nwould never have perceived it unless some extraordinary rudeness were\nshown. The Princess was very striking-looking, tall, with a good figure,\nand splendid jewels. When she was in full dress for a ball, or official\nreception, she wore three necklaces, one on top of the other, and a big\nhandsome, high tiara, which added to her height. She was the only lady\nof the diplomatic corps whom Madame Grevy ever recognised in the first\nweeks of her husband's presidency. Madame Grevy was thrown suddenly not\nvery young into such an absolutely new milieu, that she was quite\nbewildered and couldn't be expected to recognise half the women of the\ndiplomatic corps, but the German ambassadress impressed her and she knew\nher always. The princess was not very mondaine, didn't care about\nsociety and life in a city--preferred the country, with riding and\nshooting and any sort of sport.\n\nWe had a very handsome dinner at the German embassy the winter of\n1878--given to the Marshal and Madame de MacMahon. After dinner, with\ncoffee, a bear made its appearance in the drawing-room, a \"baby bear\"\nthey said, but I didn't think it looked very small. The princess patted\nit, and talked to it just as if it were a dog, and I must say the little\nanimal was perfectly quiet, and kept close to her. I think the lights\nand the quantity of people frightened it. It growled once or twice, and\nwe all had a feeling of relief when it was taken away. I asked the\nMarechale afterward if she were afraid. \"Oui, j'avais tres peur, mais je\nne voulais pas le montrer devant ces allemands.\" (Yes, I was very\nfrightened, but I would not show it before those Germans.) They had\neventually to send the bear away, back to Germany. It grew wilder as it\ngrew older, and became quite unmanageable--they couldn't keep it in\nthe embassy.\n\nHohenlohe was always pleasant and easy. I think he had a real sympathy\nfor France and did his best on various delicate occasions. The year of\nthe exposition (1878) we dined out every night and almost always with\nthe same people. Hohenlohe often fell to me. He took me in to dinner ten\ntimes in succession. The eleventh time we were each of us in despair as\nwe filed out together, so I said to him: \"Don't let us even pretend to\ntalk; you can talk to your other neighbour and I will to mine.\" However,\nwe _did_ talk chiffons, curiously enough. I had waited for a dress,\nwhich only came home at the last moment, and when I put it on the\ncorsage was so tight I could hardly bear it. It was too late to change,\nand I had nothing else ready, so most uncomfortable I started for my\ndinner. I didn't dare to eat anything, hardly dared move, which\nHohenlohe remarked, after seeing three or four dishes pass me untouched,\nand said to me: \"I am afraid you are ill; you are eating nothing.\" \"No,\nnot at all, only very uncomfortable\"--and then I explained the situation\nto him--that my dress was so tight I could neither move nor eat. He was\nmost indignant--\"How could women be so foolish--why did we want to\nhave abnormally small waists and be slaves to our dressmakers?--men\ndidn't like made-up figures.\" \"Oh, yes, they do; all men admire a\nslight, graceful figure.\" \"Yes, when it is natural, but no man\nunderstands nor cares about a fashionably dressed woman--women dress for\neach other\" (which is perfectly true).\n\n[Illustration: Prince Hohenlohe. After the painting by F.E. Laszlo.]\n\nHowever, he was destined to see other ladies very careful about their\nfigures. The late Empress of Austria, who was a fine rider, spent some\ntime one spring in Paris, and rode every morning in the Bois. She was\nvery handsome, with a beautiful figure, had handsome horses and\nattracted great attention. Prince Hohenlohe often rode with her. I was\nriding with a friend one morning when we saw handsome horses waiting at\nthe mounting-block, just inside the gates. We divined they were the\nEmpress's horses and waited to see her mount. She arrived in a coupe,\nher maid with her, and mounted her horse from the block. The body of her\nhabit was open. When she was settled in her saddle, the maid stepped up\non the block and buttoned her habit, which I must say fitted\nbeautifully--as if she were melted into it.\n\nThe official receptions were interesting that year, as one still saw a\nfew costumes. The Chinese, Japanese, Persians, Greeks, and Roumanians\nwore their national dress--and much better they look in them than in\nthe ordinary dress coat and white tie of our men. The Greek dress was\nvery striking, a full white skirt with high embroidered belt, but it was\nonly becoming when the wearer was young, with a good figure. I remember\na pretty Roumanian woman with a white veil spangled with gold, most\neffective. Now every one wears the ordinary European dress except the\nChinese, who still keep their costume. One could hardly imagine a\nChinese in a frock coat and tall hat. What would he do with his pigtail?\n\nThe entertainments went on pretty well that year until August, almost\nall the embassies and ministries receiving. Queen Isabella of Spain was\nthen living in the big house in the Avenue Kleber, called the \"Palais\nd'Espagne\" (now the Hotel Majestic). We used to meet her often driving\nin the Bois. She was a big, stout, rather red-faced woman, didn't make\nmuch effect in a carriage in ordinary street dress, but in her palace,\nwhen she received or gave an audience, she was a very royal lady. I\nasked for an audience soon after W. was named to the Foreign Office. We\nknew one of her chamberlains very well, Duc de M., and he arranged it\nfor me. I arrived at the palace on the appointed day a little before\nfour (the audience was for four). The big gates were open, a tall porter\ndressed in red and gold lace and buttons, and a staff in his hand, was\nwaiting--two or three men in black, and four or five footmen in red\nliveries and powder, at the door and in the hall. I was shown at once to\na small room on the ground floor, where four or five ladies, all Spanish\nand all fat, were waiting. In a few minutes the duke appeared. We talked\na little (he looking at me to see if I had taken off my veil and my\nright-hand glove) and then a man in black appeared at the door, making a\nlow bow and saying something in Spanish. The duke said would I come, Her\nMajesty was ready to receive me. We passed through several salons where\nthere were footmen and pages (no ladies) until we came to a very large\none quite at the other end of the palace. The big doors were open, and\nat the far end I saw the Queen standing, a stately figure (enormous),\ndressed in a long black velvet dress, a high diamond tiara on her head,\nfrom which hung a black lace veil, a fan in her hand (I suppose no\nSpanish woman of any station ever parts with her fan) and a splendid\nstring of pearls. I made my curtsey on the threshold, the chamberlain\nnamed me with the usual formula: \"I have the honour to present to Your\nMajesty, Madame Waddington, the wife of the Minister of Foreign\nAffairs,\" then backed himself out of the room, and I proceeded down the\nlong room to the Queen. She didn't move, let me make my two curtseys,\none in the middle of the room, one when I came close up to her--and then\nshook hands. We remained standing a few minutes and then she sat down on\na sofa (not a very small one) which she quite filled, and motioned me to\ntake an armchair on one side. She was very amiable, had a charming\nsmile, spoke French very well but with a strong Spanish accent. She said\nshe was very glad to see my husband at the Foreign Office, and hoped he\nwould stay long enough to do some real work--said she was very fond of\nFrance, loved driving in the streets of Paris, there was always so much\nto see and the people looked gay. She was very fond of the theatres,\nparticularly the smaller ones, liked the real Parisian wit and gaiety\nbetter than the measured phrase and trained diction of the Francais and\nthe Odeon. She spoke most warmly of Marshal MacMahon, hoped that he\nwould remain President of the Republic as long as the Republicans would\nlet him, was afraid they would make his position impossible--but that\nthe younger generation always wanted reforms and changes. I said I\nthought that was the way of the world everywhere, in families as well\nas nations--children could not be expected to see with the eyes of their\nparents. Then we talked about the exposition--she said the Spanish show\nwas very good--told me to look at the tapestries and embroideries, which\nwere quite wonderful--gold and silver threads worked in with the\ntapestries. The interview was pleasant and easy. When I took leave, she\nlet me back down the whole length of the room, not half turning away as\nso many princesses do after the first few steps, so as to curtail that\nvery inconvenient exit. However, a day dress is never so long and\ncumbersome as an evening dress with a train.\n\nThe chamberlain was waiting just outside the door, also two ladies in\nwaiting, just as fat as the Queen. Certainly the mise en scene was very\neffective. The number of servants in red liveries, the solitary standing\nfigure at the end of the long enfilade of rooms, the high diamond comb\nand long veil, quite transformed the very stout, red-faced lady whom I\nused to meet often walking in the Bois.\n\nWe dined once or twice at the palace, always a very handsome dinner. One\nfor the Marshal and Madame de MacMahon was beautifully done--all the\nfootmen, dozens, in gala liveries, red and yellow, the maitre d'hotel in\nvery dark blue with gold epaulettes and aiguillettes. The table was\ncovered with red and yellow flowers and splendid gold plate, and a very\ngood orchestra of guitars and mandolins played all through dinner, the\nmusicians singing sometimes when they played a popular song. We were all\nassembled in one of the large rooms waiting for the Queen to appear. As\nsoon as the Marshal and Madame de MacMahon were announced, she came in,\nmeeting them at the door, making a circle afterward, and shaking hands\nwith all the ladies.\n\nLord Lyons gave a beautiful ball at the embassy that season. The hotel\nof the British embassy is one of the best in Paris--fine reception-rooms\nopening on a very large garden, and a large courtyard and side exit--so\nthere was no confusion of carriages. He had need of all his room--Paris\nwas crowded with English. Besides all the exposition people, there were\nmany tourists and well-known English people, all expecting to be\nentertained at the embassy. All the world was there. The Prince and\nPrincess of Wales, the Marshal and Madame de MacMahon, the Orleans\nprinces, Princesse Mathilde, the Faubourg St. Germain, the Government,\nand as many foreigners as the house could hold, as he invited a great\nmany people, once his obligations, English and official, were\nsatisfied. It was only at an embassy that such a gathering could take\nplace, and it was amusing to see the people of all the different camps\nlooking at each other.\n\nThere was a supper up-stairs for all the royalties before the cotillion.\nI was told that the Duc d'Aumale would take me to supper. I was very\npleased (as we knew him very well and he was always charming to us) but\nmuch surprised, as the Orleans princes never remained for supper at any\nbig official function. There would have been questions of place and\nprecedence which would have been very difficult to settle. When the move\nwas made for supper, things had to be changed, as the Orleans princes\nhad gone home. The Crown Prince of Denmark took me. The supper-room was\nprettily arranged, two round tables--Lord Lyons with the Princesses of\nWales and Denmark presiding at one--his niece, the Duchesse of Norfolk,\nat the other, with the Princes of Wales and Denmark. I sat between the\nPrinces of Denmark and Sweden. Opposite me, next the Prince of Wales,\nsat a lady I didn't know. Every one else at the table did. She was very\nattractive-looking, with a charming smile and most animated manner. I\nasked the Prince of Denmark in a low voice, who she was--thought it must\nbe one of the foreign princesses I hadn't yet met. The Prince of Wales\nheard my question, and immediately, with his charming tact and ease of\nmanner, said to me: \"You don't know the Princesse Mathilde; do let me\nhave the pleasure of presenting you to her,\" naming me at once--in my\nofficial capacity, \"wife of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\" The\nprincess was very gracious and smiling, and we talked about all sorts of\nthings--some of her musical protegees, who were also mine. She asked me\nif I liked living at the ministry, Quai d'Orsay; she remembered it as\nsuch a beautiful house. When the party broke up, she shook hands, said\nshe had not the pleasure of knowing M. Waddington, but would I thank him\nfrom her for what he had done for one of her friends. I tried to find W.\nafter supper to present him to the princess, but he had already gone,\ndidn't stay for the cotillion--the princess, too, went away immediately\nafter supper. I met her once or twice afterward. She was always\nfriendly, and we had little talks together. Her salon--she received once\na week--was quite a centre--all the Bonapartists of course, the\ndiplomatic corps, many strangers, and all the celebrities in\nliterature and art.\n\nWith that exception I never saw nor talked with any member of that\nfamily until I had been some years a widow, when the Empress Eugenie\nreceived me on her yacht at Cowes. When the news came of the awful\ntragedy of the Prince Imperial's death in Zululand, W. was Foreign\nMinister, and he had invited a large party, with music. W. instantly put\noff the party, said there was no question of politics or a Bonapartist\nprince--it was a Frenchman killed, fighting bravely in a foreign\ncountry. I always thought the Empress knew about it and appreciated his\nact, for during his embassy in London, though we never saw her, she\nconstantly sent him word through mutual friends of little negotiations\nshe knew about and thought might interest him, and always spoke very\nwell of him as a \"clear-headed, patriotic statesman.\" I should have\nliked to have seen her in her prime, when she must have been\nextraordinarily beautiful and graceful. When I did see her she was no\nlonger young, but a stately, impressive figure, and had still the\nbeautiful brow one sees in all her pictures. One of our friends, a very\nclever woman and great anti-Bonapartist, told us an amusing story of her\nlittle son. The child was sometimes in the drawing-room when his mother\nwas receiving, and heard her and all her friends inveighing against the\niniquities of the Imperial Court and the frivolity of the Empress. He\nsaw the Empress walking one day in the Bois de Boulogne. She was\nattracted by the group of children, stopped and talked to them. The boy\nwas delighted and said to his governess: \"Elle est bien jolie,\nl'Imperatrice, mais il ne faut pas le dire a Maman.\" (The Empress is\nvery pretty, but one must not say it to mother.)\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nTHE BERLIN CONGRESS\n\nSeventy-eight was a most important year for us in many ways. Besides the\ninterest and fatigues of the exposition and the constant receiving and\nofficial festivities of all kinds, a great event was looming before\nus--the Berlin Congress. One had felt it coming for some time. There\nwere all sorts of new delimitations and questions to be settled since\nthe war in the Balkans, and Europe was getting visibly nervous. Almost\nimmediately after the opening of the exposition, the project took shape,\nand it was decided that France should participate in the Congress and\nsend three representatives. It was the first time that France had\nasserted herself since the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, but it was time\nfor her now to emerge from her self-imposed effacement, and take her\nplace in the Congress of nations. There were many discussions, both\npublic and private, before the plenipotentiaires were named, and a great\nunwillingness on the part of many very intelligent and patriotic\nFrenchmen to see the country launching itself upon dangerous ground and\na possible conflict with Bismarck. However, the thing was decided, and\nthe three plenipotentiaries named--Mr. Waddington, Foreign Minister,\nfirst; Comte de St. Vallier, a very clever and distinguished\ndiplomatist, actual ambassador at Berlin, second; and Monsieur Desprey,\nDirecteur de la Politique au Ministere des Affaires Etrangeres, third.\nHe was also a very able man, one of the pillars of the ministry, au\ncourant of every treaty and negotiation for the last twenty years, very\nprudent and clear-headed. All W.'s colleagues were most cordial and\ncharming on his appointment. He made a statement in the House of the\nline of policy he intended to adopt--and was absolutely approved and\nencouraged. Not a disparaging word of any kind was said, not even the\nusual remark of \"cet anglais qui nous represente.\" He started the 10th\nof June in the best conditions possible--not an instruction of any kind\nfrom his chief, M. Dufaure, President du Conseil--very complimentary to\nhim certainly, but the ministers taking no responsibility\nthemselves--leaving the door open in case he made any mistakes. It was\nevident that the Parliament and Government were nervous. It was rather\namusing, when all the preparations for the departure were going on. W.\ntook a large suite with him, secretaries, huissiers, etc., and I told\nthem they were as much taken up with their coats and embroideries and\ncocked hats as any pretty woman with her dresses. I wanted very much to\ngo, but W. thought he would be freer and have more time to think things\nover if I were not there. He didn't know Berlin at all, had never seen\nBismarck nor any of the leading German statesmen, and was fully\nconscious how his every word and act would be criticised. However, if a\npublic man is not criticised, it usually means that he is of no\nconsequence--so attacks and criticisms are rather welcome--act as a\nstimulant. I could have gone and stayed unofficially with a cousin, but\nhe thought that wouldn't do. St. Vallier was a bachelor; it would have\nbeen rather an affair for him to organise at the embassy an apartment\nfor a lady and her maids, though he was most civil and asked me to come.\n\n[Illustration: M. William Waddington. In the uniform he wore as Minister\nof Foreign Affairs and at the Berlin Congress, 1878]\n\nI felt rather lonely in the big ministry when they had all gone, and I\nwas left with baby. W. stayed away just five weeks, and I performed\nvarious official things in his absence--among others the Review of the\n14th of July. The distinguished guest on that occasion was the Shah of\nPersia, who arrived with the Marechale in a handsome open carriage,\nwith outriders and postilions. The marshal of course was riding. The\nShah was not at all a striking figure, short, stout, with a dark skin,\nand hard black eyes. He had handsome jewels, a large diamond fastening\nthe white aigrette of his high black cap, and his sword-hilt incrusted\nwith diamonds. He gave a stiff little nod in acknowledgment of the bows\nand curtseys every one made when he appeared in the marshal's box. He\nimmediately took his seat on one side of the Marechale in front of the\nbox, one of the ambassadresses, Princess Hohenlohe I think, next to him.\nThe military display seemed to interest him. Every now and then he made\nsome remark to the Marechale, but he was certainly not talkative. While\nthe interminable line of the infantry regiments was passing, there was a\nmove to the back of the box, where there was a table with ices,\nchampagne, etc. Madame de MacMahon came up to me, saying: \"Madame\nWaddington, Sa Majeste demande les nouvelles de M. Waddington,\" upon\nwhich His Majesty planted himself directly in front of me, so close that\nhe almost touched me, and asked in a quick, abrupt manner, as if he were\nfiring off a shot: \"Ou est votre mari?\" (neither Madame, nor M.\nWaddington, nor any of the terms that are usually adopted in polite\nsociety). \"A Berlin, Sire.\" \"Pourquoi a Berlin?\" \"Comme\nplenipotentiaire Francais au Congres de Berlin.\" \"Oui, oui, je sais, je\nsais. Cela l'interesse?\" \"Beaucoup; il voit tant de personnes\ninteressantes.\" \"Oui, je sais. Il va bien?\" always coming closer to me,\nso that I was edging back against the wall, with his hard, bright little\neyes fixed on mine, and always the same sharp, jerky tone. \"Il va\nparfaitement bien, je vous remercie.\" Then there was a pause and he made\none or two other remarks which I didn't quite understand--I don't think\nhis French went very far--but I made out something about \"jolies femmes\"\nand pointed out one or two to him, but he still remained staring into my\nface and I was delighted when his minister came up to him (timidly--all\nhis people were afraid of him) and said some personage wanted to be\npresented to him. He shook hands with me, said something about \"votre\nmari revient bientot,\" and moved off. The Marechale asked me if I were\nnot touched by His Majesty's solicitude for my husband's health, and\nwouldn't I like to come to the front of the box and sit next to him, but\nI told her I couldn't think of engrossing His Majesty's attention, as\nthere were various important people who wished to be presented to him. I\nwatched him a little (from a distance), trying to see if anything made\nany impression on him (the crowd, the pretty, well-dressed women, the\nmarch past, the long lines of infantry,--rather fatiguing to see, as one\nline regiment looks very like another,--the chasseurs with their small\nchestnut horses, the dragoons more heavily mounted, and the guns), but\nhis face remained absolutely impassive, though I think he saw\neverything. They told a funny story of him in London at one of the court\nballs. When he had looked on at the dancing for some time, he said to\nthe Prince of Wales: \"Tell those people to stop now, I have seen\nenough\"--evidently thought it was a ballet performing for his amusement.\nAnother one, at one of the European courts was funny. The monarch was\nvery old, his consort also. When the Shah was presented to the royal\nlady, he looked hard at her without saying a word, then remarked to her\nhusband: \"Laide, vieille, pourquoi garder?\" (Ugly, old; why keep her?)\n\n[Illustration: Nasr-ed-Din, Shah of Persia.]\n\nI went to a big dinner and reception at the British Embassy, given for\nall the directors and commissioners of the exposition. It was a lovely\nwarm night, the garden was lighted, everybody walking about, and an\norchestra playing. Many of the officials had their wives and daughters\nwith them, and some of the toilettes were wonderful. There were a good\nmany pretty women, Swedes and Danes, the Northern type, very fair hair\nand blue eyes, attracting much attention, and a group of Chinese (all in\ncostume) standing proudly aloof--not the least interested apparently in\nthe gay scene before them. I wonder what they thought of European\nmanners and customs! There was no dancing, which I suppose would have\nshocked their Eastern morals. Lord Lyons asked me why I wasn't in\nBerlin. I said, \"For the best of reasons, my husband preferred going\nwithout me--but I hoped he would send for me perhaps at the end of the\nCongress.\" He told me Lady Salisbury was there with her husband. He\nseemed rather sceptical as to the peaceful issue of the\nnegotiations--thought so many unforeseen questions would come up and\ncomplicate matters.\n\nI went to a ball at the Hotel de Ville, also given for all the\nforeigners and French people connected with the exposition. The getting\nthere was very long and tiring. The coupe-file did no good, as every one\nhad one. Comte de Pontecoulant went with me and he protested vigorously,\nbut one of the head men of the police, whom he knew well, came up to the\ncarriage to explain that nothing could be done. There was a long line of\ndiplomatic and official carriages, and we must take our chance with the\nrest. Some of our cousins (Americans) never got there at all--sat for\nhours in their carriage in the rue du Rivoli, moving an inch at a time.\nHappily it was a lovely warm night; and as we got near we saw lots of\npeople walking who had left their carriages some little distance off,\nhopelessly wedged in a crowd of vehicles--the women in light dresses,\nwith flowers and jewels in their hair. The rooms looked very handsome\nwhen at last we did get in, particularly the staircase, with a Garde\nMunicipal on every step, and banks of palms and flowers on the landing\nin the hall, wherever flowers could be put. The Ville de Paris furnishes\nall the flowers and plants for the official receptions, and they always\nare very well arranged. Some trophies of flags too of all nations made a\ngreat effect. I didn't see many people I knew--it was impossible to get\nthrough the crowd, but some one got me a chair at the open window giving\non the balcony, and I was quite happy sitting there looking at the\npeople pass. The whole world was represented, and it was interesting to\nsee the different types--Southerners, small, slight, dark, impatient,\nwriggling through the crowd--the Anglo-Saxons, big, broad, calm,\nsquaring their shoulders when there came a sudden rush, and waiting\nquite patiently a chance to get a little ahead. Some of the women too\npushed well--evidently determined to see all they could. I don't think\nany royalties, even minor ones, were there.\n\nW. wrote pretty regularly from Berlin, particularly the first days,\nbefore the real work of the Congress began. He started rather sooner\nthan he had at first intended, so as to have a little time to talk\nmatters over with St. Vallier and make acquaintance with some of his\ncolleagues. St. Vallier, with all the staff of the embassy, met him at\nthe station when he arrived in Berlin, also Holstein (our old friend who\nwas at the German Embassy in Paris with Arnim) to compliment him from\nPrince Bismarck, and he had hardly been fifteen minutes at the embassy\nwhen Count Herbert von Bismarck arrived with greetings and compliments\nfrom his father. He went to see Bismarck the next day, found him at\nhome, and very civil; he was quite friendly, very courteous and\n\"bonhomme, original, and even amusing in his conversation, but with a\nhard look about the eyes which bodes no good to those who cross his\npath.\" He had just time to get back to the embassy and get into his\nuniform for his audience with the Crown Prince (late Emperor\nFrederick).[1] The Vice Grand-Maitre des Ceremonies came for him in a\ncourt carriage and they drove off to the palace--W. sitting alone on the\nback seat, the grand-maitre facing him on the front. \"I was ushered into\na room where the Prince was standing. He was very friendly and talked\nfor twenty minutes about all sorts of things, in excellent French, with\na few words of English now and then to show he knew of my English\nconnection. He spoke of my travels in the East, of the de Bunsens, of\nthe Emperor's health (the old man is much better and decidedly\nrecovering)--and of his great wish for peace.\" All the plenipotentiaries\nhad not yet arrived. They appeared only on the afternoon of the 12th,\nthe day before the Congress opened. Prince Bismarck sent out the\ninvitation for the first sitting:\n\n[Footnote 1: The Crown Prince represented his father at all the\nfunctions. Some days before the meeting of the Congress the old Emperor\nhad been wounded in the arm by a nihilist, Nobiling, who Fired from a\nwindow when the Emperor was passing in an open carriage. The wound was\nslight, but the old man was much shaken and unable to take any part in\nthe ceremonies or receive any of the plenipotentiaries.]\n\n                Le Prince de Bismarck\n     a l'honneur de prevenir Son Excellence, Monsieur Waddington,\n     que la premiere reunion du Congres aura lieu le\n     13 juin a deux heures, au Palais du Chancelier de l'Empire,\n     77, Wilhelmstrasse.\n                      \"Berlin, le 12 juin 1878.\"\n\nIt was a brilliant assemblage of great names and intelligences that\nresponded to his invitation--Gortschakoff, Schouvaloff, Andrassy,\nBeaconsfield, Salisbury, Karolyi, Hohenlohe, Corti, and many others,\nyounger men, who acted as secretaries. French was the language spoken,\nthe only exception being made by Lord Beaconsfield, who always spoke in\nEnglish, although it was most evident, W. said, that he understood\nFrench perfectly well. The first day was merely an official opening of\nthe Congress--every one in uniform--but only for that occasion. After\nthat they all went in ordinary morning dress, putting on their uniforms\nagain on the last day only, when they signed the treaty. W. writes:\n\"Bismarck presides and did his part well to-day; he speaks French fairly\nbut very slowly, finding his words with difficulty, but he knows what he\nmeans to say and lets every one see that he does.\" No one else said much\nthat first day; each man was rather reserved, waiting for his neighbour\nto begin. Beaconsfield made a short speech, which was trying for some of\nhis colleagues, particularly the Turks, who had evidently much\ndifficulty in understanding English. They were counting upon England's\nsympathy, but a little nervous as to a supposed agreement between\nEngland and Russia. The Russians listened most attentively. There seemed\nto be a distrust of England on their part and a decided rivalry between\nGortschakoff and Beaconsfield. The Congress dined that first night with\nthe Crown Prince at the Schloss in the famous white hall--all in uniform\nand orders. W. said the heat was awful, but the evening interesting.\nThere were one hundred and forty guests, no ladies except the royal\nprincesses, not even the ambassadresses. W. sat on Bismarck's left, who\ntalked a great deal, intending to make himself agreeable. He had a long\ntalk after dinner with the Crown Princess (Princess Royal of England)\nwho spoke English with him. He found her charming--intelligent and\ncultivated and so easy--not at all stiff and shy like so many royalties.\nHe saw her very often during his stay in Berlin, and she was unfailingly\nkind to him--and to me also when I knew her later in Rome and London.\nShe always lives in my memory as one of the most charming women I have\never met. Her face often comes back to me with her beautiful bright\nsmile and the saddest eyes I have ever seen. I have known very few like\nher. W. also had a talk with Prince Frederick-Charles, father of the\nDuchess of Connaught, whom he found rather a rough-looking soldier with\na short, abrupt manner. He left bitter memories in France during the\nFranco-German War, was called the \"Red Prince,\" he was so hard and\ncruel, always ready to shoot somebody and burn down villages on the\nslightest provocation--so different from the Prince Imperial, the \"unser\nFritz\" of the Germans, who always had a kind word for the fallen foe.\n\n[Illustration: Prince Bismarck. From a sketch by Anton von Werner,\n1880.]\n\nW.'s days were very full, and when the important sittings began it was\nsometimes hard work. The Congress room was very hot (all the colleagues\nseemed to have a holy horror of open windows)--and some of the men very\nlong and tedious in stating their cases. Of course they were at a\ndisadvantage not speaking their own language (very few of them knew\nFrench well, except the Russians), and they had to go very carefully,\nand be quite sure of the exact significance of the words they used. W.\ngot a ride every morning, as the Congress only met in the afternoon.\nThey rode usually in the Thiergarten, which is not very large, but the\nbridle-paths were good. It was very difficult to get out of Berlin into\nthe open country without going through a long stretch of suburbs and\nsandy roads which were not very tempting. A great many officers rode in\nthe park, and one morning when he was riding with the military attache\nof the embassy, two officers rode up and claimed acquaintance, having\nknown him in France in '70, the year of the war. They rode a short time\ntogether, and the next day he received an invitation from the officers\nof a smart Uhlan regiment to dine at their mess \"in remembrance of the\nkind hospitality shown to some of their officers who had been quartered\nat his place in France during the war.\" As the hospitality was decidedly\nforced, and the presence of the German officers not very agreeable to\nthe family, the invitation was not very happy. It was well meant, but\nwas one of those curious instances of German want of tact which one\nnotices so much if one lives much with Germans. The hours of the various\nentertainments were funny. At a big dinner at Prince Bismarck's the\nguests were invited at six, and at eight-thirty every one had gone. W.\nsat next to Countess Marie, the daughter of the house, found her simple\nand inclined to talk, speaking both French and English well. Immediately\nafter dinner the men all smoked everywhere, in the drawing-room, on the\nterrace, some taking a turn in the park with Bismarck. W. found Princess\nBismarck not very femme du monde; she was preoccupied first with her\ndinner, then with her husband, for fear he should eat too much, or take\ncold going out of the warm dining-room into the evening air. There were\nno ladies at the dinner except the family. (The German lady doesn't seem\nto occupy the same place in society as the French and English woman\ndoes. In Paris the wives of ambassadors and ministers are always invited\nto all official banquets.)\n\nAmusements of all kinds were provided for the plenipotentiaries. Early\nin July W. writes of a \"Land-parthie\"--the whole Congress (wives too\nthis time) invited to Potsdam for the day. He was rather dreading a long\nday--excursions were not much in his line. However, this one seems to\nhave been successful. He writes: \"Our excursion went off better than\ncould be expected. The party consisted of the plenipotentiaries and a\ncertain number of court officers and generals. We started by rail,\nstopped at a station called Wannsee, and embarked on board a small\nsteamer, the Princess Royal receiving the guests as they arrived on\nboard. We then started for a trip on the lakes, but before long there\ncame a violent squall which obliged the sailors to take down the awnings\nin double-quick time, and drove every one down into the cabins. It\nlasted about half an hour, after which it cleared up and every one\nreappeared on deck. In course of time we landed near Babelsberg, where\ncarriages were waiting. I was told off to go in the first with the\nPrincess Royal, Countess Karolyi (wife of the Austrian ambassador, a\nbeautiful young woman), and Andrassy. We went over the Chateau of\nBabelsberg, which is a pretty Gothic country-seat, not a palace, and\nbelongs to the present Emperor. After that we had a longish drive,\nthrough different parks and villages, and finally arrived at Sans Souci,\nwhere we dined. After dinner we strolled through the rooms and were\nshown the different souvenirs of Frederick the Great, and got home at\nten-thirty.\" W. saw a good deal of his cousin, George de Bunsen, a\ncharming man, very cultivated and cosmopolitan. He had a pretty house in\nthe new quarter of Berlin, and was most hospitable. He had an\ninteresting dinner there with some of the literary men and\nsavants--Mommsen, Leppius, Helmholtz, Curtius, etc., most of them his\ncolleagues, as he was a member of the Berlin Academy. He found those\nevenings a delightful change after the long hot afternoons in the\nWilhelmsstrasse, where necessarily there was so much that was long and\ntedious. I think even he got tired of Greek frontiers, notwithstanding\nhis sympathy for the country. He did what he could for the Greeks, who\nwere very grateful to him and gave him, in memory of the efforts he made\non their behalf, a fine group in bronze of a female figure--\"Greece\"\nthrowing off the bonds of Turkey. Some of the speakers were very\ninteresting. He found Schouvaloff always a brilliant debater--he spoke\nFrench perfectly, was always good-humoured and courteous, and defended\nhis cause well. One felt there was a latent animosity between the\nEnglish and the Russians. Lord Beaconsfield made one or two strong\nspeeches--very much to the point, and slightly arrogant, but as they\nwere always made in English, they were not understood by all the\nAssembly. W. was always pleased to meet Prince Hohenlohe, actual German\nambassador to Paris (who had been named the third German\nplenipotentiary). He was perfectly au courant of all that went on at\ncourt and in the official world, knew everybody, and introduced W. to\nvarious ladies who received informally, where he could spend an hour or\ntwo quietly, without meeting all his colleagues. Blowitz, of course,\nappeared on the scene--the most important person in Berlin (in his own\nopinion). I am not quite convinced that he saw all the people he said he\ndid, or whether all the extraordinary confidences were made to him which\nhe related to the public, but he certainly impressed people very much,\nand I suppose his letters as newspaper correspondent were quite\nwonderful. He was remarkably intelligent and absolutely unscrupulous,\ndidn't hesitate to put into the mouths of people what he wished them to\nsay, so he naturally had a great pull over the ordinary simple-minded\njournalist who wrote simply what he saw and heard. As he was the Paris\ncorrespondent of _The London Times_, he was often at the French Embassy.\nW. never trusted him very much, and his flair was right, as he was\nanything but true to him. The last days of the Congress were very busy\nones. The negotiations were kept secret enough, but things always leak\nout and the papers had to say something. I was rather emue at the tone\nof the French press, but W. wrote me not to mind--they didn't really\nknow anything, and when the treaty was signed France would certainly\ncome out very honourably. All this has long passed into the domain of\nhistory, and has been told so many times by so many different people\nthat I will not go into details except to say that the French\nprotectorate of Tunis (now one of our most flourishing colonies) was\nentirely arranged by W. in a long confidential conversation with Lord\nSalisbury. The cession of the Island of Cyprus by Turkey to the English\nwas a most unexpected and disagreeable surprise to W. However, he went\ninstantly to Lord Salisbury, who was a little embarrassed, as that\nnegotiation had been kept secret, which didn't seem quite\nfair--everything else having been openly discussed around the council\ntable. He quite understood W.'s feelings in the matter, and was\nperfectly willing to make an arrangement about Tunis. The thing was\nneither understood nor approved at first by the French Government. W.\nreturned to Paris, \"les mains vides; seulement a chercher dans sa poche\non y eut trouve les cles de la Tunisie\"--as one of his friends defined\nthe situation some years ago. He was almost disavowed by his Government.\nThe ministers were timid and unwilling that France should take any\ninitiative--even his friend, Leon Say, then Minister of Finances, a very\nclever man and brilliant politician, said: \"Notre collegue Waddington,\ncontre son habitude, s'est emballe cette fois pour la question de la\nTunisie.\" (Our colleague Waddington, contrary to his nature, has quite\nlost his head this time over the Tunis question.) I think the course of\nevents has fully justified his action, and now that it has proved such a\nsuccess, every one claims to have taken the initiative of the French\nprotectorate of Tunis. All honours have been paid to those who carried\nout the project, and very little is said of the man who originated the\nscheme in spite of great difficulties at home and abroad. Some of W.'s\nfriends know the truth.\n\n[Illustration: The Berlin Congress. From a painting by Anton von Werner,\n1881.]\n\nThere was a great exchange of visits, photographs, and autographs the\nlast days of the Congress. Among other things which W. brought back from\nBerlin, and which will be treasured by his grandsons as a historical\nsouvenir, was a fan, quite a plain wooden fan, with the signatures of\nall the plenipotentiaries--some of them very characteristic. The French\nsignatures are curiously small and distinct, a contrast to Bismarck's\nsmudge. W. was quite sorry to say good-bye to some of his colleagues.\nAndrassy, with his quick sympathies and instant comprehension of all\nsides of a question, attracted him very much. He was a striking\npersonality, quite the Slav type. W. had little private intercourse with\nPrince Gortschakoff--who was already an old man and the type of the\nold-fashioned diplomatist--making very long and well-turned phrases\nwhich made people rather impatient. On the whole W. was satisfied. He\nwrites two or three days before the signing of the treaty: \"As far as I\ncan see at present, no one will be satisfied with the result of the\nCongress; it is perhaps the best proof that it is dealing fairly and\nequitably with the very exaggerated claims and pretensions of all\nparties. Anyhow, France will come out of the whole affair honourably and\nhaving done all that a strictly neutral power can do.\" The treaty was\nsigned on July 13 by all the plenipotentiaries in full uniform. W.\nsaid there was a decided feeling of satisfaction and relief that it was\nfinished. Even Bismarck looked less preoccupied, as if a weight had been\nlifted from his shoulders. Of course he was supposed to have had his own\nway in everything. Everybody (not only the French) was afraid of him.\nWith his iron will, and unscrupulous brushing aside, or even\nannihilating, everything that came in his way, he was a formidable\nadversary. There was a gala dinner at the Schloss, to celebrate the\nsigning of the treaty. \"It was the exact repetition of the first, at the\nopening of the Congress. I sat on the left of Bismarck, and had a good\ndeal of conversation with him. The Crown Prince and Princess were just\nopposite, and the Princess talked a great deal with me across the table,\nalways in English.\" The Crown Princess could never forget that she was\nborn Princess Royal of England. Her household was managed on English\nprinciples, her children brought up by English nurses, she herself\nalways spoke English with them. Of course there must have been many\nthings in Germany which were distasteful to her,--so many of the small\nrefinements of life which are absolute necessaries in England were\nalmost unknown luxuries in Germany,--particularly when she married. Now\nthere has been a great advance in comfort and even elegance in German\nhouses and habits. Her English proclivities made her a great many\nenemies, and I don't believe the \"Iron Chancellor\" made things easy for\nher. The dinner at the Schloss was as usual at six o'clock, and at nine\nW. had to go to take leave of the Empress, who was very French in her\nsympathies, and had always been very kind to him. Her daughter, the\nGrand Duchess of Baden, was there, and W. had a very pleasant hour with\nthe two ladies. The Empress asked him a great many questions about the\nCongress, and particularly about Bismarck--if he was in a fairly good\ntemper--when he had his nerves he was simply impossible, didn't care\nwhat people thought of him, and didn't hesitate to show when he was\nbored. The Grand Duchess added smilingly: \"He is perfectly intolerant,\nhas no patience with a fool.\" I suppose most people are of this opinion.\nI am not personally. I have some nice, foolish, kindly, happy friends of\nboth sexes I am always glad to see; I think they are rather resting in\nthese days of high education and culture and pose. W. finished his\nevening at Lady Salisbury's, who had a farewell reception for all the\nplenipotentiaries. He took leave of his colleagues, all of whom had been\nmost friendly. The only one who was a little stiff with him and\nexpressed no desire to meet him again was Corti, the Italian\nplenipotentiary. He suspected of course that something had been arranged\nabout Tunis, and was much annoyed that he hadn't been able to get\nTripoli for Italy. He was our colleague afterward in London, and there\nwas always a little constraint and coolness in his manner. W. left\nBerlin on the 17th, having been five weeks away.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nGAIETIES AT THE QUAI D'ORSAY\n\nW. got home on the 17th, and was so busy the first days, with his\ncolleagues and political friends that I didn't see much more of him than\nif he had been in Berlin. He was rather disgusted and discouraged at the\nview his colleagues of the cabinet and his friends took of France's\nattitude at the Congress. The only man who seemed to be able to look\nahead a little and understand what a future there might be for France in\nTunis was Gambetta. I remember quite well his telling of an interesting\nconversation with him. Gambetta was very keen about foreign affairs,\nvery patriotic, and not at all willing that France should remain\nindefinitely a weakened power, still suffering from the defeat of 1870.\nThere were many fetes and reunions of all kinds, all through the summer\nmonths, as people had flocked to Paris for the exposition. We remained\nin town until the first days of August, then W. went to his\nConseil-General in the Department of the Aisne, and I went down to\nDeauville. He joined me there, and we had a pleasant month--bathing,\ndriving, and seeing a great many people. We had taken Sir Joseph\nOliffe's villa, one of the best in Deauville. Oliffe, an Englishman, was\none of Emperor Napoleon's physicians, and he and the Duc de Morny were\nthe founders of Deauville, which was very fashionable as long as Morny\nlived and the Empire lasted, but it lost its vogue for some years after\nthe Franco-German War--fashion and society generally congregating at\nTrouville. There were not many villas then, and one rather bad hotel,\nbut the sea was nearer than it is now and people all went to the beach\nin the morning, and fished for shrimps in the afternoon, and led a quiet\nout-of-doors life. There was no polo nor golf nor automobiles--not many\ncarriages, a good tennis-court, where W. played regularly, and races\nevery Sunday in August, which brought naturally a gay young crowd of all\nthe sporting world. The train des maris that left Paris every Saturday\nevening, brought a great many men. It was quite different from the\nDeauville of to-day, which is charming, with quantities of pretty villas\nand gardens and sports of all kinds, but the sea is so far off one has\nto take quite a long walk to get to it, and the mornings on the beach\nand the expeditions to Trouville in the afternoon across the ferry, to\ndo a little shopping in the rue de Paris, are things of the past.\nCuriously enough while I was looking over my notes the other day, I had\na visit from an old friend, the Duc de M., who was one of the inner\ncircle of the imperial household of the Emperor Napoleon III, and took\nan active part in all that went on at court. He had just been hearing\nfrom a friend of the very brilliant season at Deauville this year, and\nthe streams of gold that flowed into the caisse of the management of the\nnew hotel and casino. Every possible luxury and every inducement to\nspend money, racing, gambling, pretty women of all nationalities and\nfacile character, beautifully dressed and covered with jewels, side by\nside with the bearers of some of the proudest names in France. He said\nthat just fifty years ago he went to Deauville with the Duc de Morny,\nPrincesse Metternich, and the Comtesse de Pourteles to inaugurate the\nnew watering-place, then of the simplest description. The ladies were\nbadly lodged in a so-called hotel and he had a room in a\nfisherman's hut.\n\nMarshal MacMahon had a house near Trouville that year, and he came over\noccasionally to see W., always on horseback and early in the morning. W.\nused to struggle into his clothes when \"M. le Marechal\" was announced.\nI think the marshal preferred his military title very much to his civic\nhonours. I suppose there never was so unwilling a president of a\nrepublic, except many years later Casimir Perier, who certainly hated\nthe \"prison of the Elysee,\" but the marshal was a soldier, and his\nmilitary discipline helped him through many difficult positions. We had\nvarious visitors who came down for twenty-four hours--one charming visit\nfrom the Marquis de Vogue, then French ambassador at Vienna, where he\nwas very much liked, a persona grata in every way. He was very tall,\ndistinguished-looking, quite the type of the ambassador. When I went to\ninspect his room I was rather struck by the shortness of the bed--didn't\nthink his long legs could ever get into it. The valet assured me it was\nall right, the bed was normal, but I doubt if he had a very comfortable\nnight. He and W. were old friends, had travelled in the East together\nand discussed every possible subject during long starlight nights in the\ndesert. They certainly never thought then that one day they would be\nclosely associated as ambassador and foreign minister. Vogue didn't like\nthe Republic, didn't believe in the capacity or the sincerity of the\nRepublicans--couldn't understand how W. could. He was a personal friend\nof the marshal's, remained at Vienna during the marshal's presidency,\nbut left with him, much to W.'s regret, who knew what good service he\nhad done at Vienna and what a difficult post that would be for an\nimprovised diplomatist. It was then, and I fancy is still, one of the\nstiffest courts in Europe. One hears amusing stories from some\ndiplomatists of the rigid etiquette in court circles, which the\nAmericans were always infringing. A great friend of mine, an American,\nwho had lived all her life abroad, and whose husband was a member of the\ndiplomatic corps in Vienna, was always worrying over the misdemeanours\nof the Americans who never paid any attention to rules or court\netiquette. They invaded charmed circles, walked boldly up to archdukes\nand duchesses, talking to them cheerfully and easily without waiting to\nbe spoken to, giving them a great deal of information upon all subjects,\nAustrian as well as American, and probably interested the very stiff\nAustrian royalties much more than the ordinary trained diplomatist, who\nwould naturally be more correct in his attitude and conversation. I\nthink the American nationality is the most convenient in the world. The\nAmericans do just as they like, and no one is ever surprised. The\nexplanation is quite simple: \"They are Americans.\" I have often noticed\nlittle faults of manners or breeding, which would shock one in a\nrepresentative of an older civilisation, pass quite unnoticed, or merely\nprovoke a smile of amusement.\n\nWe drove about a great deal--the country at the back of Deauville, going\naway from the sea, is lovely--very like England--charming narrow roads\nwith high banks and hedges on each side--big trees with spreading\nbranches meeting overhead--stretches of green fields with cows grazing\nplacidly and horses and colts gambolling about. It is a great grazing\nand breeding country. There are many haras (breeding stables) in the\nneighbourhood, and the big Norman posters are much in demand. I have\nfriends who never take their horses to the country. They hire for the\nseason a pair of strong Norman horses that go all day up and down hill\nat the same regular pace and who get over a vast amount of country. We\nstopped once or twice when we were a large party, two or three\ncarriages, and had tea at one of the numerous farmhouses that were\nscattered about. Boiling water was a difficulty--milk, cider, good bread\nand butter, cheese we could always find--sometimes a galette, but a\nkettle and boiling water were entirely out of their habits. They used to\nboil the water in a large black pot, and take it out with a big spoon.\nHowever, it amused us, and the water really did boil.\n\nWe had an Italian friend, Count A., who went with us sometimes, and he\nwas very debrouillard, made himself delightful at once to the fermiere\nand got whatever he wanted--chairs and tables set out on the grass, with\nall the cows and colts and chickens walking about quite undisturbed by\nthe unusual sights and sounds. It was all very rustic and a delightful\nchange from the glories of the exposition and official life. It amused\nme perfectly to see W. with a straw hat, sitting on a rather rickety\nthree-legged stool, eating bread and butter and jam. Once or twice some\nof W.'s secretaries came down with despatches, and he had a good\nmorning's work, but on the whole the month passed lazily and pleasantly.\n\nWe went back to Paris about the 10th of September, and remained there\nuntil the end of the exposition. Paris was again crowded with\nforeigners--the month of October was beautiful, bright and warm, and the\nafternoons at the exposition were delightful at the end of the day, when\nthe crowd had dispersed a little and the last rays of the setting sun\nlingered on the Meudon Hills and the river. The buildings and costumes\nlost their tawdry look, and one saw only a mass of moving colour, which\nseemed to soften and lose itself in the evening shadows. There were\nvarious closing entertainments. The marshal gave a splendid fete at\nVersailles. We drove out and had some difficulty in making our way\nthrough the crowd of carriages, soldiers, police, and spectators that\nlined the road. It was a beautiful sight as we got near the palace,\nwhich was a blaze of light. The terraces and gardens were also\nilluminated, and the effect of the little lamps hidden away in the\nbranches of the old trees, cut into all sorts of fantastic shapes, was\nquite wonderful. There were not as many people at the entrance of the\npalace as we had expected to find, for the invitations had been most\ngenerously given to all nationalities. At first the rooms, which were\nbrilliantly lighted, looked almost empty. The famous Galerie des Glaces\nwas quite enchanting, almost too light, if there can be too much light\nat a fete. There were very few people in it when we arrived rather\nearly--so much so that when I said to M. de L., one of the marshal's\naides-de-camp, \"How perfectly beautiful it is, even now, empty; what\nwill it be when all the uniforms and jewels are reflected in the\nmirrors,\" his answer was: \"Ah, Madame, I am afraid we shan't have people\nenough, the hall is so enormous.\"\n\nI thought of him afterward when an angry crowd was battering at the\ndoors of one of the salons where the royalties were having refreshments.\nI don't think they realised, and we certainly didn't, what the noise\nmeant, but some of the marshal's household, who knew that only a slight\ntemporary partition was between us and an irate mob, struggling up the\nstaircase, were green with anxiety. However, the royalties all got away\nwithout any difficulty, and we tried to hurry immediately after them,\nbut a dense crowd was then pouring into the room at each end, and for a\nmoment things looked ugly. The gentlemen, my husband and my\nbrother-in-law, Eugene Schuyler, Lord Lyons, British ambassador (a big\nsquare-shouldered man), and one or two others, put us, my sister\nSchuyler and me, in a recess of one of the big windows, with heavy\nfurniture in front of us, but that was not very pleasant--with the crowd\nmoving both ways closing in upon us--and the men were getting nervous,\nso one of our secretaries squeezed through the crowd and found two or\nthree huissiers, came back with them, and we made a procession--two big\nhuissiers in front, with their silver chains and swords, the mark of\nofficial status, which always impresses a French crowd, then Lord Lyons,\nmy sister, and I, then W. and Schuyler, and two more men behind us--and\nwith considerable difficulty and a good many angry expostulations, we\nmade our way out. Happily our carriages and servants with our wraps were\nwaiting in one of the inner courts, and we got away easily enough, but\nthe evening was disastrous to most of the company.\n\nThere must have been some misunderstanding between the marshal's\nhousehold and the officials at Versailles, as but one staircase (and\nthere are several) was opened to the public, which was of course\nabsolutely insufficient. Why others were not opened and lighted will\nalways be a mystery. Every one got jammed in the one narrow\nstairway--people jostled and tumbled over each other--some of the women\nfainted and were carried out, borne high aloft over the heads of the\nstruggling multitudes, and many people never saw their cloaks again. The\nvestiaire was taken by storm--satin and lace cloaks lying on the ground,\ntrampled upon by everybody, and at the end, various men not having been\nable to find their coats were disporting themselves in pink satin cloaks\nlined with swan's-down--over their shoulders. Quantities of people never\ngot into the palace--not even on the staircase. The landing was directly\nopposite the room where the princes had their buffet--and if they had\nsucceeded in forcing the door, it would have been a catastrophe. While\nwe were standing in the window, looking into the park, which looked an\nenchanted garden, with the lights and flowers--we wondered if we could\njump or climb down if the crowd pressed too much upon us, but it was too\nhigh and there were no projecting balconies to serve as stepping-stones.\nIt was a very unpleasant experience.\n\nWe were giving a ball at the Quai d'Orsay a few nights afterward, and\nhad also asked a great many people--all the ambassadors sent in very\nlarge lists of invitations they wanted for their compatriots, but much\nthe largest was that sent in by the American minister. The invitations\nsent to the United States Legation (as it was then) were something\nfabulous. It seemed to me the whole of the United States were in Paris\nand expecting to be entertained. It is a very difficult position for the\nAmerican representative on these occasions. Everybody can't be invited\nto the various entertainments and distinctions are very hard to make. We\nhad some amusing experiences. W. had a letter from one of his English\nfriends, Lord H., saying he was coming to Paris for the fetes, with his\ntwo daughters, and he would like very much to be invited to some of the\nparties at the Elysee and the ministries. W. replied, saying he would\ndo what he could, and added that we were to have two large dinners and\nreceptions,--one with the Comedie Francaise afterward and one with\nmusic--which one would they come to. Lord H. promptly replied, \"to\nboth.\" It was funny, but really didn't make any difference. When you\nhave a hundred people to dinner you can quite easily have a hundred and\nthree, and in such large parties, arranged weeks beforehand, some one\nalways gives out at the last moment.\n\nWe had a great many discussions in W.'s cabinet with two of his\nsecretaries, who were especially occupied with the invitations for our\nball. The Parliament of course (le peuple souverain) was invited, but it\nwas a different question for the women, wives of the senators and\ndeputies. We finally arrived at a solution by inviting only the wives I\nknew. We had an indignant response from one gentleman: \"M. X., Depute,\nne valsant qu'avec sa femme, a l'honneur de renvoyer la carte\nd'invitation que le Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres et Madame\nWaddington lui ont adressee pour la soiree du 28....\" (Mr. X., Deputy,\nwho waltzes only with his wife, has the honour to send back the card of\ninvitation which the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Madame Waddington\nhave sent to him for the party of the 28... ) It was unanimously\ndecided that the couple must be invited--a gentleman who went to balls\nonly to dance with his wife must be encouraged in such exemplary\nbehaviour. Another was funny too, in a different style: \"Madame K.,\netant au ciel depuis quelques annees, ne pourrait pas se rendre a la\ngracieuse invitation que le Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres et Madame\nWaddington ont bien voulu lui adresser. Monsieur K. s'y rendra avec\nplaisir.\"... (Madame K., being in heaven for some years, cannot accept\nthe amiable invitation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Madame\nWaddington. Mr. K. will come with pleasure.) We kept the letters in our\narchives with many other curious specimens. The house was given over to\nworkmen the last two or three days before the ball. With the remembrance\nof the staircase at Versailles in our minds, we were most anxious to\nhave no contretemps of any kind to interfere with our entertainment.\nBoth entrances were arranged and the old elevator (which had not worked\nfor years) was put in order. It had been suggested once or twice that I\nshould use it, but as I always had heard a gruesome tale of Madame\nDrouyn de l'Huys, when her husband was Foreign Minister, hanging in\nspace for four or five hours between the two floors, I was not inclined\nto repeat that experience.\n\nMy recollection of the lower entrance and staircase, which we never\nused, was of rather a dark, grimy corner, and I was amazed the morning\nof the ball to see the transformation. Draperies, tapestries, flags, and\ngreen plants had done wonders--and the elevator looked quite charming\nwith red velvet hangings and cushions. I don't think any one used it. We\nhad asked our guests at nine-thirty, as the princes said they would come\nat ten. I was ready about nine, and thought I would go down-stairs by\nthe lower entrance, so as to have a look at the staircase and all the\nrooms before any one came. There was already such a crowd in the rooms\nthat I couldn't get through; even my faithful Gerard could not make a\npassage. We were obliged to send for two huissiers, who with some\ndifficulty made room for me. W. and his staff were already in the salon\nreserve, giving final instructions. The servants told us that since\neight o'clock there had been a crowd at the doors, which they opened a\nlittle before nine, and a flood of people poured in. The salon reserve\nhad a blue ribbon stretched across the entrance from door to door, and\nwas guarded by huissiers, old hands who knew everybody in the diplomatic\nand official world, and would not let any one in who hadn't a right to\npenetrate into the charmed circle (which of course became the one room\nwhere every one wanted to go). There were, too, one or two members of\nW.'s cabinet always stationed near the doors to see that instructions\nwere obeyed.\n\nI don't think the salon reserve exists any more--the blue ribbon\ncertainly not. The rising flood of democracy and equality wouldn't\nsubmit to any such barrier. I remember quite well one beautiful woman\nstanding for some time just the wrong side of the ribbon. She was so\nbeautiful that every one remarked her, but she had no official rank or\nclaim of any kind to enter the salon reserve--no one knew her, though\nevery one was asking who she was. She finally made her entree into the\nroom on the arm of one of the members of the diplomatic corps, a young\nsecretary, one of her friends, who could not refuse her what she wanted\nso much. She was certainly the handsomest woman in the room with the\nexception of the actual Queen Alexandra, who was always the most\nbeautiful and distinguished wherever she was.\n\nThe royalties didn't dance much. We had the regular quadrille d'honneur\nwith the Princes and Princesses of Wales, Denmark, Sweden, Countess of\nFlanders, and others. None of the French princes came to the ball.\nThere was a great crowd, but as the distinguished guests remained all\nthe time in the salon reserve, they were not inconvenienced by it. Just\nbefore supper, which was served at little round tables in a room opening\nout of the rotonde, the late King of Denmark, then Crown Prince, brother\nof the Princess of Wales, told me he would like to go up-stairs and see\nall the rooms; he had always heard that the Palais d'Orsay was a\nbeautiful house. We made a difficult but stately progress through the\nrooms. The staircase was a pretty sight, covered with a red carpet,\ntapestries on the walls, and quantities of pretty women of all\nnationalities grouped on the steps. We walked through the rooms, where\nthere were just as many people as there were down-stairs, an orchestra,\nsupper-room, people dancing--just like another party going on. We halted\na few minutes in my petit salon at the end of the long suite of rooms.\nIt looked quite charming, with the blue brocade walls and quantities of\npink roses standing in high glass vases. I suggested taking the elevator\nto go down, but the prince preferred walking (so did I). It was even\nmore difficult getting through the crowd down-stairs--we had the whole\nlength of the house to cross. Several women stood on chairs as we passed\nalong, in the hope of seeing one of the princesses, but they had wisely\nremained in the salon reserve, and were afraid to venture into\nthe crowd.\n\nSupper was a serious preoccupation for the young secretaries of the\nministry, who had much difficulty in keeping that room private. Long\nbefore the supper hour some enterprising spirits had discovered that the\nroyalties were to sup in that room, and finding the secretaries quite\ninaccessible to any suggestions of \"people who had a right to come\nin\"--presidents of commissions and various other distinctions--had\nrecourse to the servants, and various gold pieces circulated, which,\nhowever, did not accomplish their object. The secretaries said that they\nhad more trouble with the chamberlains of the various princes than with\nthe princes themselves; they all wanted to sup in the private room, and\nwere much more tenacious of having a good place, or the place they\nthought was due to them, than their royal masters. The supper was very\ngay--the Prince of Wales (the late King Edward) perfectly\ncharming--talking to every one, remembering every one with that\nextraordinary gracious manner which made him friends in all classes.\nImmediately after supper the princes and distinguished strangers and W.\ndeparted. I remained about an hour longer and went to have a look at\nthe ballroom. It was still crowded, people dancing hard, and when\nfinally about two o'clock I retreated to my own quarters, I went to\nsleep to the sound of waltzes and dance music played by the two\norchestras. The revelry continued pretty well all through the night.\nWhenever I woke I heard strains of music. Supper went on till seven in\nthe morning. Our faithful Kruft told us that there was absolutely\nnothing left on the tables, and they had almost to force the people out,\ntelling them that an invitation to a ball did not usually extend to\nbreakfast the next morning.\n\nThere was a grand official closing of the exposition at the end of\nNovember, with a distribution of prizes--the city still very full and\nvery gay--escorts and uniforms in every direction--the Champs-Elysees\nbrilliant with soldiers--equipages of all descriptions, and all the\nafternoon a crowd of people sitting under the trees, much interested in\nall that was going on, particularly when carriages would pass with\npeople in foreign and striking costumes. The Chinese always wore their\ncostume; the big yellow birds of paradise became quite a feature of the\nafternoon defile. An Indian princess too, dressed entirely in white--a\nsoft clinging material, with a white veil, _not_ over her face, and\nheld in place by a gold band going around the head--was always much\nadmired. Every now and then there would be a great clatter of\ntrotting-horses and jingling sabres, when an escort of dragoons would\npass, escorting some foreign prince to the Elysee to pay his formal\nvisit to the marshal. Everybody looked gay--French people so dearly love\na show--and it was amusing to see the interest every one took in the\nsteady stream of people, from the fashionable woman driving to the Bois\nin her victoria to the workmen, who would stand in groups on the corners\nof the streets--some of them occasionally with a child on their\nshoulders. Frenchmen of all classes are good to children. On a Sunday or\nfete day, when whole families are coming in from a day at the Bois, one\noften sees a young husband wheeling a baby-carriage, or carrying a baby\nin his arms to let the poor mother have a rest. It was curious at the\nend of the exposition to see how quickly everything was removed (many\nthings had been sold); and in a few days the Champ de Mars took again\nthe same aspect it had at the beginning of the month of May--heavy carts\nand camions everywhere, oceans of mud, lines of black holes where trees\nand poles had been planted, and the same groups of small shivering\nSoutherners, all huddled together, wrapped in wonderful cloaks and\nblankets, quite paralysed with cold. I don't know if the exposition was\na financial success--I should think probably not. A great deal of money\ncame into France (but the French spent enormously in their preparations)\nbut the moral effect was certainly good--all the world flocked to Paris.\nCabs and river steamers did a flourishing business, as did all the\nrestaurants and cafes in the suburbs. St. Cloud, Meudon, Versailles,\nRobinson, were crowded every night with people who were thirsting for\nair and food after long hot days in the dust and struggles of the\nexposition. We dined there once or twice, but it was certainly neither\npleasant nor comfortable--even in the most expensive restaurants. They\nwere all overcrowded, very bad service, badly lighted, and generally bad\nfood. There were various national repasts--Russian, Italian, etc.--but I\nnever participated in any of those, except once at the American\nrestaurant, where I had a very good breakfast one morning, with\ndelicious waffles made by a <DW64> cook. I was rather glad when the\nexhibition was over. One had a feeling that one ought to see as much as\npossible, and there were some beautiful things, but it was most\nfatiguing struggling through the crowd, and we invariably lost the\ncarriage and found ourselves at the wrong entrance, and had to wait\nhours for a cab. Tiffany had a great success with the French. Many of my\nfriends bought souvenirs of the exposition from him. His work was very\noriginal, fanciful, and quite different from the rather stiff, heavy,\nclassic silver that one sees in this country.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nM. WADDINGTON AS PRIME MINISTER\n\nThere had been a respite, a sort of armed truce, in political circles as\nlong as the exposition lasted, but when the Chambers met again in\nNovember, it was evident that things were not going smoothly. The\nRepublicans and Radicals were dissatisfied. Every day there were\nspeeches and insinuations against the marshal and his government, and\none felt that a crisis was impending. There were not loaves and fishes\nenough for the whole Radical party. If one listened to them it would\nseem as if every prefet and every general were conspiring against the\nRepublic. There were long consultations in W.'s cabinet, and I went\noften to our house in the rue Dumont d'Urville to see if everything was\nin order there, as I quite expected to be back there for Christmas. A\nclimax was reached when the marshal was asked to sign the deposition of\nsome of the generals. He absolutely refused--the ministers persisted in\ntheir demands. There was not much discussion, the marshal's mind was\nmade up, and on the 30th of January, 1879, he announced in the Conseil\ndes Ministres his irrevocable decision, and handed his ministers his\nletter of resignation.\n\nWe had a melancholy breakfast--W., Count de P., and I--the last day of\nthe marshal's presidency. W. was very blue, was quite sure the marshal\nwould resign, and foresaw all sorts of complications both at home and\nabroad. The day was gloomy too, grey and cold, even the big rooms of the\nministry were dark. As soon as they had started for Versailles, I took\nbaby and went to mother's. As I went over the bridge I wondered how many\nmore times I should cross it, and whether the end of the week would see\nme settled again in my own house. We drove about and had tea together,\nand I got back to the Quai d'Orsay about six o'clock. Neither W. nor\nCount de P. had got back from Versailles, but there were two\ntelegrams--the first one to say that the marshal had resigned, the\nsecond one that Grevy was named in his place, with a large majority.\n\n[Illustration: M. Jules Grevy, reading Marshal MacMahon's letter of\nresignation to the Chamber of Deputies. From _L'Illustration_,\nFebruary 8. 1879.]\n\nW. was rather depressed when he came home--he had always a great\nsympathy and respect for the marshal, and was very sorry to see him\ngo,--thought his departure would complicate foreign affairs. As long as\nthe marshal was at the Elysee, foreign governments were not afraid of\ncoups d'etat or revolutions. He was also sorry that Dufaure would not\nremain, but he was an old man, had had enough of political life and\nparty struggles--left the field to younger men. The marshal's letter was\ncommunicated at once to the Parliament, and the houses met in the\nafternoon. There was a short session to hear the marshal's letter read\n(by Grevy in the Chamber of Deputies) and the two houses, Senate and\nChamber of Deputies, were convoked for a later hour of the same\nafternoon. There was not much excitement, two or three names were\npronounced, but every one felt sure that Grevy would be the man. He was\nnominated by a large majority, and the Republicans were\njubilant--thought the Republic was at last established on a firm and\nproper basis. Grevy was perfectly calm and self-possessed--did not show\nmuch enthusiasm. He must have felt quite sure from the first moment that\nhe would be named. His first visitor was the marshal, who wished him all\npossible success in his new mission, and, if Grevy was pleased to be the\nPresident of the Republic, the marshal was even more pleased not to be,\nand to take up his private life again.\n\nThere were many speculations as to who would be charged by Grevy to form\nhis first cabinet--and almost permanent meetings in all the groups of\nthe Left. W.'s friends all said he would certainly remain at the Foreign\nOffice, but that depended naturally upon the choice of the premier. If\nhe were taken from the more advanced ranks of the Left, W. could not\npossibly stay. We were not long in suspense. W. had one or two\ninterviews with Grevy, which resulted in his remaining at the Foreign\nOffice, but as prime minister. W. hesitated at first, felt that it would\nnot be an easy task to keep all those very conflicting elements\ntogether. There were four Protestants in the ministry, W., Leon Say, de\nFreycinet, and Le Royer. Jules Ferry, who took the Ministry of Public\nInstruction, a very clever man, was practically a freethinker, and the\nParliament was decidedly more advanced. The last elections had given a\nstrong Republican majority to the Senate. He consulted with his brother,\nRichard Waddington, then a deputy, afterward a senator, president of the\nChamber of Commerce of Rouen, and some of his friends, and finally\ndecided to accept the very honourable, but very onerous position, and\nremained at the Foreign Affairs with Grevy, as prime minister.\n\nIf I had seen little of him before, I saw nothing of him now, as his\nwork was exactly doubled. We did breakfast together, but it was a most\nirregular meal--sometimes at twelve o'clock, sometimes at one-thirty,\nand very rarely alone. We always dined out or had people dining with us,\nso that family life became a dream of the past. We very rarely went\ntogether when we dined out. W. was always late--his coupe waited hours\nin the court. I had my carriage and went alone. After eight or ten days\nof irregular meals at impossible hours (we often dined at nine-thirty) I\nsaid to Count de P., W.'s chef de cabinet: \"Can't you arrange to have\nbusiness over a little earlier? It is awful to dine so late and to wait\nso long,\" to which he replied: \"Ah, madame, no one can be more desirous\nthan I to change that order of things, for when the minister dines at\nnine-thirty, the chef de cabinet gets his dinner at ten-thirty.\" We did\nmanage to get rather more satisfactory hours after a little while, but\nit was always difficult to extract W. from his work if it were anything\nimportant. He became absorbed, and absolutely unconscious of time.\n\nThe new President, Grevy, installed himself at once at the Elysee with\nhis wife and daughter. There was much speculation about Madame Grevy--no\none had ever seen her--she was absolutely unknown. When Grevy was\npresident of the National Assembly, he gave very pleasant men's\ndinners, where Madame Grevy never appeared. Every one (of all opinions)\nwas delighted to go to him, and the talk was most brilliant and\ninteresting. Grevy was a perfect host, very cultivated, with a\nmarvellous memory--quoting pages of the classics, French, and Latin.\n\nMadame Grevy was always spoken of as a quiet, unpretending\nperson--occupied with domestic duties, who hated society and never went\nanywhere--in fact, no one ever heard her name mentioned. A great many\npeople didn't know that Grevy had a wife. When her husband became\nPresident of the Republic, there was much discussion as to Madame\nGrevy's social status in the official world. I don't think Grevy wanted\nher to appear nor to take any part in the new life, and she certainly\ndidn't want to. Nothing in her former life had prepared her for such a\nchange, and it was always an effort for her, but both were overruled by\ntheir friends, who thought a woman was a necessary part of the position.\nIt was some little time before they were settled at the Elysee. W. asked\nGrevy once or twice when Madame Waddington might call upon his wife--and\nhe answered that as soon as they were quite installed I should receive a\nnotice. One day a communication arrived from the Elysee, saying that\nMadame Grevy would receive the diplomatic corps and the ministers' wives\non a fixed day at five o'clock. The message was sent on to the\ndiplomatic corps, and when I arrived on the appointed day (early, as I\nwanted to see the people come in, and also thought I must present the\nforeign ladies) there were already several carriages in the court.\n\n[Illustration: M. Jules Grevy elected President of the Republic by the\nSenate and Chamber of Deputies meeting as the National Assembly. From\n_l'Illustration_, February 8. 1879.]\n\nThe Elysee looked just as it did in the marshal's time--plenty of\nservants in gala liveries--two or three huissiers who knew\neverybody--palms, flowers, everywhere. The traditions of the palace are\ncarried on from one President to another, and a permanent staff of\nservants remains. We found Madame Grevy with her daughter and one or two\nladies, wives, I suppose, of the secretaries, seated in the well-known\ndrawing-room with the beautiful tapestries--Madame Grevy in a large gold\narmchair at the end of the room--a row of gilt armchairs on each side of\nhers--mademoiselle standing behind her mother. A huissier announced\nevery one distinctly, but the names and titles said nothing to Madame\nGrevy. She was tall, middle-aged, handsomely dressed, and visibly\nnervous--made a great many gestures when she talked. It was amusing to\nsee all the people arrive. I had nothing to do--there were no\nintroductions--every one was announced, and they all walked straight up\nto Madame Grevy, who was very polite, got up for every one, men and\nwomen. It was rather an imposing circle that gathered around\nher--Princess Hohenlohe, German ambassadress, sat on one side of\nher--Marquise Molins, Spanish ambassadress, on the other. There were not\nmany men--Lord Lyons, as doyen of the diplomatic corps, the nonce, and a\ngood many representatives of the South American Republics. Madame Grevy\nwas perfectly bewildered, and did try to talk to the ladies next to her,\nbut it was an intimidating function for any one, and she had no one to\nhelp her, as they were all quite new to the work. It was obviously an\nimmense relief to her when some lady of the official world came in, whom\nshe had known before. The two ladies plunged at once into a very\nanimated conversation about their children, husbands, and various\ndomestic matters--a perfectly natural conversation, but not interesting\nto the foreign ladies.\n\nWe didn't make a very long visit--it was merely a matter of form. Lord\nLyons came out with me, and we had quite a talk while I was waiting for\nmy carriage in the anteroom. He was so sensible always in his\nintercourse with the official world, quite realised that the position\nwas difficult and trying for Madame Grevy--it would have been for any\none thrown at once without any preparation into such perfectly different\nsurroundings. He had a certain experience of republics and republican\nmanners, as he had been some years in Washington as British minister,\nand had often seen wives of American statesmen and ministers, fresh from\nthe far West, beginning their career in Washington, quite bewildered by\nthe novelty of everything and utterly ignorant of all questions of\netiquette--only he said the American women were far more adaptable than\neither French or English--or than any others in the world, in fact. He\nalso said that day, and I have heard him repeat it once or twice since,\nthat he had _never_ met a stupid American woman....\n\nI have always thought it was unnecessary to insist upon Madame Grevy's\npresence at the Elysee. It is very difficult for any woman, no longer\nvery young, to begin an entirely new life in a perfectly different\nmilieu, and certainly more difficult for a Frenchwoman of the\nbourgeoisie than any other. They live in such a narrow circle, their\nlives are so cramped and uninteresting--they know so little of society\nand foreign ways and manners that they must be often uncomfortable and\nmake mistakes. It is very different for a man. All the small questions\nof dress and manners, etc., don't exist for him. One man in a dress coat\nand white cravat looks very like another, and men of all conditions are\npolite to a lady. When a man is intelligent, no one notices whether his\ncoat and waist-coat are too wide or too short and whether his boots\nare clumsy.\n\nMadame Grevy never looked happy at the Elysee. They had a big dinner\nevery Thursday, with a reception afterward, and she looked so tired when\nshe was sitting on the sofa, in the diplomatic salon, making\nconversation for the foreigners and people of all kinds who came to\ntheir receptions, that one felt really sorry for her. Grevy was always a\nstriking personality. He had a fine head, a quiet, dignified manner, and\nlooked very well when he stood at the door receiving his guests. I don't\nthink he cared very much about foreign affairs--he was essentially\nFrench--had never lived abroad or known any foreigners. He was too\nintelligent not to understand that a country must have foreign\nrelations, and that France must take her place again as a great power,\nbut home politics interested him much more than anything else. He was a\ncharming talker--every one wanted to talk to him, or rather to listen to\nhim. The evenings were pleasant enough in the diplomatic salon. It was\ninteresting to see the attitude of the different diplomatists. All were\ncorrect, but most of them were visibly antagonistic to the Republic and\nthe Republicans (which they considered much accentuee since the\nnomination of Grevy--the women rather more so than the men). One felt,\nif one didn't hear, the criticisms on the dress, deportment, and general\nstyle of the Republican ladies.\n\n[Illustration: The Elysee Palace, Paris]\n\nI didn't quite understand their view of the situation. They were all\ndelighted to come to Paris, and knew perfectly well the state of things,\nwhat an abyss existed between all the Conservative party, Royalists and\nBonapartists, and the Republican, but the absence of a court didn't make\nany difference in their position. They went to all the entertainments\ngiven in the Faubourg St. Germain, and all the societe came to theirs.\nWith very few exceptions they did only what was necessary in the way of\nintercourse with the official world. I think they made a mistake, both\nfor themselves and their governments. France was passing through an\nentirely new phase; everything was changing, many young intelligent men\nwere coming to the front, and there were interesting and able\ndiscussions in the Chambers, and in the salons of the Republican\nministers and deputies. I dare say the new theories of liberty and\nequality were not sympathetic to the trained representatives of courts,\nbut the world was advancing, democracy was in the air, and one would\nhave thought it would have interested foreigners to follow the movement\nand to judge for themselves whether the young Republic had any chance of\nlife. One can hardly imagine a public man not wishing to hear all sides\nof a question, but I think, _certainly_ in the beginning, there was such\na deep-rooted distrust and dislike to the Republic, that it was\nimpossible to see things fairly. I don't know that it mattered very\nmuch. In these days of rapid travelling and telephone, an ambassador's\nrole is much less important than in the old days when an ambassador with\nhis numerous suite of secretaries and servants, travelling by post,\nwould be days on the road before reaching his destination, and when all\nsorts of things might happen, kingdoms and dynasties be overthrown in\nthe interval. Now all the great measures and negotiations are discussed\nand settled in the various chancelleries--the ambassador merely\ntransmits his instructions.\n\nI think the women were rather more uncompromising than the men. One day\nin my drawing-room there was a lively political discussion going on, and\none heard all the well-known phrases \"le gouvernement infect,\" \"no\ngentleman could serve the Republic,\" etc. I wasn't paying much\nattention--never did; I had become accustomed to that style of\nconversation, and knew exactly what they were all going to say, when I\nheard one of my friends, an American-born, married to a Frenchman of\nvery good old family, make the following statement: \"Toute la canaille\nest Republicaine.\" That was really too much, and I answered: \"Vous etes\nbien indulgente pour l'Empire.\" When one thinks of the unscrupulous (not\nto use a stronger term) and needy adventurers, who made the Coup d'Etat\nand played a great part in the court of the Second Empire, it was really\na little startling to be told that the Republicans enjoyed the monopoly\nof the canaille. However, I suppose nothing is so useless as a political\ndiscussion (except perhaps a religious one). No one ever converts any\none else. I have always heard it said that the best political speech\nnever changed a vote.\n\nThe first person who entertained Grevy was Prince Hohenlohe, the German\nambassador. They had a brilliant reception, rooms crowded, all the\nofficial world and a fair contingent from the Faubourg St. Germain. The\nPresident brought his daughter with him (Madame Grevy never accepted any\ninvitations) and they walked through the rooms arm-in-arm, mademoiselle\ndeclining the arm of Count Wesdehlen, first secretary of the\nGerman Embassy.\n\nHowever, she was finally prevailed upon to abandon the paternal support,\nand then Wesdehlen installed her in a small salon where Mollard,\nIntroducteur des Ambassadeurs, took charge of her and introduced a great\nmany men to her. No woman would ask to be introduced to an unmarried\nwoman, and that of course made her position difficult. The few ladies\nshe had already seen at the Elysee came up to speak to her, but didn't\nstay near her, so she was really receiving almost alone with Mollard.\nGrevy was in another room, tres entoure, as he always was. The\ndiplomatic corps did not spare their criticisms. Madame Grevy received\nevery Saturday in the afternoon, and I went often--not every time. It\nwas a funny collection of people, some queerly dressed women and one or\ntwo men in dress coats and white cravats,--always a sprinkling of\ndiplomatists. Prince Orloff was often there, and if anybody could have\nmade that stiff, shy semicircle of women comfortable, he would have done\nit, with his extraordinary ease of manner and great habit of the world.\nGambetta was installed in the course of the month at the Palais Bourbon,\nnext to us. It was brilliantly lighted every night, and my chef told me\none of his friends, an excellent cook, was engaged, and that there would\nbe a great many dinners. The Palais Bourbon had seen great\nentertainments in former days, when the famous Duc de Morny was\nPresident de la Chambre des Deputes. Under Napoleon III his\nentertainments were famous. The whole world, fashionable, political, and\ndiplomatic thronged his salons, and invitations were eagerly sought for\nnot only by the French people, but by the many foreigners who passed\nthrough Paris at that time. Gambetta must have been a curious contrast\nto the Duc de Morny.\n\nWe went to see a first function at the Elysee some time in February, two\nCardinals were to be named and Grevy was to deliver the birettas.\nMollard asked to see me one morning, telling me that the two ablegates\nwith their suite had arrived, and wished to pay their respects to me.\nOne of them was Monsignor Cataldi, whom we had known well in Rome when\nwe were living there. He was a friend of my brother (General Rufus King,\nthe last United States minister to the Vatican under Pia Nono), and came\noften to the house. He was much excited when he found out that Madame\nWaddington was the Mary King he had known so well in Rome. He had with\nhim an English priest, whose name, curiously enough, was English. They\nappeared about tea-time and were quite charming, Cataldi just as fat and\ncheerful and talkative as I remembered him in the old days in Rome. We\nplunged at once into all sorts of memories of old times--the good old\ntimes when Rome was small and black and interesting--something quite\napart and different from any other place in the world. Monsignor English\nwas much younger and more reserved, the Anglo-Saxon type--a contrast to\nthe exuberant Southerners. We asked them to dine the next night and were\nable to get a few interesting people to meet them, Comte et Comtesse de\nSartiges, and one or two deputies--bien-pensants. Sartiges was formerly\nFrench ambassador in Rome to the Vatican, and a very clever diplomatist.\nHe was very autocratic, did exactly what he liked. I remember quite well\nsome of his small dances at the embassy. The invitations were from ten\nto twelve, and at twelve precisely the musicians stopped playing--no\nmatter who was dancing, the ball was over. His wife was an American,\nfrom Boston, Miss Thorndike, who always retained the simple, natural\nmanner of the well-born American. Their son, the Vicomte de Sartiges,\nhas followed in his father's footsteps, and is one of the most serious\nand intelligent of the young diplomatists.\n\nCataldi made himself very agreeable, spoke French perfectly well, though\nwith a strong Italian accent. He confided to me after dinner that he\nwould have liked to see some of the more advanced political men, instead\nof the very conservative Catholics we had invited to meet them. \"I know\nwhat these gentlemen think; I would like to talk to some of the others,\nthose who think 'le clericalism c'est l'ennemi,' and who are firmly\nconvinced that the soutane serves as a cloak for all sorts of underhand\nand unpatriotic dealings; I can only see them abroad, never in Rome.\" He\nwould have talked to them quite easily. Italians have so much natural\ntact, in discussing difficult questions, never irritate people\nunnecessarily.\n\nW. enjoyed his evening. He had never been in Rome, nor known many\nRomans, and it amused him to see how skilfully Cataldi (who was a\ndevoted admirer of Leo XIII) avoided all cross-currents and difficult\nquestions, saying only what he intended to say, and appreciating all\nthat was said to him.\n\nHenrietta and I were very anxious to see the ceremony at the Elysee, and\nasked Mollard, Introducteur des Ambassadeurs and chef du Protocole--a\nmost important man on all official occasions, if he couldn't put us\nsomewhere in a corner, where we could see, without taking any part. W.\nwas of no use to us, as he went officially, in uniform. Madame Grevy was\nvery amiable, and sent us an invitation to breakfast. We found a small\nparty assembled in the tapestry salon when we arrived at the Elysee--the\nPresident with all his household, civil and military, Madame and\nMademoiselle Grevy, three or four ladies, wives of the aides-de-camp and\nsecretaries, also several prominent ecclesiastics, among them Monsignor\nCapel, an English priest, a very handsome and attractive man, whom we\nhad known well in Rome. He was supposed to have made more women converts\nto Catholicism than any man of his time; I can quite understand his\ninfluence with women. There was something very natural and earnest about\nhim--no pose. I had not seen him since I had married and was very\npleased when I recognised him. He told me he had never seen W.--was most\nanxious to make his acquaintance.\n\nWhile we were talking, W. came in, looking very warm and uncomfortable,\nwearing his stiff, gold-embroidered uniform, which changed him very\nmuch. I introduced Capel to him at once. They had quite a talk before\nthe Archbishops and ablegates arrived. The two future Cardinals,\nMonseigneur Pie, Archbishop of Poitiers, and Monseigneur Desprey,\nArchbishop of Toulouse, were well known in the Catholic world. The\nPope's choice was generally approved. They were treated with all due\nceremony, as befitted princes of the church. One of the Elysee carriages\n(always very well turned out), with an escort of cavalry, went to fetch\nthem, and they looked very stately and imposing in their robes when they\ncame into the room where we were waiting. They were very different,\nMonseigneur Pie tall, thin, cold, arrogant,--one felt it was a trial for\nhim to receive his Cardinal's hat from the hands of a Republican\nPresident. Monseigneur Desprey had a kind good expression. I don't think\nhe liked it much either, but he put a better face on the matter.\n\nBoth Cardinals said exactly what one imagined they would say--that the\ntraditional fidelity of France to the church should be supported and\nencouraged in every way in these troubled days of indifference to\nreligion, etc. One felt all the time the strong antagonism of the church\nto the Republic. Grevy answered extremely well, speaking with much\ndignity and simplicity, and assuring the Cardinals that they could\nalways count upon the constitutional authority of the head of the state,\nin favour of the rights of the church. I was quite pleased to see again\nthe red coats and high boots of the gardes nobles. It is a very showy,\ndashing uniform. The two young men were good-looking and wore it very\nwell. I asked to have them presented to me, and we had a long talk over\nold days in Rome when the Pope went out every day to the different\nvillas, and promenades, and always with an escort of gardes nobles. I\ninvited them to our reception two or three nights afterward, and they\nseemed to enjoy themselves. They were, of course, delighted with their\nshort stay in Paris, and I think a little surprised at the party at the\nForeign Office under a Republican regime. I don't know if they expected\nto find the rooms filled with gentlemen in the traditional red\nGaribaldian shirt--and ladies in corresponding simplicity of attire.\n\n[Illustration: Her Majesty Queen Victoria, about 1879. From a photograph\nby Chancellor, Dublin.]\n\nWe saw a great many English at the Quai d'Orsay. Queen Victoria stayed\none or two nights at the British Embassy, passing through Paris on her\nway South. She sent for W., who had never seen her since his\nundergraduate days at Cambridge. He found her quite charming, very easy,\ninterested in everything. She began the conversation in French--(he was\nannounced with all due ceremony as Monsieur le Ministre des Affaires\nEtrangeres) and W. said she spoke it remarkably well,--then, with her\nbeautiful smile which lightened up her whole face: \"I think I can\nspeak English with a Cambridge scholar.\" She was much interested in his\nbeginnings in England at Rugby and Cambridge--and was evidently\nastonished, though she had too much tact to show it, that he had chosen\nto make his life and career in France instead of accepting the\nproposition made to him by his cousin Waddington, then Dean of Durham,\nto remain in England and continue his classic and literary studies under\nhis guidance. When the interview was over he found the Queen's faithful\nScotch retainer, John Brown, who always accompanied her everywhere,\nwaiting outside the door, evidently hoping to see the minister. He spoke\na few words with him, as a countryman--W. being half Scotch--his mother\nwas born Chisholm. They shook hands and John Brown begged him to come to\nScotland, where he would receive a hearty welcome. W. was very pleased\nwith his reception by the Queen. Lord Lyons told him afterward that she\nhad been very anxious to see him; she told him later, in speaking of the\ninterview, that it was very difficult to realise that she was speaking\nto a French minister--everything about him was so absolutely English,\nfigure, colouring, and speech.\n\nMany old school and college experiences were evoked that year by the\nvarious English who passed through Paris. One night at a big dinner at\nthe British Embassy I was sitting next to the Prince of Wales (late King\nEdward). He said to me: \"There is an old friend of your husband's here\nto-night, who will be so glad to see him again. They haven't met since\nhe was his fag at Rugby.\" After dinner he was introduced to me--Admiral\nGlynn--a charming man, said his last recollection of W. was making his\ntoast for him and getting a good cuff when the toast fell into the fire\nand got burnt. The two men talked together for some time in the\nsmoking-room, recalling all sorts of schoolboy exploits. Another school\nfriend was Sir Francis Adams, first secretary and \"counsellor\" at the\nBritish Embassy. When the ambassador took his holiday, Adams replaced\nhim, and had the rank and title of minister plenipotentiary. He came\nevery Wednesday, the diplomatic reception day, to the Quai d'Orsay to\ntalk business. As long as a secretary or a huissier was in the room,\nthey spoke to each other most correctly in French; as soon as they were\nalone, relapsed into easy and colloquial English. We were very fond of\nAdams--saw a great deal of him not only in Paris, but when we first\nlived in London at the embassy. He died suddenly in Switzerland, and W.\nmissed him very much. He was very intelligent, a keen observer, had\nbeen all over the world, and his knowledge and appreciation of foreign\ncountries and ways was often very useful to W.\n\nWe continued our dinners and receptions, which always interested me, we\nsaw so many people of all kinds. One dinner was for Prince Alexander of\nBattenberg, just as he was starting to take possession of the new\nprincipality of Bulgaria. He was one of the handsomest men I have ever\nseen,--tall, young, strong. He seemed the type of the dashing young\nchief who would inspire confidence in a new independent state. He didn't\nspeak of his future with much enthusiasm. I wonder if a presentiment was\neven then overclouding what seemed a brilliant beginning! He talked a\ngreat deal at dinner. He was just back from Rome, and full of its charm,\nwhich at once made a bond of sympathy between us. Report said he had\nleft his heart there with a young Roman. He certainly spoke of the happy\ndays with a shade of melancholy. I suggested that he ought to marry,\nthat would make his \"exile,\" as he called it, easier to bear. \"Ah, yes,\nif one could choose.\" Then after a pause, with an almost boyish\npetulance: \"They want me to marry Princess X., but I don't want to.\" \"Is\nshe pretty, will she help you in your new country?\" \"I don't know; I\ndon't care; I have never seen her.\"\n\nPoor fellow, he had a wretched experience. Some of the \"exiles\" were\nless interesting. A lady asked to see me one day, to enlist my\nsympathies for her brother and plead his cause with the minister. He had\nbeen named to a post which he couldn't really accept. I rather demurred,\ntelling her messenger, one of the secretaries of the Foreign Office,\nthat it was quite useless, her asking me to interfere. W. was not very\nlikely to consult me in his choice of nominations--and in fact the small\nappointments, secretaries, were generally prepared in the Chancellerie\nand followed the usual routine of regular promotion. An ambassador, of\ncourse, was different, and was sometimes taken quite outside the\ncarriere. The lady persisted and appeared one morning--a pretty,\nwell-dressed femme du monde whom I had often met without making her\nacquaintance. She plunged at once into her subject--her brother's\ndelicate health, accustomed to all the comforts and what the books call\n\"higher civilisation\" of Europe, able to do good service in courts and\nsociety, as he knew everybody. It was a pity to send him to such an\nout-of-the-way place, with an awful climate,--any consul's clerk would\ndo as well. I supposed he had been named to Caracas, South America, or\nsome other remote and unhealthy part of the globe, but when she stopped\nfor a moment, I discovered that the young man was named to Washington. I\nwas really surprised, didn't know what to say at once, when the\nabsurdity of the thing struck me and I answered that Washington was far,\nperhaps across the ocean, but there were compensations--but she took up\nher argument again, such an impossible place, everything so primitive, I\nreally think she thought the youth was going to an Indian settlement,\nall squaws and wigwams and tomahawks. I declined any interference with\nthe minister's appointments, assuring her I had no influence whatever,\nand she took leave of me very icily. I heard the sequel afterward--the\nyoung man refused the post as quite unworthy of him. There were several\nothers ready and pleased to take it, and M. de X. was put en\ndisponibilite.\n\nWe saw too that year for the first time the Grand Duke Alexander of\nRussia (later Emperor Alexander III, whose coronation we went to at\nMoscow) and the Grande Duchesse Marie. Prince Orloff arranged the\ninterview, as he was very anxious that the Grand Duke should have some\ntalk with W. They were in Paris for three or four days, staying at the\nHotel Bristol, where they received us. He was a tall, handsome man,\nwith a blond beard and blue eyes, quite the Northern type. She recalled\nher sister (Queen Alexandra), not quite so tall, but with the same\ngracious manner and beautiful eyes. The Grand Duke talked a great deal,\nprincipally politics, to W. He expressed himself very doubtfully about\nthe stability of the Republic, and was evidently worried over the\npossibility of a general amnesty, \"a very dangerous measure which no\ngovernment should sanction.\" W. assured him there would be no general\namnesty, but he seemed sceptical, repeated several times: \"Soyez stable,\nsoyez ferme.\" The Grande Duchesse talked to me about Paris, the streets\nwere so gay, the shops so tempting, and all the people so smiling and\nhappy. I suppose the contrast struck her, coming from Russia where the\npeople look sad and listless. I was much impressed with their sad,\nrepressed look when we were in Russia for the coronation--one never\nheard people laugh or sing in the streets--and yet we were there at a\ntime of great national rejoicings, amusements of all kinds provided for\nthe people. Their national melodies, volklieder (songs of the people),\nhave always a strain of sadness running through them. Our conversation\nwas in French, which both spoke very well.\n\nThe winter months went by quickly enough with periodical alarms in the\npolitical world when some new measure was discussed which aroused\neverybody's passions and satisfied neither side. I made weekly visits to\nmy own house, which was never dismantled, as I always felt our stay at\nthe Quai d'Orsay would not last much longer. One of our colleagues,\nMadame Leon Say, an intelligent, charming woman, took matters more\nphilosophically than I did. Her husband had been in and out of office so\noften that she was quite indifferent to sudden changes of residence.\nThey too kept their house open and she said she had always a terrine de\ncrise ready in her larders.\n\nThe diplomatic appointments, the embassies particularly, were a\ndifficulty. Admiral Pothnau went to London. He was a very gallant\nofficer and had served with the English in the Crimea--had the order of\nthe Bath, and exactly that stand-off, pompous manner which suits English\npeople. General Chanzy went to St. Petersburg. It has been the tradition\nalmost always to send a soldier to Russia. There is so little\nintercourse between the Russian Emperor and any foreigner, even an\nambassador, that an ordinary diplomatist, no matter how intelligent or\nexperienced he might be, would have very few opportunities to talk to\nthe Emperor; whereas an officer, with the various reviews and\nmanoeuvres that are always going on in Russia, would surely approach him\nmore easily. I was so struck when we were in Russia with the immense\ndistance that separated the princes from the ordinary mortals. They seem\nlike demigods on a different plane (in Russia I mean; of course when\nthey come to Paris their godlike attributes disappear, unfortunately for\nthemselves).\n\nChanzy was very happy in Russia, where he was extremely well received.\nHe dined with us one night, when he was at home on leave, and was most\nenthusiastic about everything in Russia--their finances, their army--the\nwomen of all classes so intelligent, so patriotic. He was evidently\nquite sous le charme. When he had gone, M. Desprey, then Directeur de la\nPolitique, a very clever man, who had seen many ambassadors come and go\nfrom all the capitals of Europe, said:\n\n\"It is curious how all the ambassadors who go to Russia have that same\nimpression. I have never known it to fail. It is the Russian policy to\nbe delightful to the ambassadors--make life very easy for them--show\nthem all that is brilliant and interesting--open all doors (society,\netc.) and keep all sordid and ugly questions in the background.\"\n\nSt. Vallier remained at Berlin. His name had been mentioned for Foreign\nMinister when Dufaure was making his cabinet, but he hadn't the health\nfor it--and I think preferred being in Berlin. He knew Germany well and\nhad a good many friends in Berlin.\n\nW. of course had a great many men's dinners, from which I was excluded.\nI dined often with some of my friends, not of the official world, and I\nused to ask myself sometimes if the Quai d'Orsay and these houses could\nbe in the same country. It was an entirely different world, every point\nof view different, not only politics--that one would expect, as the\nwhole of society was anti-Republican, Royalist, or Bonapartist--but\nevery question discussed wore a different aspect. Once or twice there\nwas a question of Louis XIV and what he would have done in certain\ncases,--the religious question always a passionate one. That of course I\nnever discussed, being a Protestant, and knowing quite well that the\nreal fervent Catholics think Protestants have no religion.\n\nI was out driving with a friend one morning in Lent (Holy Week),\nThursday I think--and said I could not be out late, as I must go to\nchurch--perhaps she would drop me at the Protestant Chapel in the Avenue\nde la Grand Armee. She was so absolutely astonished that it was almost\nfunny, though I was half angry too. \"You are going to church on Holy\nThursday. I didn't know Protestants ever kept Lent, or Holy Week or any\nsaint's day.\" \"Don't you think we ever go to church?\" \"Oh, yes, to a\nconference or sermon on Sundays, but you are not pratiquant like us.\" I\nwas really put out, and tried another day, when she was sitting with me,\nto show her our prayerbook, and explained that the Creed and the Lord's\nPrayer, to say nothing of various other prayers, were just the same as\nin her livre de Messe, but I didn't make any impression upon her--her\nonly remark being, \"I suppose you do believe in God,\"--yet she was a\nclever, well-educated woman--knew her French history well, and must have\nknown what a part the French Protestants played at one time in France,\nwhen many of the great nobles were Protestants.\n\nYears afterward, with the same friend, we were discussing the proposed\nmarriage of the Duke of Clarence, eldest son of the late King Edward VII\nof England, who wanted very much to marry Princess Helene d'Orleans,\ndaughter of the Comte de Paris, now Duchesse d'Aosta. It was impossible\nfor the English prince, heir to the throne, to marry a Catholic\nprincess--it seemed equally impossible for the French princess to become\na Protestant. The Pope was consulted and very strong influence brought\nto bear on the question, but the Catholic Church was firm. We were in\nLondon at the time, and of course heard the question much discussed. It\nwas an interesting case, as the two young people were much in love with\neach other. I said to my friend:\n\n\"If I were in the place of the Princess Helene I should make myself a\nProtestant. It is a big bait for the daughter of an exiled prince to be\nQueen of England.\"\n\n\"But it couldn't be; no Catholic could change her religion or make\nherself Protestant.\"\n\n\"Yet there is a precedent in your history. Your King Henri IV of beloved\nmemory, a Protestant, didn't hesitate to make himself a Catholic to be\nKing of France.\"\n\n\"Ah, but that is quite different.\"\n\n\"For you perhaps, chere amie, but not for us.\"\n\nHowever, the poor young prince died suddenly of pneumonia, so the\nsacrifice would have been in vain.\n\nAll the autumn of '79 was very agitated. We were obliged to curtail our\nstay at Bourneville, our country home. Even though the Chambers were not\nsitting, every description of political intrigue was going on. Every day\nW. had an immense courrier and every second day a secretary came down\nfrom the Quai d'Orsay with despatches and papers to sign. Telegrams came\nall day long. W. had one or two shooting breakfasts and the long tramps\nin the woods rested him. The guests were generally the notabilities of\nthe small towns and villages of his circumscription,--mayors, farmers,\nand small landowners. They all talked politics and W. was surprised to\nsee how in this quiet agricultural district the fever of democracy had\nmounted. Usually the well-to-do farmer is very conservative, looks\naskance at the very advanced opinions of the young radicals, but a\ncomplete change had come over them. They seemed to think the Republic,\nfounded at last upon a solid basis, supported by honest Republicans,\nwould bring untold prosperity not only to the country, but to each\nindividual, and many very modest, unpretending citizens of the small\ntowns saw themselves conseilleurs generaux, deputies, perhaps even\nministers. It was a curious change. However, on the whole, the people in\nour part of the world were reasonable. I was sorry to go back to town. I\nliked the last beautiful days of September in the country. The trees\nwere just beginning to turn, and the rides in the woods were delightful,\nthe roads so soft and springy. The horses seemed to like the brisk\ncanter as much as we did. We disturbed all the forest life as we\ngalloped along--hares and rabbits scuttled away--we saw their white\ntails disappearing into holes, and when we crossed a bit of plain,\npartridges a long distance off would rise and take their crooked flight\nacross the fields. It was so still, always is in the woods, that the\nhorses' feet could be heard a long way off. It was getting colder (all\nthe country folk predicted a very cold winter) and the wood-fire looked\nvery cheerful and comfortable in my little salon when we came in.\n\nHowever, everything must end, and W. had to go back to the fight, which\npromised to be lively. In Paris we found people wearing furs and\npreparing for a cold winter. The house of the Quai d'Orsay was\ncomfortable, well warmed, caloriferes and big fires in all the rooms,\nand whenever there was any sun it poured into the rooms from the garden.\nI didn't take up my official afternoon receptions. The session had not\nbegun, and, as it seemed extremely unlikely that the coming year would\nsee us still at the Quai d'Orsay, it was not worth while to embark upon\nthat dreary function. I was at home every afternoon after five--had tea\nin my little blue salon, and always had two or three people to keep me\ncompany. Prince Hohenlohe came often, settled himself in an armchair\nwith his cup of tea, and talked easily and charmingly about everything.\nHe was just back from Germany and reported Bismarck and the Emperor (I\nshould have said, perhaps, the Emperor and Bismarck) as rather worried\nover the rapid strides France was making in radicalism. He reassured\nthem, told them Grevy was essentially a man of peace, and, as long as\nmoderate men like W., Leon Say, and their friends remained in office,\nthings would go quietly. \"Yes, if they remain. I have an idea we shan't\nstay much longer, and report says Freycinet will be the next premier.\"\nHe evidently had heard the same report, and spoke warmly of\nFreycinet,--intelligent, energetic, and such a precise mind. If W. were\nobliged to resign, which he personally would regret, he thought\nFreycinet was the coming man--unless Gambetta wanted to be premier. He\ndidn't think he did, was not quite ready yet, but his hand might be\nforced by his friends, and of course if he wanted it, he would be the\nnext President du Conseil. He also told me a great many things that\nBlowitz had said to him--he had a great opinion of him--said he was so\nmarvellously well-informed of all that was going on. It was curious to\nsee how a keen, clever man like Prince Hohenlohe attached so much\nimportance to anything that Blowitz said. The nuncio, Monseigneur\nCzaski, came too sometimes at tea-time. He was a charming talker, but I\nalways felt as if he were saying exactly what he meant to and what he\nwanted me to repeat to W. I am never quite sure with Italians. There is\nalways a certain reticence under their extremely natural, rather\nexuberant manner. Monseigneur Czaski was not an Italian by birth--a\nPole, but I don't know that they inspire much more confidence.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nPARLIAMENT BACK IN PARIS\n\nThe question of the return of the Parliament to Paris had at last been\nsolved after endless discussions. All the Republicans were in favour of\nit, and they were masters of the situation. The President, Grevy, too\nwanted it very much. If the Chambers continued to sit at Versailles, he\nwould be obliged to establish himself there, which he didn't want to do.\nMany people were very unwilling to make the change, were honestly\nnervous about possible disturbances in the streets, and, though they\ngrumbled too at the loss of time, the draughty carriages of the\nparliamentary train, etc., they still preferred those discomforts to any\npossibility of rioting and street fights, and the invasion of the\nChamber of Deputies by a Paris mob. W. was very anxious for the change.\n\nHe didn't in the least anticipate any trouble--his principal reason for\nwanting the Parliament back was the loss of time, and also to get rid of\nthe conversations in the train, which tired him very much. He never\ncould make himself heard without an effort, as his voice was low, had no\n\"timbre,\" and he didn't hear his neighbours very well in the noise of\nthe train. He always arrived at the station at the last minute, and got\ninto the last carriage, hoping to be undisturbed, and have a quiet\nhalf-hour with his papers, but he was rarely left alone. If any deputy\nwho wanted anything recognised him, he of course got in the same\ncarriage, because he knew he was sure of a half-hour to state his case,\nas the minister couldn't get away from him. The Chambers met, after a\nshort vacation in November, at last in Paris, and already there were so\nmany interpellations announced on every possible subject, so many\ncriticisms on the policy of the cabinet, and so many people wanting\nother people's places, that the session promised to be very lively--the\nSenate at the Palais du Luxembourg, the Deputies at the Palais Bourbon.\n\nW. and I went over to the Luxembourg one morning early in October, to\nsee the arrangements that had been made for the Senate. He wanted too to\nchoose his seat. I hadn't been there in the daytime for years--I had\ndined once or twice at the Petit Palais with various presidents of the\nSenate, but my only impression was a very long drive (from the Barriere\nde l'Etoile where we lived) and fine high rooms with heavy gilt\nfurniture and tapestries. The palace was built by Maria de' Medici, wife\nof Henri IV. After the death of that very chivalrous but very undomestic\nmonarch, she retired to the Luxembourg, and from there as regent (her\nson Louis XIII was only ten years old when his father died) for some\nyears directed the policy of France under the guidance of her favourite,\nthe Italian Concini, and his wife.\n\nThe palace recalls very much the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, with its\nsolid masonry and rather severe heavy architecture. It must have been a\ngloomy residence, notwithstanding the beautiful gardens with their broad\nalleys and great open spaces. The gardens are stiff, very Italian, with\nstatues, fountains, and marble balustrades--not many flowers, except\nimmediately around the palace, but they were flooded with sunshine that\nday, and the old grey pile seemed to rise out of a parterre of bright\nflowers. The palace has been slightly modernised, but the general\narchitecture remains the same. Many people of all kinds have lived there\nsince it was built--several royal princes, and the Emperor Napoleon when\nhe was First Consul. He went from there to the Tuileries. The Luxembourg\nPalace has always been associated with the history of France. During\nthe Revolution it was a prison, and many of the curious scenes one reads\nof at that period took place in those old walls--the grandes dames so\ncareful of their dress and their manners, the grands seigneurs so brave\nand gallant, striving in every way by their witty conversation and their\nmusic (for they sang and played in the prisons all through that awful\ntime) to distract the women and make them forget the terrible doom that\nwas hanging over them. Many well-known people went straight from the\npalace to the scaffold. It seemed a fitting place for the sittings of\nthe Senate and the deliberations of a chosen body of men, who were\nsupposed to bring a maturer judgment and a wider experience in the\ndiscussion of all the burning questions of the day than the ardent young\ndeputies so eager to have done with everything connected with the old\nregime and start fresh.\n\nAfter we had inspected the palace we walked about the gardens, which\nwere charming that bright October morning,--the sun really too strong.\nWe found a bench in the shade, and sat there very happy, W. smoking and\nwondering what the next turn of the wheel would bring us. A great many\npeople were walking about and sitting under the trees. It was quite a\ndifferent public from what one saw anywhere else, many students of both\nsexes carrying books, small easels, and campstools,--some of the men\nsuch evident Bohemians, with long hair, sweeping moustache, and soft\nfelt hat,--quite the type one sees in the pictures or plays of \"La Vie\nde Boheme.\" Their girl companions looked very trim and neat, dressed\ngenerally in black, their clothes fitting extremely well--most of them\nbareheaded, but some had hats of the simplest description--none of the\nflaunting feathers and bright flowers one sees on the boulevards. They\nare a type apart, the modern grisettes, so quiet and well-behaved as to\nbe almost respectable. One always hears that the Quartier Latin doesn't\nexist any more--the students are more serious, less turbulent, and that\nthe hardworking little grisette, quite content with her simple life and\npleasure, has degenerated into the danseuse of the music-halls and\nbarriere theatres. I don't think so. A certain class of young,\nimpecunious students will always live in that quarter and will always\namuse themselves, and they will also always find girls quite ready and\nhappy to enjoy life a little while they are young enough to live in the\npresent, and have no cares for the future. Children were playing about\nin the alleys and broad, open spaces, and climbing on the fountains\nwhen the keepers of the garden were not anywhere near--their nurses\nsitting in a sunny corner with their work. It was quite another world,\nneither the Champs-Elysees nor Montmartre. All looked perfectly\nrespectable, and the couples sitting on out-of-the-way benches, in most\naffectionate attitudes, were too much taken up with each other to heed\nthe passer-by.\n\nI went back there several times afterward, taking Francis with me, and\nit was curious how out of the world one felt. Paris, our Paris, might\nhave been miles away. I learned to know some of the habitues quite\nwell--a white-haired old gentleman who always brought bread for the\nbirds; they knew him perfectly and would flutter down to the Square as\nsoon as he appeared--a handsome young man with a tragic face, always\nalone, walking up and down muttering and talking to himself--he may have\nbeen an aspirant for the Odeon or some of the theatres in the\nneighbourhood--a lame man on crutches, a child walking beside him\nlooking wistfully at the children playing about but not daring to leave\nher charge--groups of students hurrying through the gardens on their way\nto the Sorbonne, their black leather serviettes under their\narms--couples always everywhere. I don't think there were many\nforeigners or tourists,--I never heard anything but French spoken. Even\nthe most disreputable-looking old beggar at the gate who sold\nshoe-laces, learned to know us, and would run to open the door of\nthe carriage.\n\nWith the contrariety of human nature, some people would say of feminine\nnature, now that I felt I was not going to live much longer on the rive\ngauche I was getting quite fond of it. Life was so quiet and restful in\nthose long, narrow streets, some even with grass growing on the\npavement--no trams, no omnibuses, very little passing, glimpses\noccasionally of big houses standing well back from the street, a\ngood-sized courtyard in front and garden at the back--the classic\nFaubourg St. Germain hotel entre cour et jardin. I went to tea sometimes\nwith a friend who lived in a big, old-fashioned house in the rue de\nVarenne. She lived on the fourth floor--one went up a broad, bare, cold\nstone staircase (which always reminded me of some of the staircases in\nthe Roman palaces). Her rooms were large, very high ceilings, very\nlittle furniture in them, very little fire in winter, fine old family\nportraits on the walls, but from the windows one looked down on a lovely\ngarden where the sun shone and the birds sang all day. It was just like\nbeing in the country, so extraordinarily quiet. A very respectable man\nservant in an old-fashioned brown livery, with a great many brass\nbuttons, who looked as old as the house itself and as if he were part of\nit, always opened the door. Her husband was a literary man who made\nconferences at the Sorbonne and the College de France, and they lived\nentirely in that quarter--came very rarely to our part of Paris. He was\nan old friend of W.'s, and they came sometimes to dine with us. He\ndeplored W.'s having gone to the Foreign Office--thought the Public\nInstruction was so much more to his tastes and habits. She had an\nEnglish grandmother, knew English quite well, and read English reviews\nand papers. She had once seen Queen Victoria and was very interested in\nall that concerned her. Queen Victoria had a great prestige in France.\nPeople admired not only the wise sovereign who had weathered\nsuccessfully so many changes, but the beautiful woman's life as wife and\nmother. She was always spoken of with the greatest respect, even by\npeople who were not sympathetic to England as a nation.\n\nAnother of my haunts was the Convent and Maison de Sante of the Soeurs\nAugustines du Saint Coeur de Marie in the rue de la Sante. It was\ncurious to turn out of the broad, busy, populous avenue, crowded with\ntrams, omnibuses, and camions, into the narrow, quiet street, which\nseemed all stone walls and big doors. There was another hospital and a\nprison in the street, which naturally gave it rather a gloomy aspect,\nbut once inside the courtyard of the Convent there was a complete\ntransformation. One found one's self in a large, square, open court with\narcades and buildings all around--the chapel just opposite the entrance.\nOn one side of the court were the rooms for the patients, on the other\nnice rooms and small apartments which were let to invalids or old\nladies, and which opened on a garden, really a park of thirteen or\nfourteen acres. The doors were always open, and one had a lovely view of\ngreen fields and trees. The moment you put your foot inside the court,\nyou felt the atmosphere of peace and cheerfulness, though it was a\nhospital. The nuns all looked happy and smiling--they always do, and I\nalways wonder why. Life in a cloister seems to me so narrow and\nmonotonous and unsatisfying unless one has been bred in a convent and\nknows nothing of life but what the teachers tell.\n\nI have a friend who always fills me with astonishment--a very clever,\ncultivated woman, no longer very young, married to a charming man,\naccustomed to life in its largest sense. She was utterly wretched when\nher husband died, but after a time she took up her life again and\nseemed to find interest and pleasure in the things they had done\ntogether. Suddenly she announced her intention of becoming a nun--sold\nher house and lovely garden, where she had spent so many happy hours\nwith her flowers and her birds, distributed her pretty things among her\nfriends, and accepted all the small trials of strict convent life--no\nbath, nor mirror, coarse underlinen and sheets--no fire, no lights, no\nprivacy, the regular irksome routine of a nun's life, and is perfectly\nhappy--never misses the intellectual companionship and the refinement\nand daintiness of her former life,--likes the commonplace routine of the\nconvent--the books they read to each other in \"recreation,\" simple\nstories one would hardly give to a child of twelve or fourteen,--the\nfetes on the \"mother's\" birthday, when the nuns make a cake and put a\nwreath of roses on the mother's head.\n\nThe Soeurs Augustines are very happy in their lives, but they see a\ngreat deal more of the outside world. They always have patients in the\nhospital, and people in the apartments, which are much in demand. The\ncare and attendance is very good. The ladies are very comfortable and\nhave as many visitors as they like in the afternoon at stated hours, and\nthe rooms are very tempting with white walls and furniture, and\nscrupulously clean. The cuisine is very good, everything very daintily\nserved. All day one saw black-robed figures moving quietly across the\ncourt, carrying all kinds of invalid paraphernalia--cushions, rugs, cups\nof bouillon--but there was never any noise--no sound of talking or\nlaughing. When they spoke, the voices were low, like people accustomed\nto a sick-room. No men were allowed in the Convent, except the doctors\nof course, and visitors at stated hours.\n\nI spent many days there one spring, as C. was there for some weeks for a\nslight operation. She had a charming room and dressing-room, with\nwindows giving on a garden or rather farmyard, for the soeurs had their\ncows and chickens. Sometimes in the evening we would see one of the\nsisters, her black skirt tucked up and a blue apron over it, bringing\nthe cows back to their stables. No man could have a room in the house.\nF. wanted very much to be with his wife at night, as he was a busy man\nand away all day, and I tried to get a room for him, but the mother\nsuperior, a delightful old lady, wouldn't hear of it. However, the night\nbefore-and the night after the operation, he was allowed to remain with\nher,--no extra bed was put in the room--he slept on the sofa.\n\nOften when C. was sleeping or tired, I would take my book and establish\nmyself in the garden. Paris might have been miles away, though only a\nfew yards off there was a busy, crowded boulevard, but no noise seemed\nto penetrate the thick walls. Occasionally at the end of a quiet path I\nwould see a black figure pacing backward and forward, with eyes fixed on\na breviary. Once or twice a soeur jardiniere with a big, flat straw hat\nover her coiffe and veil tending the flowers (there were not many) or\nweeding the lawn, sometimes convalescents or old ladies seated in\narmchairs under the trees, but there was never any sound of voices or of\nlife. It was very reposeful (when one felt one could get away for a\nlittle while), but I think the absolute calm and monotony would pall\nupon one, and the \"Call of the World\"--the struggling, living, joyous\nworld outside the walls--would be an irresistible temptation.\n\nI walked about a good deal in my quarter in the morning, and made\nacquaintance with many funny little old squares and shops, merceries,\nflower and toy shops which had not yet been swallowed up by the enormous\nestablishments like the Louvre, the Bon Marche, and the big bazaars. I\ndon't know how they existed; there was never any one in the shops, and\nof course their choice was limited, but they were so grateful, their\nthings were so much cheaper, and they were so anxious to get anything\none wanted, that it was a pleasure to deal with them. Everything was\nmuch cheaper on that side--flowers, cakes, writing-paper, rents,\nservants' wages, stable equipment, horses' food. We bought some toys one\nyear for one of our Christmas trees in the country from a poor old lame\nwoman who had a tiny shop in one of the small streets running out of the\nrue du Bac. Her grandson, a boy of about twelve or fourteen, helped her\nin the shop, and they were so pleased and excited at having such a large\norder that they were quite bewildered. We did get what we wanted, but it\ntook time and patience,--their stock was small and not varied. We had to\nchoose piece by piece--horses, dolls, drums, etc.--and the writing down\nof the items and making up the additions was long and trying. I meant to\ngo back after we left the Quai d'Orsay, but I never did, and I am afraid\nthe poor old woman with her petit commerce shared the fate of all the\nothers and could not hold out against the big shops.\n\nOne gets lazy about shopping. The first years we lived in the country we\nused to go ourselves to the big shops and bazaars in Paris for our\nChristmas shopping, but the heat and the crowd and the waiting were so\ntiring that we finally made arrangements with the woman who sold toys in\nthe little town, La Ferte-Milon. She went to Paris and brought back\nspecimens of all the new toys. We went into town one afternoon--all the\ntoys were spread out on tables in her little parlour at the back of the\nshop (her little girl attending to the customers, who were consumed with\ncuriosity as to why our carriage was waiting so long at the door) and we\nmade our selection. She was a great help to us, as she knew all the\nchildren, their ages, and what they would like. She was very pleased to\nexecute the commission--it made her of importance in the town, having\nthe big boxes come down from Paris addressed to her, and she paid her\njourney and made a very good profit by charging two or three sous more\non each article. We were quite willing to pay the few extra francs to be\nsaved the fatigue of the long day's shopping in Paris. It also settled\nanother difficult question--what to buy in a small country town. Once we\nhad exhausted the butcher and the baker and the small groceries, there\nwas not much to buy.\n\nFrom the beginning of my life in the country, W. always wanted me to buy\nas much as possible in the town, and I was often puzzled. Now the shops\nin all the small country towns have improved. They have their things\nstraight from Paris, with very good catalogues, so that one can order\nfairly well. The things are more expensive of course, but I think it is\nright to give what help one can to the people of the country. One cold\nwinter at Bourneville, when we had our house full of people, there was a\nsudden call for blankets. I thought my \"lingerie\" was pretty well\nstocked, but one gentleman wanted four blankets on his bed, three over\nhim and one under the sheet. A couple wanted the same, only one more, a\nblanket for a big armchair near the fire. I went in to La Ferte to see\nwhat I could find--no white blankets anywhere--some rather nice red\nones--and plenty of the stiff (not at all warm) grey blankets they give\nto the soldiers. Those naturally were out of the question, but I took\nthree or four red ones, which of course could not go in the guests'\nrooms, but were distributed on the beds of the family, their white ones\ngoing to the friends. After that experience I always had a reserve of\nblankets, but I was never asked for so many again. Living in the\ncountry, with people constantly staying in the house, gives one much\ninsight into other people's way of living and what are the necessities\nof life for them. I thought our house was pretty well provided for. We\nwere a large family party, and had all we wanted, but some of the\ndemands were curious, varying of course with the nationalities.\n\nThe Chambers met in Paris at the end of November and took possession of\ntheir respective houses without the slightest disturbance of any kind.\nUp to the last moment some people were nervous and predicting all sorts\nof trouble and complications. We spent the Toussaint in the country with\nsome friends, and their views of the future were so gloomy that it was\nalmost contagious. One afternoon when we were all assembled in the\ndrawing-room for tea, after a beautiful day's shooting, the conversation\n(generally retrospective) was so melancholy that I was rather impressed\nby it,--\"The beginning of the end,--the culpable weakness of the\nGovernment and Moderate men, giving way entirely to the Radicals, an\ninvitation to the Paris rabble to interfere with the sittings of the\nChambers,\" and a variety of similar remarks.\n\nIt would have been funny if one hadn't felt that the speakers were\nreally in earnest and anxious. However, nothing happened. The first few\ndays there was a small, perfectly quiet, well-behaved crowd, also a very\nstrong police force, at the Palais Bourbon, but I think more from\ncuriosity and the novelty of seeing deputies again at the Palais Bourbon\nthan from any other reason. If it were quiet outside, one couldn't say\nthe same of the inside of the Chamber. The fight began hotly at once.\nSpeeches and interpellations and attacks on the Government were the\norder of the day. The different members of the cabinet made statements\nexplaining their policy, but apparently they had satisfied nobody on\neither side, and it was evident that the Chamber was not only\ndissatisfied but actively hostile.\n\nW. and his friends were very discouraged and disgusted. They had gone as\nfar as they could in the way of concessions. W., at any rate, would do\nno more, and it was evident that the Chamber would seize the first\npretext to overthrow the ministry. W. saw Grevy very often. He was\nopposed to any change, didn't want W. to go, said his presence at the\nForeign Office gave confidence to Europe,--he might perhaps remain at\nthe Foreign Office and resign as Premier, but that, naturally, he\nwouldn't do. He was really sick of the whole thing.\n\nGrevy was a thorough Republican but an old-fashioned Republican,--not in\nthe least enthusiastic, rather sceptical--didn't at all see the ideal\nRepublic dreamed of by the younger men--where all men were alike--and\nnothing but honesty and true patriotism were the ruling motives. I\ndon't know if he went as far as a well-known diplomatist, Prince\nMetternich, I think, who said he was so tired of the word fraternite\nthat if he had a brother he would call him \"cousin.\" Grevy was certainly\nvery unwilling to see things pass into the hands of the more advanced\nLeft. I don't think he could have done anything--they say no\nconstitutional President (or King either) can.\n\nThere was a great rivalry between him and Gambetta. Both men had such a\nstrong position in the Republican party that it was a pity they couldn't\nunderstand each other. I suppose they were too unlike--Gambetta lived in\nan atmosphere of flattery and adulation. His head might well have been\nturned--all his familiars were at his feet, hanging upon his words,\nputting him on a pinnacle as a splendid patriot. Grevy's entourage was\nmuch calmer, recognising his great ability and his keen legal mind, not\nso enthusiastic but always wanting to have his opinion, and relying a\ngood deal upon his judgment. There were of course all sorts of meetings\nand conversations at our house, with Leon Say, Jules Ferry, Casimir\nPerier, and others. St. Vallier came on from Berlin, where he was still\nambassador. He was very anxious about the state of affairs in\nFrance--said Bismarck was very worried at the great step the Radicals\nhad made in the new Parliament--was afraid the Moderate men would have\nno show. _I_ believe he was pleased and hoped that a succession of\nincapable ministries and internal quarrels would weaken France still\nmore--and prevent her from taking her place again as a great power. He\nwasn't a generous victor.\n\nAs long as W. was at the Foreign Office things went very smoothly. He\nand St. Vallier thought alike on most subjects, home politics and\nforeign--and since the Berlin Congress, where W. had come in touch with\nall the principal men in Germany, it was of course much easier for them\nto work together. We dined generally with my mother on Sunday\nnight--particularly at this time of the year, when the official banquets\nhad not begun and our Sundays were free. The evenings were always\ninteresting, as we saw so many people, English and Americans always, and\nin fact all nationalities. We had lived abroad so much that we knew\npeople all over the world,--it was a change from the eternal politics\nand \"shop\" talk we heard everywhere else. Some of them, English\nparticularly (I don't think the Americans cared much about foreign\npolitics), were most interested and curious over what was going on, and\nthe probable fall of the cabinet. An English lady said to me: \"How\ndreadful it will be for you when your husband is no longer minister;\nyour life will be so dull and you will be of so much less importance.\"\nThe last part of the sentence was undoubtedly true--any functionary's\nwife has a certain importance in France, and when your husband has been\nForeign Minister and Premier, you fall from a certain height, but I\ncouldn't accept the first part, that my life would be necessarily dull\nbecause I was no longer what one of my friends said in Italy, speaking\nof a minister's wife, a donna publica. I began to explain that I really\nhad some interest in life outside of politics, but she was so convinced\nof the truth of her observation that it was quite useless to pursue the\nconversation, and I naturally didn't care. Another one, an American this\ntime, said to me: \"I hope you don't mind my never having been to see you\nsince you were married, but I never could remember your name; I only\nknew it began with W. and one sees it very often in the papers.\"\n\nArthur Sullivan, the English composer, was there one night. He had come\nover to Paris to hear one of his symphonies played at the Conservatoire,\nand was very much pleased with the way it had been received by that very\ncritical audience. He was quite surprised to find the Parisians so\nenthusiastic--had always heard the Paris Salle was so cold.\n\nMiss Kellogg, the American prima donna, was there too that evening, and\nwe made a great deal of music, she singing and Sullivan accompanying by\nheart. Mrs. Freeman, wife of one of the English secretaries, told W.\nthat Queen Victoria had so enjoyed her talk with him--\"quite as if I\nwere talking with one of my own ministers.\" She had found Grevy rather\nstiff and reserved--said their conversation was absolutely banal. They\nspoke in French, and as Grevy knew nothing of England or the English,\nthe interview couldn't have been interesting.\n\nWe saw a great many people that last month, dined with all our\ncolleagues of the diplomatic corps. They were already diners d'adieux,\nas every day in the papers the fall of the ministry was announced, and\nthe names of the new ministers published. I think the diplomatists were\nsorry to see W. go, but of course they couldn't feel very strongly on\nthe subject. Their business is to be on good terms with all the foreign\nministers, and to get as much as they can out of them. They are, with\nrare exceptions, birds of passage, and don't trouble themselves much\nabout changing cabinets. However, they were all very civil, not too\ndiffuse, and one had the impression that they would be just as civil to\nour successor and to his successor. It must be so; there is no\nprofession so absolutely banal as diplomacy. All diplomatists, from the\nambassador to the youngest secretary, must follow their instructions,\nand if by any chance an ambassador does take any initiative, profiting\nby being on the spot, and knowing the character of the people, he is\npromptly disowned by his chief.\n\nI had grown very philosophical, was quite ready to go or to stay, didn't\nmind the fight any more nor the attacks on W., which were not very\nvicious, but so absurd that no one who knew him could attach the least\nimportance to them. He didn't care a pin. He had always been a\nProtestant, with an English name, educated in England, so the\nreiteration of these facts, very much exaggerated and leading up to the\nconclusion that on account of his birth and education he couldn't be a\nconvinced French Republican, didn't affect him very much. He had always\npromised me a winter in Italy when he left office. He had never been in\nRome, and I was delighted at the prospect of seeing that lovely land\nagain, all blue sky and bright sun and smiling faces.\n\nWe dined often with M.L., W.'s uncle, who kept us au courant of all (and\nit was little) that was going on in the Royalist camp, but that was not\nof importance. The advanced Republicans were having it all their own\nway, and it was evident that the days of conciliatory measures and\nmoderate men were over. W. was not a club man, went very rarely to his\nclub, but his uncle went every afternoon before dinner, and gave us all\nthe potins (gossip) of that world, very hostile to the Republic, and\nstill quite believing that their turn would come. His uncle was not of\nthat opinion. He was a very clever man, a diplomatist who had lived in a\ngreat many places and known a great many people, and was entirely on the\nRoyalist side, but he thought their cause was a lost one, at least for a\ntime. He often asked some of his friends to meet us at dinner, said it\nwas a good thing for W. to hear what men on the other side thought, and\nW. was quite pleased to meet them. They were all absolutely opposed to\nhim in politics, and discussion sometimes ran high, but there was never\nanything personal--all were men of the world, had seen many changes in\nFrance in their lives; many had played a part in politics under the\nformer regimes. It seemed to me that they underrated the intelligence\nand the strength of the Republican party.\n\nOne of the regular habitues was the Marquis de N., a charming man,\nfairly broad-minded (given the atmosphere he lived in) and sceptical to\nthe highest degree. He was a great friend of Marshal MacMahon, and had\nbeen prefet at Pau, where he had a great position. He was very\ndictatorial, very outspoken, but was a great favourite, particularly\nwith the English colony, which is large there in the hunting-season. He\nhad accepted to dine one night with an English family, who lived in a\nvilla a little out of town. They had an accident en route, which delayed\nthem very much, and when he and the marquise arrived the party was at\ntable. He instantly had his carriage called back and left the house in\nspite of all the explanations and apologies of his host, saying that\nwhen \"one had the honour of receiving the Marquis de N. one waited\ndinner for him.\"\n\nWe saw always a great deal of him, as his daughter married the Comte de\nF., who was for some time in W.'s cabinet at the Quai d'Orsay, and\nafterward with us the ten years we were at the London Embassy, where\nthey were quite part of the family. They were both perfectly fitted for\ndiplomatic life, particularly in England. Both spoke English well, knew\neverybody, and remembered all the faces and all the names, no easy thing\nin England, where the names and titles change so often. I know several\nEnglishwomen who have had four different names. Lady Holland was also a\nfriend of \"Oncle Alphonse\" and dined there often. She was\ndelicate-looking, rather quiet in general conversation, though she spoke\nFrench easily, but was interesting when she was talking to one or two\npeople. We went often to her beautiful house in London, the first years\nwe were at the embassy, and always met interesting people. Her salon was\nvery cosmopolitan--every one who came to London wanted to go to Holland\nHouse, which was a museum filled with beautiful things.\n\nAnother lady who was often at my uncle's was quite a different type,\nMademoiselle A., an old pupil of the Conservatoire, who had made a short\ncareer at the Comedie Francaise many years before. She was really\ncharming, and her stories of the coulisses and the jalousies between the\nauthors and the actors, particularly the stars (who hardly accepted the\nslightest observation from the writer of the play), were most amusing.\nOnce the piece was accepted it passed into the domain of the theatre,\nand the actors felt at liberty to interpret the roles according to their\nideas and traditions. She had a perfect diction; it was a delight to\nhear her. She recited one night one of Alphonse Daudet's little contes,\n\"Lettres de Mon Moulin,\" I think, beginning--\"Qui n'a pas vu Avignon du\ntemps des Papes n'a rien vu.\" One couldn't hear anything more charming,\nin a perfectly trained voice, and so easily and naturally said.\n\nI suppose no one would listen to it in these days. Bridge has suppressed\nall conversation or music or artistic enjoyment of any kind. It must\ncome to an end some day like all crazes, but at the present moment it\nhas destroyed society. It has been a godsend to many people of no\nparticular importance or position who have used it as a stepping-stone\nto get into society. If people play a good game of bridge, they are\nwelcome guests in a great many houses which formerly would have been\nclosed to them, and it is a great resource to ladies no longer very\nyoung, widows and spinsters, who find their days long and don't know\nwhat to do with their lives.\n\nNotwithstanding his preoccupations, W. managed to get a few days'\nshooting in November. He shot several times at Rambouillet with Grevy,\nwho was an excellent shot, and his shooting breakfasts were very\npleasant. There was plenty of game, everything very well organised, and\nthe company agreeable. He always asked the ministers, ambassadors, and\nmany of the leading political men and very often some of his old\nfriends, lawyers and men of various professions whom W. was delighted\nto meet. Their ideas didn't run in grooves like most of the men he lived\nwith, and it was a pleasure to hear talk that wasn't political nor\npersonal. The vicious attacks upon persons were so trying those first\ndays of the Republic. Every man who was a little more prominent than his\nneighbour seemed a target for every kind of insinuation and criticism.\n\nWe went for two days to \"Pout,\" Casimir Perier's fine place in the\ndepartement de l'Aube, where we had capital shooting. It was already\nextremely cold for the season--the big pond in the court was frozen\nhard, and the wind whistled about our ears when we drove in an open\ncarriage to join the shooters at breakfast. Even I, who don't usually\nfeel the cold, was thankful to be well wrapped up in furs. The Pavillon\nd'Hiver looked very inviting as we drove up--an immense fire was blazing\nin the chimney, another just outside, where the soup and ragout for the\narmy of beaters were being prepared. We all had nice little foot-warmers\nunder our chairs, and were as comfortable as possible. It was too warm\nin fact when the shooters came in and we sat down to breakfast. We were\nobliged to open the door. The talk was entirely \"shop\" at breakfast,\nevery man telling what he had killed, or missed, and the minute they\nhad finished breakfast, they started off again. We followed one or two\nbattues (pheasants), but it was really too cold, and we were glad to\nwalk home to get warm.\n\nThe dinner and evening were pleasant--everybody talking--most of them\ncriticising the Government freely. W. didn't mind, they were all\nfriends. He defended himself sometimes, merely asking what they would\nhave done in his place--he was quite ready to receive any\nsuggestions--but nothing practical ever came out of the discussions. I\nthink the most delightful political position in the world must be\n\"leader of the opposition\"--you have no responsibilities, can\nconcentrate all your energies in pointing out the weak spots in your\nadversary's armour, and have always your work cut out for you, for as\nsoon as one ministry falls, you can set to work to demolish its\nsuccessor, which seems the most interesting occupation possible.\n\nThe great question which was disturbing the Chambers and the country was\nthe general amnesty. That, of course, W. would never agree to. There\nmight be exceptions. Some of the men who took part in the Commune were\nso young, little more than lads, carried away by the example of their\nelders and the excitement of the moment, and there were fiery patriotic\narticles in almost all the Republican papers inviting France to make the\nbeau geste of la mere patrie and open her arms to her misguided\nchildren, and various sensible experienced men really thought it would\nbe better to wipe out everything and start again with no dark memories\nto cast a shadow on the beginnings of the young Republic. How many\nbrilliant, sanguine, impossible theories I heard advanced all those\ndays, and how the few remaining members of the Centre Gauche tried to\nreason with the most liberal men of the Centre Droit and to persuade\nthem frankly to face the fact that the country had sent a strong\nRepublican majority to Parliament and to make the best of the fait\naccompli. I suppose it was asking too much of them to go back on the\ntraditions of their lives, but after all they were Frenchmen, their\ncountry was just recovering from a terrible disaster, and had need of\nall her children. During the Franco-Prussian War all party feeling was\nforgotten. Every man was first a Frenchman in the face of a foreign foe,\nand if they could have stood firmly together in those first days after\nthe war the strength of the country would have been wonderful. All\nEurope was astounded at the way in which France paid her milliards,--no\none more so than Bismarck, who is supposed to have said that, if he\ncould have dreamed that France could pay that enormous sum so quickly,\nhe would have asked much more.\n\nDecember was very cold, snow and ice everywhere, and very hard frosts,\nwhich didn't give way at all when the sun came out occasionally in the\nmiddle of the day. Everybody was skating, not only at the clubs of the\nBois de Boulogne, but on the lakes, which happens very rarely, as the\nwater is fairly deep. The Seine was full of large blocks of ice, which\ngot jammed up against the bridges and made a jarring ugly sound as they\nknocked against each other. The river steamers had stopped running, and\nthere were crowds of flaneurs loitering on the quais and bridges\nwondering if the cold would last long enough for the river to be quite\nfrozen over.\n\nW. and I went two or three times to the Cercle des Patineurs at the Bois\nde Boulogne, and had a good skate. The women didn't skate as well then\nas they do now, but they looked very pretty in their costumes of velvet\nand sables. It was funny to see them stumbling over the ice with a man\nsupporting them on each side. However, they enjoyed it very much. It was\nbeautiful winter weather, very cold but no wind, and it was very good\nexercise. All the world was there, and the afternoons passed quickly\nenough. I had not skated for years, having spent all my winters in\nItaly, but on the principle that you never forget anything that you know\nwell, I thought I would try, and will say that the first half-hour was\nabsolute suffering. It was in the old days when one still wore a strap\nover the instep, which naturally was drawn very tight. My feet were like\nlumps of ice, as heavy as lead, and I didn't seem able to lift them from\nthe ground. I went back to the dressing-room to take my skates off for a\nfew minutes, and when the blood began to circulate again, I could have\ncried with the pain. A friend of mine, a beginner, who was sitting near\nwaiting to have her skates put on, was rather discouraged, and said to\nme: \"You don't look as if you were enjoying yourself. I don't think I\nwill try.\" \"Oh yes you must,--'les commencements sont toujours\ndifficiles,' and you will learn. I shall be all right as soon as I start\nagain.\" She looked rather doubtful, but I saw her again later in the\nday, when I had forgotten all about my sufferings, and she was skating\nas easily as I did when I was a girl. I think one must learn young.\nAfter all, it is more or less a question of balance. When one is young\none doesn't mind a fall.\n\nW., who had retired to a corner to practise a little by himself, told me\nthat one of his friends, Comte de Pourtales, not at all of his way of\nthinking in politics, an Imperialist, was much pleased with a little jeu\nd'esprit he had made at his expense. W. caught the top of his skate in a\ncrevice in the ice, and came down rather heavily in a sitting posture.\nComte de Pourtales, who was standing near on the bank, saw the fall and\ncalled out instantly, \"Est-ce possible que je voie le President du\nConseil par terre?\" (Is it possible that the President du Conseil has\nfallen?) The little joke was quite de bonne guerre and quite\nappropriate, as the cabinet was tottering and very near its fall. It\namused W. quite as much as it did the bystanders.\n\nThe cold was increasing every day, the ground was frozen hard, the\nstreets very slippery, and going very difficult. All our horses were\nrough shod, but even with that we made very slow progress. Some of the\nomnibuses were on runners, and one or two of the young men of the\nministry had taken off the wheels of their light carriages and put them\non runners, but one didn't see many real sleighs or sledges, as they\ncall them here. I fancy \"sleigh\" is entirely an American expression. The\nSeine was at last completely taken, and the public was allowed on the\nice, which was very thick. It was a very pretty, animated sight, many\nbooths like those one sees on the Boulevard during the Christmas\nholidays were installed on the ice close to the banks, and the river was\nblack with people. They couldn't skate much, as the ice was rough and\nthere were too many people, but they ran and slid and shouted and\nenjoyed themselves immensely. I wanted to cross one day with my boy,\nthat he might say he had crossed the Seine on foot, but W. was rather\nunwilling. However, the prefet de la Seine, whom he consulted, told him\nthere was absolutely no danger--the ice was several inches thick, so I\nstarted off one afternoon, one of the secretaries going with me. He was\nmuch astonished and rather nervous at seeing me in my ordinary boots. He\nhad nails in his, and one of our friends whom we met on the ice had\nwoollen socks over his boots. They were sure I would slip and perhaps\nget a bad fall. \"But no one could slip on that ice; it is quite rough,\nmight almost be a ploughed field,\"--but they were uncomfortable, and\nwere very pleased when I landed safely on the other side and got into\nthe carriage. Just in the middle the boys had swept a path on the ice to\nmake a glissade. They were racing up and down in bands, and the constant\npassing had made it quite level and very slippery. We saw three or four\nunwary pedestrians get a fall, but if one kept on the outside near the\nbank there was no danger of slipping.\n\nThe extreme cold lasting so long brought many discomforts. Many trains\nwith wood and provisions couldn't get to Paris. The railroads were all\nblocked and the Parisians were getting uneasy, fearing they might run\nshort of food and fuel. We were very comfortable in the big rooms of the\nministry. There were roaring fires everywhere, and two or three\ncaloriferes. The view from the windows on the Quai was charming as long\nas the great cold lasted, particularly at night, when the river was\nalive with people, lights and  lanterns, and music. Every now\nand then there would be a ronde or a farandole,--the farandole forcing\nits way through the crowd, every one carrying a lantern and looking like\na brilliant snake winding in and out.\n\nWe had some people dining one night, and they couldn't keep away from\nthe windows. Some of the young ones (English) wanted to go down and have\na lark on the ice, but it wasn't possible. The crowd, though thoroughly\ngood-humoured, merely bent on enjoying themselves, had degenerated into\na rabble. One would have been obliged to have a strong escort of police,\nand besides in evening dress, even with fur cloaks and the fur and\nwoollen boots every one wore over their thin shoes, one would certainly\nhave risked getting a bad attack of pneumonia. One of our great friends,\nSir Henry Hoare, was dining that night, but he didn't want to go down,\npreferred smoking his cigar in a warm room and talking politics to W. He\nhad been a great deal in Paris, knew everybody, and was a member of the\nJockey Club. He was much interested in French politics and au fond was\nvery liberal, quite sympathised with W. and his friends and shared their\nopinions on most subjects, though as he said, \"I don't air those\nopinions at the Jockey Club.\" He came often to our big receptions, liked\nto see all the people. He too used to tell me all that was said in his\nclub about the Republic and the Government, but he was a shrewd\nobserver, had been a long time an M.P. in England, and had come to the\nconclusion that the talk at the clubs was chiefly a \"pose,\"--they didn't\nreally have many illusions about the restoration of the monarchy,\ncouldn't have, when even the Duc de Broglie with his intelligence and\nfollowing (the Faubourg St. Germain followed him blindly) could do\nnothing but make a constitutional Republic with Marshal MacMahon at\nits head.\n\nIt was always said too that the women were more uncompromising than the\nmen. I went one afternoon to a concert at the Austrian Embassy, given in\naid of some inundations, which had been a catastrophe for that country,\nhundreds of houses, and people and cattle swept away! The French public\nhad responded most generously, as they always do, to the urgent appeal\nmade by the ambassador in the name of the Emperor, and the Government\nhad contributed largely to the fund. Count Beust the Austrian ambassador\nwas obliged of course to invite the Government and Madame Grevy to the\nentertainment, as well as his friends of the Faubourg St. Germain.\nNeither Madame nor Mademoiselle Grevy came, but some of the ministers'\nwives did, and it was funny to see the ladies of society looking at the\nRepublican ladies, as if they were denizens of a different planet,\nstrange figures they were not accustomed to see. It is curious to think\nof all that now, when relations are much less strained. I remember not\nvery long ago at a party at one of the embassies, seeing many of the\nsociety women having themselves presented to the wife of the then\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, with whom they certainly had nothing in\ncommon, neither birth, breeding, nor mode of life. I was talking to\nCasimir Perier (late President of the Republic) and it amused us very\nmuch to see the various introductions and the great empressement of the\nladies, all of whom were asking to be presented to Madame R. \"What can\nall those women want?\" I asked him. He replied promptly, \"Embassies for\ntheir husbands.\" It would have been better, I think, in a worldly point\nof view, if more embassies had been given to the bearers of some of the\ngreat names of France--but there were so many candidates for every\ndescription of function in France just then, from an ambassador to a\ngendarme, that anybody who had anything to give found himself in a\ndifficult position.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nLAST DAYS AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE\n\nThe end of December was detestable. We were en pleine crise for ten\ndays. Every day W. went to the Chamber of Deputies expecting to be\nbeaten, and every evening came home discouraged and disgusted. The\nChamber was making the position of the ministers perfectly\nuntenable--all sorts of violent and useless propositions were discussed,\nand there was an undercurrent of jealousy and intrigue everywhere. One\nday, just before Christmas, about the 20th, W. and his chef de cabinet,\nComte de P., started for the house, after breakfast--W. expecting to be\nbeaten by a coalition vote of the extreme Left, Bonapartists and\nLegitimists. It was an insane policy on the part of the two last, as\nthey knew perfectly well they wouldn't gain anything by upsetting the\nactual cabinet. They would only get another one much more advanced and\nmore masterful. I suppose their idea was to have a succession of radical\ninefficient ministers, which in the end would disgust the country and\nmake a \"saviour,\" a prince (which one?) or general, possible. How wise\ntheir reasoning was time has shown! I wanted to go to the Chamber to\nhear the debate, but W. didn't want me. He would be obliged to speak,\nand said it would worry him if I were in the gallery listening to all\nthe attacks made upon him. (It is rather curious that I never heard him\nspeak in public, either in the house or in the country, where he often\nmade political speeches, in election times.) He was so sure that the\nministry would fall that we had already begun cleaning and making fires\nin our own house, so on that afternoon, as I didn't want to sit at home\nwaiting for telegrams, I went up to the house with Henrietta. The\ncaretaker had already told us that the stock of wood and coal was giving\nout, and she couldn't get any more in the quarter, and if she couldn't\nmake fires the pipes would burst, which was a pleasant prospect with the\nthermometer at I don't remember how many degrees below zero. We found a\nfine cleaning going on--doors and windows open all over the house--and\nwomen scrubbing stairs, floors, and windows, rather under difficulties,\nwith little fire and little water. It looked perfectly dreary and\ncomfortless--not at all tempting. All the furniture was piled up in the\nmiddle of the rooms, and W.'s library was a curiosity. Books and\npamphlets accumulated rapidly with us, W. was a member of many literary\nsocieties of all kinds all over the world, and packages and boxes of\nunopened books quite choked up the room. H. and I tried to arrange\nthings a little, but it was hopeless that day, and, besides, the house\nwas bitterly cold. It didn't feel as if a fire could make any\nimpression.\n\nAs we could do nothing there, we went back to the ministry. No telegrams\nhad come, but Kruft, our faithful and efficient chef du materiel, was\nwaiting for me for last instructions about a Christmas tree. Some days\nbefore I had decided to have a Christmas tree, about the end of the\nmonth. W. then thought the ministry would last over the holidays, the\ntreve des confiseurs, and was quite willing I should have a Christmas\nparty as a last entertainment. He had been too occupied the last days to\nthink about any such trifles, and Kruft, not having had any contrary\ninstructions, had ordered the presents and decorations. He was rather\ndepressed, because W. had told him that morning that we surely would not\nbe at the Quai d'Orsay on the 29th, the day we had chosen for our party.\nHowever, I reassured him, and told him we would have the Christmas tree\nall the same, only at my house instead of at the ministry. We went to\nlook at his presents, which were all spread out on a big table in one of\nthe drawing-rooms. He really was a wonderful man, never forgot anything,\nand had remembered that at the last tree, the year before, one or two\nnurses had had no presents, and several who had were not pleased with\nwhat was given to them. He had made a very good selection for those\nladies,--lace scarfs and rabats and little tours de cou of fur,--really\nvery pretty. I believe they were satisfied this time. The young men of\nthe Chancery sent me up two telegrams: \"rien de nouveau,\"--\"ministere\ndebout.\"\n\n[Illustration: M. de Freyeinet. After a photograph by M. Nadaz, Paris]\n\nW. came home late, very tired and much disgusted with politics in\ngeneral and his party in particular. The cabinet still lived, but merely\nto give Grevy time to make another. W. had been to the Elysee and had a\nlong conversation with Grevy. He found him very preoccupied, very\nunwilling to make a change, and he again urged W. very much to keep the\nForeign Office, if Freycinet should succeed in making a ministry. That\nW. would not agree to--he was sick of the whole thing. He told Grevy he\nwas quite right to send for Freycinet--if any man could save the\nsituation he could. We had one or two friends, political men, to dinner,\nand they discussed the situation from every point of view, always\nending with the same conclusion, that W. was right to go. His policy\nwasn't the policy of the Chamber (I don't say of the country, for I\nthink the country knew little and cared less about what was going on in\nParliament), hardly the policy of all his own colleagues. There was\nreally no use to continue worrying himself to death and doing no good.\nW. said his conversation with Grevy was interesting, but he was much\nmore concerned with home politics and the sweeping changes the\nRepublicans wanted to make in all the administrations than with foreign\npolicy. He said Europe was quiet and France's first duty was to\nestablish herself firmly, which would only be done by peace and\nprosperity at home. I told W. I had spent a very cold and uncomfortable\nhour at the house, and I was worried about the cold, thought I might,\nperhaps, send the boy to mother, but he had taken his precautions and\narranged with the Minister of War to have a certain amount of wood\ndelivered at the house. They always had reserves of wood at the various\nministries. We had ours directly from our own woods in the country, and\nit was en route, but a flotilla of boats was frozen up in the Canal de\nl'Ourcq, and it might be weeks before the wood could be delivered.\n\nWe dined one night at the British Embassy, while all these pourparlers\nwere going on, en petit comite, all English, Lord and Lady Reay, Lord\nEdmond Fitz-Maurice, and one or two members of Parliament whose names I\nhave forgotten. Both Lord and Lady Reay were very keen about politics,\nknew France well, and were much interested in the phase she was passing\nthrough. Lord Lyons was charming, so friendly and sensible, said he\nwasn't surprised at W.'s wanting to go--still hoped this crisis would\npass like so many others he had seen in France; that certainly W.'s\npresence at the Foreign Office during the last year had been a help to\nthe Republic--said also he didn't believe his retirement would last very\nlong. It was frightfully cold when we came out of the embassy--very few\ncarriages out, all the coachmen wrapped up in mufflers and fur caps, and\nthe Place de la Concorde a sea of ice so slippery I thought we should\nnever get across and over the bridge. I went to the opera one night that\nweek, got there in an entr'acte, when people were walking about and\nreading the papers. As I passed several groups of men, I heard W.'s name\nmentioned, also that of Leon Say and Freycinet, but just in passing by\nquickly I could not hear any comments. I fancy they were not favourable\nin that milieu. It was very cold in the house--almost all the women had\ntheir cloaks on--and the coming out was something awful, crossing that\nbroad perron in the face of a biting wind.\n\nI began my packing seriously this time, as W.'s mind was quite made up.\nHe had thought the matter well over, and had a final talk with\nFreycinet, who would have liked to keep both W. and Leon Say, but it\nwasn't easy to manage the new element that Freycinet brought with him.\nThe new members were much more advanced in their opinions. W. couldn't\nhave worked with them, and they certainly didn't want to work with him.\nThe autumn session came to a turbulent end on the 26th of December, and\nthe next day the papers announced that the ministers had given their\nresignations to the President, who had accepted them and had charged M.\nde Freycinet to form a cabinet. We dined with mother on Christmas day, a\nfamily party, with the addition of Comte de P. and one or two stray\nAmericans who were at hotels and were of course delighted not to dine on\nChristmas day at a table d'hote or cafe. W. was rather tired; the\nconstant talking and seeing so many people of all kinds was very\nfatiguing, for, as long as his resignation was not official, announced\nin the _Journal Officiel_, he was still Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nOne of the last days, when they were hoping to come to an agreement, he\nwas obliged to come home early to receive the mission from Morocco. I\nsaw them arrive; they were a fine set of men, tall, powerfully built,\ntheir skin a red-brown, not black, entirely dressed in white from\nturbans to sandals. None of them spoke any French--all the conversation\ntook place through an interpreter. Notwithstanding our worries, we had a\nvery pleasant evening and W. was very cheerful--looking forward to our\nItalian trip with quite as much pleasure as I did.\n\nW. made over the ministry to Freycinet on Monday, the 28th, the\ntransmission des pouvoirs. Freycinet was very nice and friendly,\nregretted that he and W. were no longer colleagues. He thought his\nministry was strong and was confident he would manage the Chamber. W.\ntold him he could settle himself as soon as he liked at the Quai\nd'Orsay, as we should go at once, and would sleep at our house on\nWednesday night. Freycinet said Madame de Freycinet (whom I knew well\nand liked very much) would come and see me on Wednesday, and would like\nto go over the house with me. I was rather taken aback when W. told me\nwe must sleep in our own house on Wednesday night. The actual packing\nwas not very troublesome, as I had not brought many of my own things\nfrom the rue Dumont d'Urville. There was scarcely a van-load of small\nfurniture and boxes, but the getting together of all the small things\nwas a bore,--books, bibelots, music, cards, and notes (these in\nquantities, lettres de condoleance, which had to be carefully sorted as\nthey had all to be answered). The hotel of the Quai d'Orsay was crowded\nwith people those last two days, all W.'s friends coming to express\ntheir regrets at his departure, some very sincerely sorry to see him go,\nas his name and character certainly inspired confidence abroad--and some\ndelighted that he was no longer a member of such an advanced\ncabinet--(some said \"de cet infect gouvernement\"), where he was obliged\nby his mere presence to sanction many things he didn't approve of. He\nand Freycinet had a long talk on Wednesday, as W. naturally wanted to be\nsure that some provision would be made for his chef de cabinet and\nsecretaries. Each incoming minister brings his own staff with him.\nFreycinet offered W. the London Embassy, but he wouldn't take it, had\nhad enough of public life for the present. I didn't want it either, I\nhad never lived much in England, had not many friends there, and was\ncounting the days until we could get off to Rome. There was one funny\nresult of W. having declined the London Embassy. Admiral Pothnau, whom\nW. had named there, and who was very much liked, came to see him one day\nand made a great scene because Freycinet had offered him the London\nEmbassy. W. said he didn't understand why he made a scene, as he had\nrefused it. \"But it should never have been offered to you over my head.\"\n\"Perhaps, but that is not my fault. I didn't ask for it--and don't want\nit. If you think you have been treated badly, you should speak to\nFreycinet.\" However, the admiral was very much put out, and was very\ncool with us both for a long time. I suppose his idea was that being\nrecalled would mean that he had not done well in London, which was quite\na mistake, as he was very much liked there.\n\nWe dined alone that last night at the ministry, and sat some time in the\nwindow, looking at the crowds of people amusing themselves on the Seine,\nand wondering if we should ever see the Quai d'Orsay again. After all,\nwe had had two very happy interesting years there--and memories that\nwould last a lifetime.--Some of the last experiences of the month of\nDecember had been rather disillusioning, but I suppose one must not\nbring any sentiment into politics. In the world it is always a case of\ndonnant--donnant--and--when one is no longer in a position to give a\ngreat deal--people naturally turn to the rising man. Comte de P., chef\nde cabinet, came in late as usual, to have a last talk. He too had been\nbusy, as he had a small apartment and stables in the hotel of the\nministry, and was also very anxious to get away. He told us all the\nyoung men of the cabinet were very sorry to see W. go--at first they had\nfound him a little cold and reserved--but a two years' experience had\nshown them that, if he were not expansive, he was perfectly just, and\nalways did what he said he would.\n\nThe next day Madame de Freycinet came to see me, and we went over the\nhouse. She didn't care about the living-rooms, as they never lived at\nthe Quai d'Orsay, remained in their own hotel near the Bois de Boulogne.\nFreycinet came every day to the ministry, and she merely on reception\ndays--or when there was a party. Just as she was going, Madame de\nZuylen, wife of the Dutch minister, a great friend of mine, came in. She\ntold me she had great difficulty in getting up, as I had forbidden my\ndoor, but my faithful Gerard (I think I missed him as much as anything\nelse at first) knowing we were friends, thought Madame would like to see\nher. She paid me quite a long visit,--I even gave her some tea off\ngovernment plate and china,--all mine had been already sent to my own\nhouse. We sat talking for some time. She had heard that W. had refused\nthe London Embassy, was afraid it was a mistake, and that the winter in\nParis would be a difficult one for him--he would certainly be in\nopposition to the Government on all sorts of questions--and if he\nremained in Paris he would naturally go to the Senate and vote. I quite\nagreed that he couldn't suddenly detach himself from all political\ndiscussions--must take part in them and must vote. The policy of\nabstention has always seemed to me the weakest possible line in\npolitics. If a man, for some reason or another, hasn't the courage of\nhis opinions, he mustn't take any position where that opinion would\ncarry weight. I told her we were going to Italy as soon as we could get\noff after the holidays.\n\nWhile we were talking, a message came up to say that the young men of\nthe cabinet were all coming up to say good-bye to me. I had seen the\ndirectors earlier in the day, so Madame de Zuylen took her leave,\npromising to come to my Christmas tree in the rue Dumont d'Urville. The\nyoung men seemed sorry to say good-bye--I was, too. I had seen a great\ndeal of them and always found them ready and anxious to help me in\nevery way. The Comte de Lasteyrie, who was a great friend of ours as\nwell as a secretary, went about a great deal with us. W. called upon him\nvery often for all sorts of things, knowing he could trust him\nabsolutely. He told one of my friends that one of his principal\nfunctions was to accompany Madame Waddington to all the charity sales,\ncarrying a package of women's chemises under his arm. It was quite true\nthat I often bought \"poor clothes\" at the sales. The objects exposed in\nthe way of screens, pincushions, table-covers, and, in the spring, hats\nmade by some of the ladies, were so appalling that I was glad to have\npoor clothes to fall back upon, but I don't remember his ever carrying\nmy purchases home with me.\n\nThey were much amused when suddenly Francis burst into the room, having\nescaped a moment from his Nonnon, who was busy with her last packing,\nhis little face flushed and quivering with anger because his toys had\nbeen packed and he was to be taken away from the big house. He kicked\nand screamed like a little mad thing, until his nurse came to the\nrescue. I made a last turn in the rooms to see that all trace of my\noccupation had vanished. Francis, half pacified, was seated on the\nbilliard-table, an old grey-haired huissier, who was always on duty\nup-stairs, taking care of him. The huissiers and house servants were all\nassembled in the hall, and the old Pierson, who had been there for\nyears, was the spokesman, and hoped respectfully that Madame \"would soon\ncome back....\" W. didn't come with us, as he still had people to see and\nonly got home in time for a late dinner.\n\nWe dined that night and for many nights afterward with our uncle\nLutteroth (who had a charming hotel filled with pictures and bibelots\nand pretty things) just across the street, as it was some little time\nbefore our kitchen and household got into working order again. The first\nfew days were, of course, very tiring and uncomfortable--the house\nseemed so small after the big rooms at the Quai d'Orsay. I didn't\nattempt to do anything with the salons, as we were going away so\nsoon--carpets and curtains had to be arranged to keep the cold out, but\nthe big boxes remained in the carriage house--not unpacked. We had a\nprocession of visitors all day--and tried to make W.'s library\npossible--comfortable it wasn't, as there were packages of books and\npapers and boxes everywhere.\n\nI had a good many visits and flowers on New Year's day--which was an\nagreeable surprise--Lord Lyons, Orloff, the Sibberns, Comte de Sigur,\nM. Alfred Andre, and others. Andre, an old friend of W.'s, a very\nconservative Protestant banker, was very blue about affairs. Andre was\nthe type of the modern French Protestant. They are almost a separate\nclass in France--are very earnest, religious, honourable, narrow-minded\npeople. They give a great deal in charity and good works of all kinds.\nIn Paris the Protestant coterie is very rich. They associate with all\nthe Catholics, as many of them entertain a great deal, but they live\namong themselves and never intermarry. I hardly know a case where a\nFrench Protestant has married a Catholic. I suppose it is a remnant of\ntheir old Huguenot blood, and the memories of all their forefathers\nsuffered for their religion, which makes them so intolerant. The\nambassadors had paid their usual official visit to the Elysee--said\nGrevy was very smiling and amiable, didn't seem at all preoccupied. We\nhad a family dinner at my uncle's on New Year's night, and all the\nfamily with wonderful unanimity said the best wish they could make for\nW. was that 1880 would see him out of politics and leading an\nindependent if less interesting life.\n\nAn interesting life it certainly was, hearing so many questions\ndiscussed, seeing all sorts of people of all nationalities and living as\nit were behind the scenes. The Chamber of Deputies in itself was a\nstudy, with its astounding changes of opinion, with no apparent cause.\nOne never knew in the morning what the afternoon's session would bring,\nfor as soon as the Republican party felt themselves firmly established,\nthey began to quarrel among themselves. I went back to the ministry one\nafternoon to pay a formal visit to Madame de Freycinet on her reception\nday. I had rather put it off, thinking that the sight of the well-known\nrooms and faces would be disagreeable to me and make me regret, perhaps,\nthe past, but I felt already that all that old life was over--one adapts\none's self so quickly to different surroundings. It did seem funny to be\nannounced by my own special huissier, Gerard, and to find myself sitting\nin the green drawing-room with all the palms and flowers arranged just\nas they always were for me, and a semicircle of diplomats saying exactly\nthe same things to Madame de Freycinet that they had said to me a few\ndays before, but I fancy that always happens in these days of democracy\nand equalising education, and that under certain circumstances, we all\nsay and do exactly the same thing. I had quite a talk with Sibbern, the\nSwedish minister, who was very friendly and sympathetic, not only at our\nleaving the Foreign Office, but at the extreme discomfort of moving in\nsuch frightfully cold weather. He was wrapped in furs, as if he were\ngoing to the North Pole. However, I assured him we were quite warm and\ncomfortable, gradually settling down into our old ways, and I was\nalready looking back on my two years at the Quai d'Orsay as an agreeable\nepisode in my life. I had quite a talk too with the Portuguese minister,\nMendes Leal. He was an interesting man, a poet and a dreamer, saw more,\nI fancy, of the literary world of Paris than the political. Blowitz was\nthere, of course--was always everywhere in moments of crisis, talking a\ngreat deal, and letting it be understood that he had pulled a great many\nwires all those last weeks. He too regretted that W. had not taken the\nLondon Embassy, assured me that it would have been a very agreeable\nappointment in England--was surprised that I hadn't urged it. I replied\nthat I had not been consulted. Many people asked when they could come\nand see me--would I take up my reception day again? That wasn't worth\nwhile, as I was going away so soon, but I said I would be there every\nday at five o'clock, and always had visits.\n\n[Illustration: Mme. Sadi Carnot. From a drawing by Mlle. Amelie\nBeaury-Saurel.]\n\nOne day Madame Sadi Carnot sat a long time with me. Her husband had been\nnamed undersecretary at the Ministry of Public Works in the new\ncabinet, and she was very pleased. She was a very charming, intelligent,\ncultivated woman--read a great deal, was very keen about politics and\nvery ambitious (as every clever woman should be) for her husband and\nsons. I think she was a great help socially to her husband when he\nbecame President of the Republic. He was a grave, reserved man, didn't\ncare very much for society. I saw her very often and always found her\nmost attractive. At the Elysee she was amiable and courteous to\neverybody and her slight deafness didn't seem to worry her nor make\nconversation difficult. She did such a charming womanly thing just after\nher husband's assassination. He lay in state for some days at the\nElysee, and M. Casimir Perier, his successor, went to make her a visit.\nAs he was leaving he said his wife would come the next day to see Madame\nCarnot. She instantly answered, \"Pray do not let her come; she is young,\nbeginning her life here at the Elysee. I wouldn't for worlds that she\nshould have the impression of sadness and gloom that must hang over the\npalace as long as the President is lying there. I should like her to\ncome to the Elysee only when all traces of this tragedy have gone--and\nto have no sad associations--on the contrary, with the prospect of a\nlong happy future before her.\"\n\n[Illustration: _Photograph, copyright by Pierre Petit, Paris._\nPresident Sadi Carnot.]\n\nW. went the two or three Fridays we were in Paris to the Institute,\nwhere he was most warmly received by his colleagues, who had much\nregretted his enforced absences the years he was at the Foreign Office.\nHe told them he was going to Rome, where he hoped still to find some\ntreasures in the shape of inscriptions inedites, with the help of his\nfriend Lanciani. The days passed quickly enough until we started. It was\nnot altogether a rest, as there were always so many people at the house,\nand W. wanted to put order into his papers before he left. Freycinet\nmade various changes at the Quai d'Orsay. M. Desprey, Directeur de la\nPolitique (a post he had occupied for years) was named ambassador to\nRome in the place of the Marquis de Gabriac. I don't think he was very\nanxious to go. His career had been made almost entirely at the Foreign\nOffice, and he was much more at home in his cabinet, with all his papers\nand books about him, than he would be abroad among strangers. He came to\ndinner one night, and we talked the thing over. W. thought the rest and\nchange would do him good. He was named to the Vatican, where necessarily\nthere was much less to do in the way of social life than at the\nQuirinal. He was perfectly au courant of all the questions between the\nVatican and the French clergy--his son, secretary of embassy, would go\nwith him. It seemed rather a pleasant prospect.\n\nW. went once or twice to the Senate, as the houses met on the 12th or\n14th of January, but there was nothing very interesting those first\ndays. The Chamber was taking breath after the holidays and the last\nministerial crisis, and giving the new ministry a chance. I think\nFreycinet had his hands full, but he was quite equal to the task. I went\nlate one afternoon to the Elysee. I had written to Madame Grevy to ask\nif she would receive me before I left for Italy. When I arrived, the one\nfootman at the door told me Madame Grevy was un peu souffrante, would\nsee me up-stairs. I went up a side staircase, rather dark, preceded by\nthe footman, who ushered me into Madame Grevy's bedroom. It looked\nperfectly uncomfortable--was large, with very high ceilings, stiff gilt\nfurniture standing against the wall, and the heat something awful,--a\nblazing fire in the chimney. Madame Grevy was sitting in an armchair,\nnear the fire, a grey shawl on her shoulders and a lace fichu on her\nhead. It was curiously unlike the bedroom I had just left. I had been to\nsee a friend, who was also souffrante. She was lying under a lace\ncoverlet lined with pink silk, lace, and embroidered cushions all\naround her, flowers, pink lamp-shades, silver flacons, everything most\nluxurious and modern. The contrast was striking. Madame Grevy was very\ncivil, and talkative,--said she was very tired. The big dinners and late\nhours she found very fatiguing. She quite understood that I was glad to\nget away, but didn't think it was very prudent to travel in such\nbitterly cold weather--and Rome was very far, and wasn't I afraid of\nfever? I told her I was an old Roman--had lived there for years, knew\nthe climate well, and didn't think it was worse than any other. She said\nthe President had had a visit from W. and a very long talk with him, and\nthat he regretted his departure very much, but that he didn't think\n\"Monsieur Waddington was au fond de son sac.\" Grevy was always a good\nfriend to W.--on one or two occasions, when there was a sort of cabal\nagainst him, Grevy took his part very warmly--and in all questions of\nhome policy and persons W. found him a very keen, shrewd\nobserver--though he said very little--rarely expressed an opinion. I\ndidn't make a very long visit--found my way down-stairs as well as I\ncould--no servant was visible either on the stairs or in the hall, and\nmy own footman opened the big doors and let me out. We got off the first\ndays of February--as, up to the last moment, W. had people to see. We\nwent for two or three days to Bourneville--I had one or two very cold\ntramps in the woods (very dry) which is quite unusual at this time of\nthe year, but the earth was frozen hard. Inside the woods we were well\nsheltered, but when we came out on the plain the cold and icy wind was\nawful. The workmen had made fires to burn the roots and rotten wood, and\nwe were very glad to stop and warm ourselves. Some had their children\nwith them, who looked half perished with cold, always insufficiently\nclad, but they were quite happy roasting potatoes in the ashes. I was so\ncold that I tied a woollen scarf around my head, just as the women in\nCanada do when they go sleighing or skating.\n\nWe had a breakfast one day for some of W.'s influential men in the\ncountry, who were much disgusted at the turn affairs had taken and that\nW. could no longer remain minister, but they were very fairly au courant\nof all that was going on in Parliament, and quite understood that for\nthe moment the moderate, experienced men had no chance. The young\nRepublic must have its fling. Has the country learned much or gained\nmuch in its forty years of Republic?\n\n\n\n\nINDEX\n\n\nAdams, Sir Francis, school friend of\n  M.

Since then, the whole face of\nAmerican history has changed. We have had the Spanish-American War, and\nthe opening-up of our new possessions. In this period of time Gladstone,\nLi Hung Chang, and Queen Victoria have died; there has also occurred the\nassassination of the Empress of Austria and of President McKinley. There\nhas been the Chinese persecution, the destruction of Galveston by storm\nand of Martinique by volcanic action. Wireless telegraphy has been\ndiscovered, and the source of the spread of certain fevers. In this time\nhave been carried on gigantic engineering undertakings,--the\nTrans-Siberian Railroad, the Trans-Balkan Railroad, the rebuilding of\nNew York. We have also looked upon the consolidation of vast forces of\nsteel, iron, sugar, shipping, and other trusts. We have witnessed an\nextraordinary growth of universities, libraries, and higher\nschools,--the widespread increase of commerce, the prosperity of\nbusiness, the rise in the price of food, and the great coal-strike of\n1902. Perhaps never before in the world's history have there been\ncrowded into five years such dramatic occurrences on the world-stage,\nnor such large opportunities for the individual man or woman.\n\nIt is interesting for me to notice that since the first outlines of the\nbook were written, many things then set down as prophecy have now been\nfulfilled. It was my purpose, in projecting the essays at what seemed\nto me to be the dawn of a great religious era, to help the onward\nmovement by a few earnest words. History itself has swept the world far\nbeyond one's dreams, and in completing them, I only ask that they may\nstand a further witness to the overwhelming majesty and influence of the\nChristian faith.\n\nANNA ROBERTSON BROWN LINDSAY\n\n_Philadelphia, November_ 1_st_, 1902\n\n\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n  I.

Fate and man are not altogether at odds. Yet\nthere is a perpetual combat going on between man and nature, and between\nthe power of character and the tyranny of circumstance, death, and sin.\nThe great soul is tossed into the midst of the strife, the longing, and\nthe aspirations of the world. He rises Victor who is triumphant in some\ngreat experience of the race.\n\nThe first energy is combative: the Warrior is the primitive hero. There\nare natures to whom mere combat is a joy. Strife is the atmosphere in\nwhich they find their finest physical and spiritual development. In the\nearly times, there must have been those who stood apart from their\ntribesmen in contests of pure athletic skill,--in running, jumping,\nleaping, wrestling, in laying on thew and thigh with arm, hand, and\ncurled fist in sheer delight of action, and of the display of strength.\nAs foes arose, these athletes of the tribe or clan would be the first to\nrush forth to slay the wild beast, to brave the sea and storm, or to\nwreak vengeance on assailing tribes. Their valor was their insignia.\nTheir prowess ranked them. Their exultation was in their freedom\nand strength.\n\nSuch men did not ask a life of ease. Like Tortulf the Forester, they\nlearned \"how to strike the foe, to sleep on the bare ground, to bear\nhunger and toil, summer's heat and winter's frost,--how to fear nothing\nbut ill-fame.\" They courted danger, and asked only to stand as Victors\nat the last.\n\nHence we read of old-world warriors,--of Gog and Magog and the Kings of\nBashan; of the sons of Anak; of Hercules, with his lion-skin and club;\nof Beowulf, who, dragging the sea-monster from her lair, plunged beneath\nthe drift of sea-foam and the flame of dragon-breath, and met the clutch\nof dragon-teeth. We read of Turpin, Oliver, and Roland,--the\nsweepers-off of twenty heads at a single blow; of Arthur, who slew\nRitho, whose mantle was furred with the beards of kings; of Theodoric\nand Charlemagne, and of Richard of the Lion-heart.\n\nThere are also Victors in the great Quests of the world,--the Argonauts,\nHelena in search of the Holy Rood, the Knights of the Holy Grail, the\nPilgrim Fathers. There are the Victors in the intellectual wrestlings of\nthe world,--the thinkers, poets, sages; the Victors in great sorrows,\nwho conquer the savage pain of heart and desolation of spirit which\narise from heroic human grief,--Oedipus and Antigone, Iphigenia,\nPerseus, Prometheus, King Lear, Samson Agonistes, Job, and David in his\npenitential psalm. And there are the Victors in the yet deeper strivings\nof the soul--in its inner battles and spiritual conquests--Milton's\nAdam, Paracelsus, Dante, the soul in _The Palace of Art_, Abt Vogler,\nIsaiah, Teufelsdroeckh, Paul. To read of such men and women is to be\nthrilled by the Titanic possibilities of the soul of man!\n\nThe world has come into other and greater battle-days. This is an era of\ngreat spiritual conflicts, and of great triumphs. To-day faith calls the\nsoul of man to arms. It is a clarion to awake, to put on strength, and\nto go forth to Holy War. If there were no fighting work in the Christian\nlife, much of the intense energy and interest of the race would be\nunaroused. There are apathetic natures who do not want to undertake the\ndifficult,--sluggish souls who would rather not stir from their present\nposition. And there are cowards who run to cover. But there is\nin all strong natures the primitive combative instinct,--the\nlet-us-see-which-is-the-stronger, which delights in contests, which is\nundismayed by opposition, and which grows firmer through the warfare\nof the soul.\n\nIt is this phase of the Christian life which is most needed to-day,--the\nwarrior-spirit, the all-conquering soul. In entering the Christian life,\none must put out of his heart the expectation that it is to be an easy\nlife, or one removed from toil and danger. It is preeminently the\nadventurous life of the world,--that in which the most happens, as well\nas that in which the spiritual possibilities are the greatest. It is a\nlife full of splendor, of excitement, of trial, of tests of courage and\nendurance, and is meant to appeal to those who are the very bravest\nand the best.\n\nThere are two forms of conquest to which the soul of man is called--the\ninner and the outer. The inner is the conquest of the evil within his\nown nature; the outer is the struggle against the evil forces of the\nworld--the constructive task of building up, under warring conditions,\nthe spiritual kingdom of God.\n\nThe real world is far more subtle than we as yet understand. When we\ndive down into the deep, sky and air and houses disappear. We enter a\nnew world--the under-world of water, and things that glide and swim; of\nsea-grasses and currents; of flowing waves that lap about the body with\na cool chill; of palpitating color, that, at great depths, becomes a\nsort of darkness; of sea-beds of shell and sand, and bits of scattered\nwreckage; of ooze and tangled sea-plants, dusky shapes, and\nfan-like fins.\n\nOr if we look upward we reach an over-world, where moons and suns are\ncircling in the heights. What draws them together? What keeps a subtle\ndistance between them, which they never cross? How do they, age after\nage, run a predestined course? We drop a stone. What binds it earthward?\nUnder our feet run magnetic currents that flow from pole to pole. In the\nclouds above, there are electric vibrations which cannot be described\nin exact terms.\n\nThus also, in spiritual experiences, there are currents which we cannot\nmeasure or describe. The psychic world is the final world, though its\ntowers and pinnacles no eye hath seen. If we try to shut out for an hour\nthe outer world, and descend into the soul-world of the life of man, we\nfind ourselves in a new environment, and with an outlook over new forms\nand powers. We find ourselves in a world of images and attractions, of\nimpulses and desires, of instincts and attainments. It is not only a\nworld of separate and individual souls, but each soul is as a thousand;\nfor within each man there is an inner host contending for mastery, and\neverywhere is the uproar of battle and of spiritual strife.\n\nWhat is the Self that abides in each man? Is it not the consciousness of\nexistence, together with a consciousness of the power of choice? Our\nindividuality lies in the fact that we can decide, choose, and rule\namong the various contestant impulses of our souls. Herein is the\npossibility of victory and also the possibility of defeat.\n\nLooking inward, we find that Self began when man began. We inherit our\ndispositions from Adam, as well as from our parents and a long ancestral\nline. When the first men and women were created, forces were set in\naction which have resulted in this Me that to-day thinks and wills and\nloves. Heredity includes savagery and culture, health and disease,\nempire and serfdom, hope and despair. Each man can say: \"In me rise\nimpulses that ran riot in the veins of Anak, that belonged to Libyan\nslaves and to the Ptolemaic line. I am Aryan and Semite, Roman and\nTeuton: alike I have known the galley and the palm-set court of kings.\nUnder a thousand shifting generations, there was rising the combination\nthat I to-day am. In me culminates, for my life's day, human history\nuntil now.\"\n\nIndividuality is thus a unique selection and arrangement of what has\nbeen, touched with something--a degree of life--that has not been\nbefore. To rise above heredity is to rise above the downward drag of all\nthe years. It is not escaping the special sin of one ancestor, but the\nsin of all ancestors. _This is the first problem that is set before each\nman: to rise above his race--to be the culmination of virtue until now_.\n\n_The second problem is not greater, but different. It is to mould\nenvironment to spiritual uses_. The conditions of this struggle and the\nopportunities of this conquest are the content of this book. It is meant\nto deal with the more heroic aspects of the Christian life.\n\nWhat is environment? Is it the material horizon that bounds us? If so,\nwhere does it end? Our first environment is a crib, a room, our mother's\neyes. Sensations of hunger, heat, and motion beat upon the baby-brain;\nthere is a vague murmur of sound in the baby-ears. Yet it is this babe\nwho, in after days, has all the universe for his soul's demesne! His\nenvironment stretches out to towns and rivers, shore and sea. Looking\nupward into space, he can view a star whose distance is a thousand times\nten thousand miles. Beyond the path of his feet or of his sight, there\nis the path of thought, which leads him into new countries, new climes,\nnew years! His meditations are upon ages gone; his work competes with\nthat of the dead. In his reveries and imaginings, he can transport\nhimself anywhither, and can commune with any friend or god. Hence to be\nmaster of one's environment is really to have the universe within\none's grasp.\n\nWe are too much afraid of customs and traditions. We are put into our\ntimes, not that the times may mould us, but that we may mould the times!\nWays? Customs? They exist to be changed! The _tempora_ and the _mores_\nshould be plastic to our touch. The times are never level with our best.\nOur souls are higher than the _Zeitgeist_. Why should we cringe before\nan inferior essence or command? But society seals our lips: we walk\nabout with frozen tongues.\n\nEach asks himself at some time: How shall I become one of the Victors of\nthe race? Is it in me? Mankind is weighted by every previous sin. Where\nam I free? How am I free? Can I do as I choose? Or are there bourns of\nconduct beyond which I can never go? Am I foreordained to sin? Do the\nstars in their courses lay limitations on free will?\n\nThere are in man two forces working: a human longing after God, and, in\nresponse, God inly working in the soul. The Victor is he who, in his own\nlife, unites these two things: a great longing after the god-like, which\nmakes him yearn for virtue,--and the divine power within him, through\nwhich and by which he is triumphant over time and death and sin.\n\nWhatever our trials, sorrows, or temptations, joy and courage are ever\nmeant to be in the ascendant; life, however it may break in storms upon\nus, is not meant to beat down our souls. Unless we are triumphant, we\nare not wholly useful or well trained. Will and heart together work\nfor victory.\n\nAs there flashes and thrills through all nature a subtle electric\nvibration which is the supreme form of physical energy, so there runs\nthrough the history of mankind a current of spiritual inspiration and\npower. To possess this magnetism of soul, this heroism of life, this\nflame-like flower of character, is to be Victor in the great combats of\nthe race. It is the spirit of courage, energy, and love. Nothing is too\nhard for it, nothing too distasteful, nothing too insignificant. Through\nall the course of duty it spurs one to do one's best. Its essence is to\novercome. This is the indwelling Holy Spirit, wherein is freedom, power,\nand rest. To its final triumph all things are accessory. To joy, all\npowers converge.\n\n\n\n\nII. PRELUDE: THE CALL OF JESUS\n\n     [VOX DILECTI]\n\n     _I heard the voice of Jesus say\n       Come unto Me and rest;\n     Lay down, thou weary one, lay down\n       Thy head upon My breast.\n     I came to Jesus as I was,\n       Weary and worn and sad;\n     I found in Him a resting-place,\n       And He has made me glad._\n\n     _I heard the voice of Jesus say\n       Behold I freely give\n     The living water; thirsty one,\n       Stoop down and drink, and live.\n     I came to Jesus, and I drank\n       Of that life-giving stream;\n     My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,\n       And now I live in Him._\n\n     _I heard the voice of Jesus say\n       I am this dark world's light;\n     Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,\n       And all thy day be bright.\n     I looked to Jesus, and I found\n       In Him my star, my sun;\n     And in that light of life I'll walk,\n       Till travelling days are done._\n\n     HORATIUS BONAR\n\nIt is a world of voices in which we live. We are daily visited by\nappeals which are ministering to our growth and progress, or which are\ntending to our spiritual downfall. There are the voices of nature, in\nsky, and sea, and storm; the voices of childhood and of early youth; the\nvoices of playfellows and companions,--voices long stilled, it may be,\nin death; the voices of lover and beloved; the voices of ambition, of\nsorrow, of aspiration, and of joy.\n\nBut among all these many voices, there is one which is most inspiring\nand supreme. When the _Vorspiel_ to _Parsifal_ breaks upon the ear it is\nas if all other music were inadequate and incomplete--as if a voice\ncalled from the confines of eternity, in the infinite spaces where no\ntime is, and rolled onward to the far-off ages when time shall be no\nmore. Even so, high and clear above the voices of the world, deeper and\ntenderer than any other word or tone, comes the voice of Jesus to the\nsoul of man.\n\nLook, if you will, upon the World of Souls, many-tiered and vast,\nstretching from day's end to day's end,--a world of hunger and of anger,\nof toiling and of striving, of clamor and of triumph,--a dim, upheaving\nmass, which from century to century wakes, and breathes, and sleeps\nagain! Years roll on, tides flow, but there is no cessation of the march\nof years, and no whisper of a natural change. Is it not a strange thing\nthat one voice, and only one, should have really won the hearing of the\nrace? What is this voice of Jesus, so enduring, matchless, and supreme?\nWhat does it promise, for the help or hope of man?\n\nThere are some who say that Jesus has held the attention and allegiance\nof the race by an appeal to the religious instinct; that all men\nnaturally seek God, and long to know Him. But if we try to define the\nreligious instinct, we shall find it a hard task. What might be called a\nreligious instinct leads to human sacrifice upon the Aztec altar;\ndirects the Hindu to cast the new-born child in the stream, the friend\nto sacrifice his best friend to a pagan deity.\n\nThere are others who say that Christ appeals to the gentler instincts of\nman,--to his unselfishness, his meekness and compassion. Yet some of the\nmost admirable Christians have been ambitious and aggressive. Others\nsay, He appeals to our need of help. But self-reliance is a Christian\ntrait. Others say, He appeals to our sense of sin--our need of pardon.\nBut many a Christian goes through life like a happy child, scarcely\nconscious at any time of deep guilt, and never overwhelmed by intense\nconviction or despair.\n\nThe truth seems to be that Christ appeals to our whole selves. He calls\nus by an attraction which is unique. In the universe there exists a\nforce which we must recognize--though we do not yet in the least\nunderstand it--which is gradually drawing the race Christward. The law\nof spiritual gravitation is, that by all the changing impulses of our\nnature we are drawn upward unto Him. Spohr's lovely anthem voices this\ncry of the soul:\n\n     \"_As pants the hart for cooling streams,\n       When heated in the chase,\n     So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,\n       And Thy refreshing grace.\n\n     \"For Thee, my God, the living God,\n       My thirsty soul doth pine;\n     Oh! when shall I behold Thy face,\n       Thou Majesty divine_?\"\n\n1. Jesus calls us by the mystery of life. There are hours of silence and\nmeditation when the great thought _I am_ beats in upon the soul. But\nwhat am I? Whence came I? A heap of atoms in some strange human\nsemblance--is that all? And so many other heaps of atoms have already\nbeen, and passed away! Blown hither and thither--where? The universe\nreels with change. Star-dust and earth-dust are alike in ceaseless\nwhirl. Little it profits to build the spire, the sea-wall, the dome, the\nbridge, the myriad-roofed town. A new era shall dawn upon them, and they\nshall fall away.\n\nNot only that, but each man who lives to-day has less possible material\ndominion than he had who preceded him. Only so many square feet of\nearth, and now there are more to walk upon them! The ground we tread was\nonce trodden by the feet of those long dead. I am taking up their room,\nand in due time I must myself depart, that there may be footway for\nthose who are to come after me. Only the under-sod is really mine--the\nlittle earth-barrow to which I go.\n\nThere is no question more baffling than this simple, ever-recurring one:\nWhat am I? If I should decide what I am to-day, I discover that\nyesterday I was quite a different person. To-day I may be six feet in\nheight, and climb the Alps; yesterday I lay helpless in swaddling\nclothes. Yesterday I was a thing of laughter and frolic; to-day I am\ngrave, and brush away tears. As a babe, was I still I? What is Myself?\nWhen did I come to Myself? How far can I extend Myself? My feet are\nhere, but in a moment my spirit can flee to Xanadu and Zanzibar. There\nis no spot in the universe where I may not go. Where, then, are the\nlimits of Myself?\n\nPersonality is never for a single moment fixed: it is as changing and\nevanescent as a cloud. We are whirlwind spirits, swept through time and\nspace, bearing within our souls hopes, fears, joys, sorrows, which are\nnever twice the same. Every aspect of the universe leaves new\nimpressions on us, and our wills, in their world-sweep, daily desire\ndifferent things.\n\nIncompleteness lies on life--restlessness is in the heart. True love has\nno final habitation on earth; there is no abiding-place for our deepest\naffection, our most tender yearning. It is curious how deeply one may\nlove, and yet feel that there is something more. In all our journeys,\nskyward and sunward, we never reach the End of All.\n\nOver against this vague and changing self, there stands out the figure\nof the changeless Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and forever. In\nHim we find the environment of all our lives, and the sum of all\nour dreams.\n\n2. Jesus calls us by our earth-born cares. In Mendelssohn's _Elijah_,\nthere is a voice which sings: \"O rest in the Lord!\" This angel's message\nis the voice of Jesus to the human race.\n\nThe voice of Jesus calls us to awake to toil. We sometimes forget this,\nand imagine that if we follow Jesus, we shall never have anything to do.\nChrist does not still the machinery of the world, nor shut the mine, nor\ntake away the sowing and the reaping. The call of Jesus is not a call to\nrest from work, but to rest in work. The rest we receive is that of\nsympathy, of inspiration, of efficiency. Christ really increases the\ntoil-capacity of man. Man can do more work, harder work, and always\nbetter work, because of the faith that is in him. What makes the\nconfusion and fatigue of life is, that men are everywhere scrambling\nfor themselves, and trying to manage their own undertakings, instead of\nfalling into harmony with God, and through Him, with all that is. What\nwears the soul out is not the work of life itself--it is its drudgery,\nits monotony, its blind vagueness, its apparent purposelessness. We do\nnot wish to scatter our lives and spend our years in nothingness.\n\nChrist comes into the world and says: Over-fatigue is abnormal. There\nis not enough work in the universe to tire every one all out. There is\njust enough for each one to do happily, and to do well. I am come as the\ngreat industrial organizer. My mission is not to take away toil, but to\nredistribute it. My industrial plan is the largest of history--it is\nalso the most simple. I look down over the world, as a master upon his\nmen. My work is not to found an earthly kingdom, as some have thought;\nit is not primarily to set up industrial establishments, or syndicates,\nor ways of transport and trade. My work is to build up in the universe a\nspiritual kingdom of energy, power, and progress. To this kingdom all\nmaterial things are accessory. In My hand are all abilities, as well as\nall knowledge. Not a sparrow falls to the ground without My notice. Not\na lily blooms without My delight. Not a brick is laid, not a stone is\nset, not an axe is swung, except beneath My eye. I provide for My own.\nTo each man I assign his work, his task. If he takes upon him only what\nI give him to do, he will never be under-paid, or over-tired.\n\nHence the first step towards an industrial millennium is to arise and do\nwhat Jesus bids. Heaven is heaven because no one is unruly there, or\nidle, or lazy, or vicious, or morose. Each soul is at true and happy\nwork. Each energy is absorbed; each hour is alive with interest, and\nthere are no oppressive thoughts or ways.\n\nIf each heart and soul responded to the call of Jesus, there would be a\nnew heaven and a new earth--a Utopia such as More never dreamed of, nor\nPlato, nor Bellamy, nor Campanella in his _City of the Sun_. Each hand\nwould be at its own work; each eye would be upon its own task; each foot\nwould be in the right path. All the fear, the weariness, the squalor,\nand the unrest of life would be done away. The life of each man would be\na life of contentment, and of economic advance.\n\n3. Jesus calls us by the scourging of our sins. Flagellation is not of\nthe body--it is of the soul. Remorse is as a scorpion-whip, and memory\nbeats us with many stripes. The first sin that besets us is\nforgetfulness of God. Apathy creeps over the spirit, and sloth winds\nitself about our deeds. Nothing is more pathetic than the decline of the\nmerely forgetful soul. \"Be sleepless in the things of the spirit,\" says\nPythagoras, \"for sleep in them is akin to death.\"\n\nSin lifts bars against success: the root of failure lies in irreligion.\nPride, conceit, disobedience, malice, evil-speaking, covetousness,\nidolatry, vice, oppression, injustice, and lack of truth and honor fight\nmore strongly against one's career than any other foe. No sin is without\nits lash; no experience of evil but has its rebound. To expect a higher\nmoral insight in middle age because of a larger experience of sin in\nyouth, is as reasonable as to look for sanity of judgment in middle age\nbecause in youth a man had fits!\n\nLooking at ourselves in a mirror, do we not sometimes think how we would\nfashion ourselves if we could create a new self, in the image of some\nideal which is before us? Would we not make ourselves wholly beautiful\nif we could make ourselves?\n\nEven so, looking out upon our own spirits, do we not some day rouse to\nthe distortion and deformity of sin? Do we wish to retain these\ngrimacing phases of ourselves? Do we not yearn eagerly for the dignity\nand beauty of high virtue? Do we not long for the graces and perfections\nwhich make up a radiant and happy life? If we could be born again, would\nwe not be born a more spiritual being?\n\nIt is to this new birth that Jesus calls our souls. All around the babe,\nhid in its mother's womb, there lies a world of which it has neither\nsight nor knowledge. The fact that the babe is ignorant does not change\nthe fact that the world is there. So about our souls there lies the\ninvisible world of God, which, until born of the Spirit, we do not see\nor understand. It is a world in which God is everywhere; in which there\nis no First Cause, except God; in which there is no will, except the\nwill of God; in which there is no true and perfect love, except from\nGod; no truth, except revealed by God; no power, except from Him.\n\nConversion is the outlook over a world which is arranged, not for our\nown glory, but for the good of God's creatures; in which what we do is\nnecessary, fundamental, permanent--not because we ourselves have done it\nwell, nor, in truth, because we have done it at all--but because what we\nhave done is a part of the universe which God is building. We change\nfrom a self-centre to a God-centre; from the thought of whether the\nworld applauds to whether God approves; from the thought of keeping our\nown life to the thought of preserving our own integrity; from isolation\nfrom all other souls to a sympathy with them, an understanding of their\nneeds, and a desire to help their lives. It is a turning from a delight\nin sin, or an indifference to sin, or merely a moral aversion to it, to\na deep-rooted hatred of every thought and act of sin, to penitence, and\nto an earnest desire to pattern after God.\n\n4. Jesus calls us by our sorrows, Jesus calls us by our dreams. He\nthrills us by each high aim that life inspires. His voice is one of\nunderstanding, of tenderness, of human appeal. How could we love Jesus\nif He did not sympathize with our ideals? But here is a Divine One in\nwhose sight we are not visionary; who lovingly guards our least hope;\nwho welcomes our faintest spiritual insight; who takes an interest in\nour social plans, and points out to us the great kingdom that is to be.\nChrist lays hold of the divine that is in us, and will not let us go.\n\n5. Jesus calls us by our latent gifts and powers. Which of us has ever\nexhausted his possibilities? Which of us is all that he might be?\n\nIt is an impressive thought, that nothing in the universe ever gets used\nup. It changes form, motion, semblance,--but the force, the energy,\nneither wastes nor dies away. Air--it is as fresh as the air that blew\nover the Pharaohs. Sun--it is as undimmed as the sun that looked down on\nthe completion of Cheops. Earth--it is as unworn as the earth that was\ntrodden by the cavemen.\n\nNo generation can ever bequeath to us a single new material atom. The\nrace is ever in old clothes. Nor can we hand down to others one atom\nwhich was not long ere we were born. Yet the vitality of the universe is\nbeing constantly increased, and this increase is also permanent. God has\na great deal more to work with now than a thousand years ago.\n\nFor not all energy is material. With each birth there comes a new force\ninto the world, and its influence never dies. The body is born of ages\npast, of the material stores of centuries; but the soul, in its living,\nthinking, working power, is a new phase of energy added to the energy\nof the race.\n\nThis fact confers on each individual man a strange impressiveness and\npower. It gives a new significance to the fact that I am. I am something\ndifferent from what has been, or ever shall be. In the great whirling\nmyriads, I am distinguished and apart. I am an appreciable factor in\nuniversal development and a being of elemental power. By every true\nthought of mine the race becomes wiser. By every right deed, its\ninheritance of tradition is uplifted; by every high affection, its\nhorizon of love is enlarged. We can bequeath to others this new\nspiritual energy of our lives.\n\nThis thought gives us a new zest for life. There is an appetite which is\nof the soul. It is this wish for growth, for the development of our\npowers, for a larger life for ourselves and for those who shall\ncome after us.\n\nIs there any one who wishes to stay always where he is to-day?--to be\nalways what he is this morning? Beyond the hill-top lies our dream. Not\nall the voices that call men from place to place are audible ones. We\nhear whispers from a far-off leader; we are beckoned by an unseen guide.\nOut of ancestry, tradition, talent, and training each departs to\nhis own way.\n\nWhat calls is not largeness of place--it is largeness of ideal. To each\nof us, thinking of this one and that one who has taken a large part in\nthe shaping of the world, there comes a feeling: Beside all these I am\nin a narrow way! What can I think that shall be worth the consideration\nof the race? What can I do that shall be a stepping-stone to progress?\nWhat can I hope that shall unseal other eyes to the universal glory,\ncomfort others in the universal pain? We say: I do not want to be mewed\nup here, while others are out where thrones and empires are sweeping by!\nI do not want to parse verbs, add fractions, and mark ledgers, while\nothers are the poets, the singers, the statesmen, the rulers, and the\nwealth-controllers of the world! We wish to step out of the trivial\nexperience into that which is significant. Each day brings uneasiness of\nsoul. \"Man's unhappiness,\" says Carlyle, \"as I construe it, comes of his\ngreatness; it is because there is an infinite in him, which with all his\ncunning he cannot quite bury under the finite.\" Says Tennyson:\n\n     \"_It is not death for which we pant,\n      But life, more life, and fuller, that we want_.\"\n\nThese aspirations are prophetic. Does a clod-hopper dream? We move\ntoward our desires. The wish for growth is but the call of Jesus to our\nsouls. We sometimes hear of the \"limitations of life.\" What are they?\nWho set them? Man himself, not God. The call of Jesus urges the soul of\nman to possibilities which are infinite.\n\nA large life is the fulfilment of God's ideal of our lives--the life\nwhich, from all eternity, He has looked upon as possible for us. Could\nany career be grander than the one that God has planned for us? God does\nnot think petty thoughts: He longs for grandeur for us all.\n\n6. Jesus calls us by the spirit of the times. There is a growing\nrecognition of the affinity between God and the human soul. Religion has\nchanged in spirit as well as in form. It used to be considered a tract\nin one's experience, and now it is perceived to be all of life--its\nimpetus, its central moving force, the reason for being, activity,\ndevelopment, for ethical conduct, and for unselfish and joyous\nhelpfulness. Religion is more and more perceived to be, not a thing of\nfeeble sentiment, of restraint, of exaction, of meek subordination and\nresignation, but the unfolding of the free human spirit to the\nrealization of its highest possibilities and its allegiance to that\nwhich is eternal and supreme. The nineteenth century closes with the\nthinker who is also a man of meditation and devotion. We offer to Heaven\nthe incense of aspiration, hope, research, talent, and imagination.\n\nThe chief thing toward which we are moving is, I believe, the\nEnthronement of the Christ. Christ has always been, in the hearts of the\nfew, enthroned and enshrined. Even in the dark years of mediaeval\nsuperstition and unrest, there were the cloistered ones who maintained\ntraditions of faith and did works of mercy, as there were knightly ones\nwho upheld the ministry of chivalry, and followed, though afar, the\ntender shining of the Holy Grail. But now all the signs point to a great\nand general recognition of the Christ--Christ to be lifted high on the\nhands of the nations, to His throne above the stars!\n\nA new spiritual note is to be heard in modern subjects of study, is\nnoticeable in all paths of intellectual prestige. History is no more\nlooked upon as the story of the trophies of warriors, conquerors, and\nkings. History, rising out of dim mists, is seen to be the marching and\nthe countermarching of nations in the throes of progress and of social\nchange. It is not the story of princes alone, but of peasants as well;\nthe result of myriads of small, obscure lives; of changing conditions;\nof the movements of great economic, psychologic, and spiritual forces.\nLooking backward over the moving processional of the nations of the\nearth, we may see how, without rest, without pause, through countless\nages, the myriad legions of men have been passing across the scene of\nlife--passing, and fading away!\n\n   \"_All that tread\n   The globe are but a handful of the tribes\n   That slumber in its bosom_.\"\n\nEmpires have risen, and empires have decayed; dynasties have been\nburied, and long lines of kings, wrapping stately robes about them, have\nlain down to die. Thrones have been overturned, armies and navies have\nbeen mustered and scattered, land and sea have been peopled and made\ndesolate, as the thronging tribes and races have lived their little life\nand passed away. Babylon and Assyria, India and Arabia, Egypt and\nPersia, Rome and Greece,--each of these has had its lands and conquests,\nits song and story, its wars and tumults, its wrath and praise. Under\nall the tides of conquest and endeavor but one fact shines supreme: the\nsteady progress of the Cross.\n\nOne principle of growth and development is being slowly revealed,--an\napproach to symmetry and civic form, which is seen in freedom, justice,\npopular education, the rise of masses, the power of public opinion, and\na general regard for life, health, peace, national prosperity, and the\nindividual weal. The day has passed when men merely lived, slept, ate,\nfought; they are now involved in an intricate and progressive\ncivilization. Sociology, ethics, and politics are newly blazed pathways\nfor its development, its guidance, and its ideals. We are moving on to\nnew dreams of patriotism, of statesmanship, and of civil rule.\n\nLiterature, instead of being considered as merely an expression of the\nprimitive experiences of a race in its sagas, glees, ballads, dramas,\nand larger works and songs, is more and more revealing itself as an\nappeal to the Highest in the supreme moments of life. It is the\nunfolding panorama of the concepts of the soul in regard to duty,\nconduct, love, and hope. Literature asks: What do I live for? as well\nas, How shall I speak forth beauty? How ought the soul of man to act in\nan emergency? What is the best solution of the great human problems of\nduty, love, and fate? The voices of Dante, Milton, Shakespeare,\nTennyson, and Browning sweep the soul upward to spiritual heights, and\nanswer some of the deepest questionings of the soul of man. And hence\nliterature is no longer merely a thing of vocabulary, of phrase, of\nrhythm, of assonance, of alliteration, or of metrical and philosophical\nform. It is a revelation of the progress of the soul, of its standards,\nof its triumphs, its defeats, and its desires. It is the unfolding of\none's intellectual helplessness before the unmoved, calm passing of\nyears; of one's emotional inadequacy without God for adjudicator. It is\na direct search for God. One finds wrapped within it the mystery,\naspiration, and spiritual passion of the soul.\n\nScience, no longer a dry assembling of facts and figures, is an\nincreasing revelation of the imagination, the exactness, the\nthoroughness, and the great progressive plans of God. Evolution has\nbecome a spiritual formula. The scientist looks out over the earth and\nsky and sun and star. Against his little years are meted out vast\nprehistoric spans; against his mastery of a few forms of life, stands\nLife itself. Back of all, there looms up the great Figure of the\nOriginator of life, and of the forms of life; the Maker and Ruler of\nthem all. Each scientific fact helps exegesis and evidence. Each new\naspiration after truth becomes a form of prayer.\n\nYes, the whole world is being subtly and powerfully drawn to the worship\nof the Christ. Never before was there so deep, genuine, and widespread a\nRevival of Religion. It has not come heralded with great outcries, with\nflame and wind, and revolution and upheaval; it has come as the great\nchanges that are most permanent come, in stillness and strength.\nThroughout the world there is being turned to the service of religion\nthe highest training, the most intellectual power. Wars are being\nwrought for freedom; the Church and the university are joining hands;\nthe rich and the poor are drawing near together for mutual help and\nunderstanding; industry is growing to be, not only a crude force, brutal\nand disregarding, but a high ministry to human needs; the home is\nbecoming more and more the guardian of faith and the shrine of peace;\nbusiness houses are taking upon them a religious significance; commerce\nand trade are perceiving ethical duties. Armies are marching in the\nname of Jehovah, and a great poet has this one message: \"Lest\nwe forget!\"\n\n7. Jesus calls us by the future of the race. Life proceeds to life.\nEternity is what is just before. Immortality is a native concept for the\nsoul. Beyond this hampered half-existence, the soul demands life,\nfreedom, growth, and power.\n\nWe stand between two worlds. Behind us is the engulfed Past, wherein\ngenerations vanish, as the wake of ships at sea. Before us is the\nFuture, in the dawn-mist of hovering glory, and surprise. Looking out\nover eternity, that billowy expanse, do we not see rising, clear though\nshadowy, a vast Permanence, Completion, Realization, in which the soul\nof man shall have endless progress and delight? This is the Promise held\nout by all the ages, and the future toward which all the thoughts and\ndreams of man converge. It is glorious to be a living soul, and to know\nthat this great race--life is yet to be!\n\nAt the threshold of each new century stands Jesus, star-encircled, with\na voice above the ages and a crown above the spheres,--Jesus, saying,\nFOLLOW ME!\n\n\n\n\nIII. PROCESSIONAL: THE CHURCH OF GOD\n\n     [AURELIA]\n\n     _The Church's one foundation\n       Is Jesus Christ her Lord;\n     She is His new creation\n       By water and the Word:\n     From heaven He came and sought her\n       To be His Holy Bride;\n     With His own blood He bought her\n       And for her life He died.\n\n     Though with a scornful wonder\n       Men see her sore opprest,\n     By schisms rent asunder,\n       By heresies distrest;\n     Yet saints their watch are keeping,\n       Their cry goes up, \"How long?\"\n     And soon the night of weeping\n       Shall be the morn of song.\n\n     'Mid toil and tribulation,\n       And tumult of her war,\n     She waits the consummation\n       Of peace for evermore;\n     Till with the vision glorious\n       Her longing eyes are blest,\n     And the great Church victorious\n       Shall be the Church at rest._\n\n     SAMUEL JOHN STONE\n\n\nFIRST: RECONSTRUCTION\n\nThe subject that is being carefully considered by many thinking men and\nwomen to-day is this: the place and prospects of the Christian Church.\nAll about us we hear the cry that the Church is declining, and may\neventually pass away; that it does not gain new members in proportion to\nits need, nor hold the attention and allegiance of those already\nenrolled. Are these things true? If so, how may better things be brought\nto pass? To share in the civilization that has come from nineteen\nhundred years of the work of the Church, and to be unwilling to lift a\npound's weight of the present burden, in order to pass on to others our\nprecious heritage, is certainly a selfish and unworthy course. It is\nbetter to ask, What is my work in the upbuilding of the Church? What can\nI do to further the Royal Progress of the Church of God?\n\nThe root-failure of the organized Church to-day is its failure to share\nin the growing life of the world. A growing life is one that is full of\nnew ideas, new experiences, new emotions, a new outlook over life--that\nworks in new ways, and that is full of seething and tumultuous energy,\nenthusiasm, and hope. If we look out over the colleges, business\nenterprises, periodicals, agriculture, manufacturing, and shipping of\nthe world, we find everywhere one story--growth, impetus, courage,\nresources, vigorous and bounding life. Beside these things the average\nchurch services to-day are both stupid and poky. The forces of religion\nare neither guided nor wielded well. There is in most churches, however\nwe may dislike to own the fact, a decrease of interest and proportionate\nmembership, a waning prestige, a general air of discouragement, and a\ntale of baffled efforts and of disappointed hopes.\n\nThe Church--and by this word I here mean the organized body of both\nclergymen and laymen--is meant to be the supreme spiritual leader of the\nworld. It is meant to possess vigor, decision, insight, hope, and\nintellectual power. But before it can accomplish its high and holy work,\na great reconstruction must begin. To help in this reconstruction, to\naid in vivifying, cooerdinating, and ruling the varied processes of\norganized religion, is your work and mine.\n\n1. The Church must rouse to a sense of its noble duties and exalted\npowers. We underrate the Church. We are looking elsewhere for our\nhighest ideals, instead of claiming from the Church that spiritual\nguidance and inspiration which should be its right to give. One of the\nthings that is a monumental astonishment to me, is that when we need\nsupplication, intercession, prayer for the averting of great personal or\nnational calamity, we flee to the Church, but we seldom think of the\nChurch when we need brains!\n\nThe Church should lead, and not follow, the great dreams of the world.\nIn the midst of our new national life we are sending all over the\ncountry for the best-trained help and thought in every department of\ngovernment influence and control. Our problems of the day are\npreeminently spiritual ones. Colonial control is not a question of\nmaterial ascendancy--it is a rule over the minds, hearts, and ideals of\nmen. Its moral significance is patent. We are called upon, not only to\nimport provisions, clothing, and household and industrial goods into our\nnew possessions; we are called upon to develop a higher sense of honor,\ntruth, honesty, and every-day morality. Scholars, working-men, business\nmen, farmers, and merchants are being consulted in regard to different\nphases of our national advance, and every idea which their insight and\nexperience furnish is seized upon. But who is consulting the Church in\nthese concerns, except in reference to mere technical points? Who is\nlooking to the intellectual, moral, and spiritual standards of the\nChurch for guidance? We are to-day ruled spiritually, as well as\nintellectually, by laymen, and in a way which is quite outside the\norganized work of the Church.\n\n2. The Church needs a more business-like organization and way of work.\nIt needs a more military spirit and discipline. The Church is diffuse\nand loosely strung. There are in the United States alone about two\nhundred and fifty-six kinds of religious bodies. There is no centralized\ninterest or work; there is no economic adjustment of funds; there is no\ninternal agreement as to practical methods. The result is a most\nwasteful expenditure of force. Movements are not only duplicated, but\nreproduced a hundred times in miniature, in one denomination after\nanother; special talent is restricted to a narrow field; buildings and\nchurch-plants are multiplied, but lie largely disused; sects and\ncommunities are at loggerheads on unessential points; all this--and the\nworld is not being saved! The Church fails to see openings for\naggressive work; it fails to seize strategic points; it does not carry a\nwell-knit local organization, with a husbanding of economic force; it\ndoes not front the world in dead-earnest; it is not proud and honorable\nin meeting its local debts; it loses progressive force, from lack of\nknowledge as to how to judge men, and train them, and set them to work.\n\nIt also lacks greatly in office-force and in supplies. The gospel itself\nis without price, but in the nature of things it cannot be proclaimed,\nnor church-work efficiently carried on, without financial outlay. There\nshould be a more adequate equipment for this work. All other enterprises\nneed, without question, stationery, stenographers, literature for\ndistribution, office-rooms, office-hours, and a general arrangement\nlooking toward enlargement and progress. A busy pastor should have an\noffice-equipment just as much as a business man, and it should be\nsupported, as a business office is, out of the funds of the business\norganization, _i.e._ the local church.\n\nThere should be, first of all, a united spirit, and a general\nreorganization throughout the whole of evangelical Christendom, not\nnecessarily destroying denominational lines, with a view to quick\nmobilization of energy in any direction most needed. What would a\ngeneral do, who, in looking over his troops, should find two hundred and\nfifty-six provincial armies, not at ease or at peace with each other,\nand yet expected to make war upon a common foe? Shall we not endeavor to\nshare in some broadly planned, magnificently executed scheme of\nworld-advance?\n\nThe Church has reached a point where a vast constructive work is to be\ndone. Its scattered parts must be knit into a powerful and aggressive\nwhole, to turn a solid front upon the evil of the world. The times are\nripe for a successor of Peter the Hermit, of Luther, Knox, Calvin,\nZwingli, Savonarola, Whitefield, Finney, Moody. Whether a great\npreacher, theologian, or evangelist, he will certainly be a business\nman, a man of vast energy and executive capacity, who shall perform this\nmiracle of organization of which many dream, and who shall set the\nprogress of the Church for a full century to come!\n\nThis united spirit should prevail, not only through the smaller bodies,\nbut between the Roman Catholic and Protestant communions. There has been\na distinct division between these two bodies, much mutual suspicion,\njealousy, and antagonism: it is only quite lately that Protestant and\nCatholic leaders have been willing to work amicably together for great\ncommon causes.\n\nA new situation has arisen. In our new possessions we are confronted\nwith a large population who, whatever may be the reason, are\nunquestionably not, as a whole, progressive, enlightened, educated, or\nhighly moral. The problem now is, not for Catholic and Protestant to\nwaste energy and spiritual strength in contending for mastery over each\nother, but for them to unite in changing and bettering the condition of\nour island peoples. What is past is past. Our present duty is to bring\npeace, industry, intelligence, high ideals, and spiritual living to our\nnew countrymen. This is a work to fill the hands and heart of both\nchurches, and perhaps, in a common task, each may learn to understand\nand regard the other as those should understand and regard each other\nwho have one Lord, one hope, one heaven.\n\n3. The Church needs stronger and more gifted leaders. In every business\nor intellectual enterprise to-day, there is an effort to place at the\nhead of each organization the most powerful and resourceful man whose\nservices can be obtained. Nothing in this age works, or is expected to\nwork, without the leadership of brains. A primary step, in a\nfar-reaching ecclesiastical policy, is to endeavor to draw into both\nministry and membership the most active and intellectual class. All\nearnest souls can work, but not all can work equally effectively.\nParticularly in the ministry, north, south, east, and west, men are\nneeded who are really _men_. This does not necessarily mean the men with\nthe longest string of academic degrees, the men who can write the best\npoems or make the best speeches on public occasions; it means the\nthinking men who are brave, talented, spiritual, and warm-hearted.\n\nIn the Report of one of the missionary Boards, I have recently read the\nfollowing stirring words. They refer to the work of missionaries in the\nfar north, one of whom has lately travelled a thousand miles over the\nsnow in a dog-sled: \"He who follows that mining crowd must be more than\nthe minister, who would do well for towns in the west or elsewhere in\nAlaska. He must be a man who, when night overtakes him, will be thankful\nif he can find a bunk and a plate in a miner's cabin; he must travel\nmuch, and therefore cannot be cumbered with extra trappings--must dress\nas the miners do, and accept their food and fare. He must be no less in\nearnest in his search for souls than they in search for gold. He must be\nso 'furnished' that, without recourse to books or study-table, he can\nminister acceptably to men who under the guise of a miner's garb hide\nthe social and mental culture of life in Eastern colleges and\nprofessional days.\"\n\nIt is far from that land of frost and snow to the beautiful island of\nPorto Rico, washed by tropical seas, through the streets of whose\ncapital there passes every day the carriage of the Governor, with its\nwhite-covered upholstery and its livery of white. But I add this word:\nThe missionary sent to Porto Rico, be he Catholic or Protestant, must be\na man who can stand among statesmen and society men and women, as well\nas one who can live and work among the humblest folk who lodge in\nleaf-thatched huts along the roadside or far on lonely hills.\nRepresentative men of ability, health, culture, and courage are being\nchosen to carry on governmental work: it is idle to send provincial men\nto the Church. What is locally true of the Church in Porto Rico is\nfundamentally true all over the world, at home and abroad. Each\nministerial post to-day requires an imperial man. Not every post\nrequires the same sort of man, either in regard to general heredity or\neducation. Men are needed of the Peter-type, of the John-type, of the\nPaul-type; it suffices that, they be men of unusual power, and well\nfitted to their individual work.\n\n4. The Church needs a better system for the proper placing of men. No\nphase of the world's work can be carried on merely and simply because a\nman is pious. In every phase of life, there is a constant shifting of\nmen according to temperament, ability, and general influence and power.\nIn the Church we must have a quick and decisive recognition of a man's\nability, and he must be set where that talent can work easily and\neffectively. Churches are not all alike. There are no two alike. When we\nthink of it, what a ghoulish business \"candidating\" is! No scheme for\nthe right placing of men can be devised which does not place a great\ndeal of power in the hand of a few leading men. This power may be\nabused, but ought not to be, if it were really looked upon as under\ndivine direction and inspiration. Cannot a great leader be inspired to\nthe choice of a man, as well as a great author to the choice of a word,\na rhyme? Comparatively few men thoroughly understand how to rate other\nmen, and to these few men, as in all other great enterprises, must be\ngiven the power and authority to select and adjust. By this I do not\nmean that a set of ecclesiastics will alone be adequate. Ecclesiastical\nvision, like all other highly specialized vision, is partial, and does\nnot always see quite straight. There should also be called into play the\nbusiness ability and discernment of men of large business interests or\nadministrative gifts. Sooner or later the various religious\norganizations will have to meet, in some better way than any thus far\nformulated, this growing need.\n\n5. We need a release of pressure on the abler men. Many a minister\nto-day is a sort of community lackey. What other men are frankly too\nbusy to do, he is supposed to be cheerfully ready to do. The list of odd\njobs which fall to his lot would be ridiculous, were not their influence\nupon his life and work so retrogressive and so sad. He lives to serve\nothers, but this vow of service is greatly imposed upon. If he is to\nlead in intellectual and spiritual matters, he must be given fewer\nerrands to run, the financial burden of his church must be taken\nabsolutely from his shoulders, he must have a suitable salary, and his\ntime must be at least as carefully guarded as that of the average man.\nSome calls he is bound to obey, at whatever cost of time or\nstrength,--illness, certain public duties, and real spiritual\nneeds,--but his life must not be at the mercy of cranks, or of idle\npersons' whims.\n\n6. We need a reorganization of preaching traditions. It is a tradition\nthat a minister must, in general, preach two set sermons every week,\ngive one informal week-day lecture, and be prepared to deliver, at any\nmoment, funeral addresses, anniversary speeches, \"remarks,\" or to\nperform other utterly impossible intellectual feats. Anyone who writes,\nor who speaks in public, knows that the preparation of a half-hour\naddress which is worth anything requires a great deal of time. It\ncannot ordinarily be \"tossed off,\" and help men's souls. Only an\noccasional inspiration, the result of a lifetime of thought and\nexperience, is born in this sudden way. Usually excellence is the result\nof long and careful labor. The way to help this would seem to be a\nconstant interchange of preachers, not only in one denomination, but\namong the various denominations, so that a really fine sermon would be\nheard by many people, and fewer sermons would require to be written.\nThis is easily done in a large city or its vicinity. What congregations\nneed most is not altogether formal sermons, but thoughtful, helpful\ntalks containing a fresh, uplifting, and spiritual outlook over life,\nwith a practical bearing on the occasions and duties of life. The work\nof both Frederick Robertson and Horace Bushnell has this direct and\nvital tone.\n\nMinisters must study more. If they are freed from many tasks now put\nupon them, it is not unreasonable to ask that this time be put on more\ncareful thinking. Too many a minister of to-day is, intellectually,\nsomething of a flibbertigibbet. His sermons do not take hold, because\nthey have not the roots to take hold with. How many ministers possess,\nfor instance, a scholarly knowledge of human nature or of the deeper\naspects of redemption? Yet these things he ought to know. There is a\nlarge amount of intensely interesting, though spiritually undigested,\nmaterial for a minister in a book like William James's _Varieties of\nReligious Experience_.\n\n7. Greater care must be taken of the rural church. Any one interested in\na great ecclesiastical polity must surely recognize the ultimate\npossibilities of our rural regions. Here are growing up the leading men\nand women of to-morrow. Ideals and inspirations set upon their hearts\nwill bear fruit a thousand-fold. Hence there should be a definite\narrangement by which a certain portion of the preaching time of the\nreally able preachers shall be placed each year in some small and remote\nplace. Several scattered country churches might unite for these\nservices. Let such a man also make helpful suggestions for neighborhood\nsocial and intellectual life. While he is in the village, let the\ncountry pastor go to town, browse in libraries, art-collections, hear\nmusic, and get a general quickening of interest and inspiration. Let\neach compare notes with the other. They will both gain by this\ninterchange.\n\n8. There is too little recognition of individual talent in the Church.\nToo few workers are set at work which they know how to do, and the\nuntaught rush at tasks which angels fear to touch. We have myriads of\nSabbath-school teachers, but how many men or women really know how to\nteach a little child? The man is asked to speak or pray in\nprayer-meeting, who cannot possibly do it well, but no notice is taken\nof the fact that he thoroughly understands public accounts. A man is\nasked to subscribe ten dollars to a church affair, who cannot afford it,\nbut his spiritual insight might save the impending church quarrel.\nPeople come and go in the churches, and many, I am convinced, drift away\nbecause they are never asked for anything but money for the support and\ninterest of the Church. In no other sort of organization is this true.\nEven in the summer camp or mountain hotel or Atlantic liner, when any\npastime or entertainment is suggested, the first thing to discover is,\nWhat can each one _do_? One, who has the gift of organization and\nmanagement, \"gets it up\"; one sings; one reads or recites; one writes a\nbright bit of verse; another smooths out rising jealousies, or bridges,\nby a little tact, the abyss of caste. Why do we hide so many pretty\ntalents under a bushel, when the church-door swings behind us? Why do we\nsubstitute such strange and foolish tasks, particularly for women? What\nwould leading lawyers and doctors do, I wonder, if they were asked, as\nbusy women often have been, to spend a precious morning in a church-room\nsorting cast-off clothes?\n\nIn every church, large or small, there are both men and women who are\ntalented in a special way; who could bring gifts of training and\nexperience to bear upon the problems and opportunities of the Church.\nTell me, in prayer or speech-making, formal or social occasion, pastor\nor people, do we often bring our very deepest, tenderest, most inspiring\nemotional or intellectual life? It is not a whit more spiritual to be\nstupid than to be bright. This is what our church-meetings should\nbe--not a formal and very dull round of prayers and set remarks, more or\nless pointless; they ought to be a yielding-up of our heart's best life\nto others.\n\n9. We need, as a Church, a deeper spiritual life. We need the Power of\nthe Holy Ghost. In spite of all the sorrow of the world, sorrow both of\na personal nature and that which touches whole communities, there is\nonly one real burden upon the heart of earnest men and women: it is our\nown inadequate representation of Christianity,--the disheartening\ndifference between what we practise and what we profess. When the Church\nof God is in reality a powerful and hard-working body of sincere,\nhonest, and loving people, the world will soon be saved!\n\n\nSECOND: ADHERENCE\n\nBy the question, Why join the Church?--I do not mean alone, Why add my\nname to a church-roll? I mean, Why give myself, my powers, my education,\nmy love, my loyalty, to advance the progress of the Church?\n\nThere is nothing we resent more than a waste of ourselves. To attract\nour service, there must be in the Church an inner vitality, a moving\nand spiritual fire.\n\n1. The Church embodies the spiritual dreams of the world. Man does not\nlive by bread alone; he lives by imagination, and by religious powers.\nIn the Church of God, the spiritual imagination of man reached its\nhighest field of energy, and has brought forth its most triumphant\nworks. The great art of the world has centred about the Christian\nChurch--its architecture and much of its noblest speech. Imagine a world\nin which every work which was inspired by the Church, or by the concepts\nof religion embodied in it, should be left out. What would we then lack?\nWe would lack the greatest works of Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian,\nFrancesca, Botticelli, Murillo; we would not see the cathedrals of\nMilan, Strasburg, or Cologne; we would never read the poems of Caedmon,\nMilton, or Dante. The hamlet would be without a spire; philanthropy\nwould be almost unknown; there would be neither night-watch nor\nmorning-watch of united prayer. We should have no processional of\nmillions churchward on the Lord's Day, no hymns to stir our souls to joy\nand praise, no anthems or oratorios, no ministers, no ecclesiastical\ncourts and assemblies, no church conventions, no church-schools,\nreligious societies, nor religious press. All these works and\ninstitutions proclaim the glory of belief, and hand down the religious\ntraditions and the spiritual aspirations of the generations of men.\nShall we let others share in the mystery and triumph while we stand\napart, silent, unapproving, and alone?\n\nThe dreams of the Church are high and holy. There is the dream of\nFreedom, of the Freedom of the Soul. It is an inspiring thought this,\nthe essential democracy of the race. We do not find intellectual\nequality of souls. We see each man or woman differently circumstanced,\ndifferently gifted, differently trained. Yet each may say, I am\nspiritually free! To me also is given the opportunity of development, of\nmajesty of character, of high service. The soul is the thrall of none;\nnothing can bind it to spiritual serfdom.\n\nNext, there is the dream of Allegiance. Some one has well said: \"Wouldst\nthou live a great life? Ally thyself with a great cause.\" Allegiance is\ndevotion of the whole of ourselves to a leader, a cause. We can no more\ngo through the world without allying ourselves to something than we can\ngo through it and live nowhere. If the object of our allegiance be a\nhigh one, if the ideal be a grand one, our lives are in a constant\nprocess of development toward that height, that grandeur. Each act of\nfaith becomes an impetus to progress. We are daily enriched by the\nexperience of mere obedience. To obey and follow are acts in the\nuniversal process.\n\nIf, on the other hand, we ally ourselves to that which is lower than\nourselves, by the very act we are dragged down. No one can remain upon\neven his own level, who is in obedience and devotion to that which is\nbelow him. Allegiance to a Higher is one of the trumpet-calls of the\nworld. It has been the rally of all armies, of all legions, of all\ncrusades. The great commander is, by his very position, a grouper of\nother men, the ruler of their thoughts, their deeds, their dreams. His\npower to call and to sway is beyond his own ideas of it. How otherwise\ncould it be that out of one century one heart calls to another--out of\none age, proceeds the answer to the cry of ages gone?\n\nThe lover of music to-day allies himself to Bach, to Haydn, to Mozart,\nto Wagner, by his appreciation, his sympathy, his understanding of what\nthey have done. He acknowledges their control of his musical self by his\nefforts to interpret their work to others, and to create new works which\nshall be inspired by their ideals. Thus he acknowledges their control of\nhis own powers. Such control over the spirit of man is that of the\nChurch over the social body; it stirs the spiritual aspiration of man,\nit directs his ambition. It fixes upon a standard, the Cross; upon a\nHero, the Christ, and reaches unto all the world its arm of power,\ndrawing unto itself the loyalty, the faith, the affection, and the royal\nservice of successive generations of mankind.\n\nThe dream of Redemption. It is not technical creeds for which the\nChurch as a whole stands, but for certain vital principles which concern\nthe life of the soul, and its relation to God and man. Virtue has always\nbeen a dream of the heart. But how inaccessible is virtue, with a past\nof unforgiven sin! The height of our ideal of redemption is conditioned\nupon the depth of our realization of sin. To the shallow, redemption is\nan easy-going process, a way of healing the scratches which the world\nmakes. To the deep and serious-minded, redemption involves the\nregeneration of the race. Only the ransomed can truly work, love,\nor praise!\n\nThere is one sorrow which God never calls us to--the sorrow of a wasted\nlife. By redemption, the Church reveals not only a saving from\nrebellion, unbelief, and crime, but redemption from sloth, from\nindifference, from lack of purpose, and from low aims. Redemption looms\nup as the great economic force of Time--that which inspires and\npreserves our powers, directs our energies, creates opportunity, brings\nto pass our most high and holy desires, and fills life with satisfying\nand abiding things.\n\nBeauty, harmony, and affection are the natural laws of the moral world.\nThere is no despair where there has been no disobedience. _Christus\nSalvator_ stands out before the world in majesty and power. Virtue is\nenthroned in a universe which is beneficent.\n\nThe dream of Fellowship. The Church is the great social body. We can\nnever live our best life in the world, and stand outside the Church.\nThere is something vital in personal contact, and in social affiliation.\nIt strengthens the best and otherwise most complete work. The Christian\nChurch is a body of allies, whose work is the upbuilding of the kingdom\nof God. We do not realize how great a bond this is. We have our own\nchurch centre, our own denomination, our own local interests. But by and\nby a great occasion arises--a revival which sweeps the country, a\nreunion of two long-divided parties, an Ecumenical Council, a Chinese\npersecution--and suddenly there arises before the mind's eye a glimpse\nof that Church which girdles the world, whose emissaries are in every\ncountry, whose voices speak in every tongue. We perceive that\neverywhere are\n\n          \"_Swelling hills and spacious plains\n     Besprent from shore to shore with steeple-towers,\n     And spires whose silent finger points to heaven_.\"\n\nSays Wordsworth also:\n\n     \"_They dreamt not of a perishable home,\n        Who thus could build_.\"\n\nMany an ideal state has been thought out, in which fellowship should be\nthe root of social progress. But in what state is the proffered\nfellowship like that of the communion of saints? Each has his share of\nwork and dreams; each has his endowment of talent and of opportunity;\neach has his aspirations and supreme hope. The joys of one are the joys\nof all. The sorrows of one are the sorrows of all. The triumphs of one\nare the triumphs of all. The World-burden is the task set to be removed.\nThe World-upbuilding in love, joy, peace, and truth is the final\nendeavor. This community of interest is the strongest coalition the\nworld has yet known.\n\nThere are those who say, I prefer to worship by myself! One might as\nwell say, I prefer to fight in battle by myself! There is a time for\npersonal worship, and there is a time for social worship. Alone, the\nheart meets God. Alone, its prayers for individual needs and longings\nare offered up. Alone, it asks for blessings on the individual life and\nwork. But the personal life is only a fragmentary part of the life\nuniversal. Above the ages rings an Over-song of praise. From shrines and\ncathedrals, from chapels, churches, tents, and caves, there arises, day\nafter day, this incense of united prayer, from a vast and\nheaven-uplifted throng! Each of us would say, Canopied under\nworld-skies, I, too, would join this chorus of adoring love!\n\nThe dream of Permanence. The immortality of the Church is akin to the\nimmortality of the soul. It is a connection which is never severed. When\nwe enter the visible body of the Church on earth, we connect ourselves\nwith the invisible hosts of the Church on high. We enter a company\nwhich shall never be disbanded nor dismayed. Something subtle and\neternal seems to lay hold of our spirits, and to lift them even to God's\nThrone. For this Time has been, and for this Time now is: to present\nspotless before Him the innumerable company of the redeemed, the\nlion-hearted who, armed by faith and shod with fire, in robes of azure\nand with songs of praise, shall stand before Him even for evermore!\n\n2. The Church is the centre of a great circle of remembrance. One of\nConstable's famous paintings represents the Cathedral of Salisbury\noutlined against a storm-swept sky, with a lovely rainbow arched beyond\nit. So stands the Church athwart the landscape of our lives. In each\ncommunity the church is like a living thing! How every stone grows\nsignificant and dear! How the lights and shadows of its arches, the dim,\nfaint-tinted windows, the carvings and tracings, the atmosphere and\ncoloring, all sink into the heart, and make a background for memories\nthat never pass away! Who ever forgets the tones of the old organ, the\nvoice of the choir, the accent, look, and bearing of one's early pastor,\nthe rustle of the leaves without the window, the rush of the fresh\nsummer air, the soft falling of the rain?\n\nThe path to the church is worn by the feet of generations. Thither the\naged go up, and thither the laughing, romping children. Weary men and\nwomen bear their burdens thither; triumphant souls bring shining faces\nand uplifted brows; love and dreams cluster round the church, and the\nlife of the soul, silent and hidden, is subtly acted upon by persuasions\nand convictions that rule the heart amid the fiercest storms and\ntemptations of the world. The church is a sanctuary and shield; it is an\nemblem of strength and peace. Three angels stand before its altar: Life,\nLove, Death! Hither is brought the babe for the christening, hither\ncomes the wedding procession, and here are laid, with farewell tears,\nthe quiet dead. Day by day within that church, as one grows to manhood\nand womanhood, one enters into race-experiences, and feels, however\nvaguely, that the Holy Spirit abides within them all.\n\n3. The Church affords the best outlet for moral activity. Where shall we\nput our moral powers? In what work shall they centre? From what point\nshall they diverge? Scattered action is irresolute; it is the\ncentripetal powers that count.\n\nThe Church stands ready to engage, to the full, the moral powers of man.\nIt can rightly distribute the spiritual vitality of the world. It rouses\nthe moral emotions and affections, and gives scope for contrition,\nadoration, and thanksgiving,--the Trisagion of the heart.\n\nIn the press and stir of life we sometimes forget that the highest\nemotions of which we are capable are those of joy, praise, and prayer.\nJoy is a heavenward uplift of life--deep happiness of spirit. Praise is\nan appreciation of the greatness and mercy of the Infinite. Worship is\nthe outpouring of the whole nature, an ascription of blessing, glory,\nhonor, and power and majesty to God. It flows from the religious\nimagination, and is the supreme offering of the intellectual as well as\nof the emotional life.\n\nThe Church is a body ministrant: it has received the accolade of\nspiritual service. It stands among the world's forces, as one of giving,\nnot of gain. It holds within its scope both a teaching and a training\npower. It is the school of the soul, the illuminator of the meaning and\ndiscipline of life. Abelard is said to have attracted thirty thousand\nstudents to Paris by his teaching. But the Church to-day calls into its\nassemblies fully one-third of the millions of the world. They are held\nby its tenets, guided by its ideals, thrilled by its hopes, and set to\nits works of charity and mercy. The highest philanthropy is but a\nscientific renewal and adaptation of work which has had its start,\nprimarily, in the Christian Church. Wealth is its vicegerent, and from\nthe adherents to the Church fall largely the contributions to great\nphilanthropic causes.\n\nTake the work of Missions alone: Has there ever before been a body which\nattempted to bring the whole world into its fellowship, to make known\neverywhere its ideals, and to share with all living a spiritual\ninheritance? \"The Evangelization of the World by this Generation\" is\none of the most sublime thoughts which has come to the race.\n\n4. There is a large amount of ability in the world which the Church\nneeds, but which has not yet been thoroughly enlisted in church service.\nTake business energy, executive ability. It is a common saying, that\nbusiness men are not interested in the Church, and do not work well in\nit. Why? Because there is not yet in the Church enough of the active and\neconomic spirit to make a business man feel at home in it, or approve of\nits ways of work.\n\nThis weak spot in the Church, which business men mock at, or fret at,\nexactly reveals the work that is waiting for business men to do.\nBusiness to-day takes intellectual grasp and insight--promptness,\nenergy, enterprise, and common-sense. These qualities are needed at once\nin the conduct of the Church.\n\nA second class greatly needed by the Church is the university-bred. Many\ncollege graduates are church-members--some are even active workers. But\nuntil lately the universities as a whole have stood rather indifferently\napart from the Church. They have somewhat indulgently regarded it as one\nmore historic institution for preserving myth and legend. To them the\nChrist-life has meant little more than the Beowa-myth, the Arthur-saga,\nthe Nibelungen cycle, the Homeric stories, the Thor-and-Odin tales!\nDruids, fire-worshippers, moon-dancers, and Christian communicants have\nbeen comparatively studied, with a view to understanding the\nrace-progress in rite and religious form.\n\nThis spirit is changing. The most remarkable aspect of the intellectual\nlife of to-day is the rise of faith in the universities. Like the\nincoming of a great tidal wave at sea is the wave of spiritual insight\nand religious aspiration that is rolling over the colleges of our land.\n\nThe whole intellectual structure of the Church is approaching\nreconstruction--its doctrines, creeds, tenets. This reconstruction\ncannot possibly be effected by schools of theology alone. At every point\nthe theologian needs assistance from the man of science. Philosophy,\npsychology, ethics, history, literature, sociology, language, natural\nscience, and archaeology are all bound up in an old creed and must be\nlooked into, ere a new statement can take form. Their data must be known\nat first-hand. Hence there is no intellectual specialty which may not be\nmade invaluable to the Church.\n\nToo often religion has been a matter of hearsay or dogma. A bitter\nconflict has always raged between theology and the latest word of\nscience. The Church cannot afford to be without the scientific thinkers\nof the race. The time has come when there is everywhere heard the call\nof Jesus to men of mind.\n\nWhat work awaits the university man or woman? It is to help free the\nChurch from traditions and superstitions which scholarship cannot\nuphold. It is to throw fresh vigor and intellectual vitality into the\nservices of the Church. It is to build up a hymnology which shall be\nnoble and poetic in expression; it is to contribute a great religious\nliterature to the world. It is the work of educated men and women to add\ntheir insight, their zeal for truth, their scholarship, their training\nand ideals to the Christian community: to sweep thought and practice out\nof ancient ruts, to clarify the spiritual vision of the world, and to\npresent new aspects of truth and new goals of human endeavor! Let\nResearch join hands with Prayer.\n\nA third class which the Church needs to-day is that of the working-man.\nThe hand of the working-man is the hand that has really moulded history.\nWorking-men lead a brave and self-sacrificing life. From their toil come\nthe necessaries and many of the comforts of the race. The man of labor\nknows the root-problems of the industrial world. While all his industry\nand skill, all his courage, heroism, and strong-armed life are so\nlargely alienated from the Church, the Church is deprived of one of the\nfundamental sources of inspiration and growth. The tree of progress can\nnever grow, except it has labor-roots. It is absolutely essential for\nthe health of the Church that every form of human energy be represented.\n\nSuppose that by some great revival a very large number of working men\nand women could suddenly be added to the membership of the Church. What\nwould happen? Would there not be at once a return to more simplicity of\nlife? There are two currents at work always in society--emulation and\nsympathy. Rightly used, each is for the social good. If all classes of\nmen and women worked side by side in the Church, many great social\ndifferences would become adjusted.\n\n5. It holds sway over the fortunes of the home. Where, outside of the\nChurch, will you find the ideal conception of marriage, and the really\nunited and happy home? The Church makes for domestic happiness, because\nit goes straight to the roots of life and plants happiness where\nhappiness alone can grow. More and more the Church is lifting the\nstandards of a noble, proud, pure, and rejoicing married life. Its ideal\nof human love is sacred, because founded on the deeper love of the soul\nin God. The Church is drawing hosts of young people under the shelter of\nits teaching, and is placing before men and women ideals which cannot\nfail to make their mark upon the social standards of the times. It\nstands for purity, for patience, for tenderness, for the love of little\nchildren, for united education and endeavor, for mutual hopes and\ndreams, for large public service.\n\n6. It is the militant force of time. We speak of the Church militant,\nand of the Church triumphant. For us, to-day, the Church militant.\nTo-morrow, triumph comes. Armies have been, and armies shall be, but the\nhosts of this world fight against material foes, and largely for\nmaterial ends. It is the glory of the Church militant that its conquests\nare spiritual and its victories are eternal. Its fight is chiefly\nagainst the inner, not the outer foe--against sin and wrong-doing,\nimpatience, strife, anger, clamor, meanness, evil-speaking, wrath. It is\nthe foe of tyranny and its heel is upon the head of the oppressor and\nthe avenger. Its banner flies over every country and has been carried\nthrough tribulation, through sorrow, through danger, and through death\nto the remotest parts of the yet-known world. Its troops are legion,\nmarching from the far distances of the past, and extending out to the\nfar confines of the eternal years.\n\n7. It is the ascendant force of the future. Rightly conducted, it will\nsurely absorb the vigor of the world. To stand apart from it is to be\nout of step with the march of nations. The processional of progress\nto-day is the processional of the historic influence of the Church. What\nforce has there been in time gone by, which has lived and so greatly\ngrown for nineteen hundred years? Nations have risen, and nations have\ndecayed. States, once prominent, have passed into the oblivion of the\nyears. Plato and Pericles, Socrates and Sophocles, Philip and Alexander,\nthe Caesars, the Georges, and the Louis have passed away. Their\npolitics have passed from our following; their empires are no more. But\nthrough these centuries of change, the Church of God has risen stronger,\nmore powerful year by year; stretching its arm out to the uttermost\nparts of the earth; levying tribute on the islands of the sea; enlisting\nall ages and conditions, and looking out over coming generations--not as\na waning, but as a growing and ever-increasing power. Think you that\nsuch a Church can die? Think you that any spiritual power aloof from\nthis Church can be as efficient as if it were allied with it?\n\nThese, you say, are the reasons why one's allegiance should be given to\nthe Christian Church. Let us now look back over the processional as it\nmarches across the dim years. Saints, martyrs, confessors, evangelists,\nand singing children have joined its historic train. Is there any other\nprocessional in the world's history which, numbering such millions and\nmillions, began with only one? When the Christ enters the arena of\nhistory, He comes as one to lead myriad deep-lived souls! Next, there\nfollow twelve. They, two by two, take up the marching line. Think of\ntheir deeds and influence, of their inspiring power! What would have\nbeen the record of those obscure fishermen of Galilee and of their\nsimple friends, had they refused to ally themselves with the leader who\ncalled for their allegiance and their obedient love?\n\nNext follow the early disciples. Tried by scourging, by stripes, by\npoverty, by imprisonment, by all manner of danger and trial, they yet\nremain true. Then follow the prophets, those whose clear vision looks\nout on things unknown and things unseen. To the prophet is intrusted the\nministry of hope and inspiration. Then follow the martyrs who yield life\nfor the cause they profess. In torture at the stake, and on the cross,\nby fire and by sword, they show forth an unshaken and undying faith.\nThen follow matrons and virgins, babes and children, reformers and\nmediaeval saints with a convoy of angels, singing as they march. These\nare the Church triumphant, the Church above. But to-day we have among us\nthe Church militant--the long processional of congregations, elders,\ndeacons, members, ministers and missionaries, young people, and workers\nin every phase of enterprise and reform. These all communicant on earth\nare the Church militant, whose work is to keep alive the traditions of\nthe past and to march onward to an endless victory and to an unceasing\npraise. Who, looking upon that processional, filing through the ages of\nthe years of man, would say that there may be a parliament of religions?\nA parliament of boasts and pomps, of good precepts and queries, of\nmisuses and half-truths, of superstitions and infinite idolatries, no\ndoubt; but there is but one religion, though it be perverted in many\nways and rightly revealed at divers times; and there is but one God,\ninfinite, true, holy, just, loving, and eternal. Where now are the gods\nof Hamath and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Bow thy head,\nO Buddha! and do thou, O Zoroaster! hang thy head. Isis and Osiris grow\ndim; Jove nods in heaven; the pipe of Pan is dumb; Thor is silent in the\nnorthern Aurora; the tree of Igdrasil waves in midnight; Confucius is\npale; Muhammad is dust. Darkness is over the skirts of the gods of the\npast--gloom receives them, Erebus holds outstretched arms. But the Lord\nGod, Jehovah, the Ancient of Days, encanopied in space and glory, leads\nonward to the end of years His people in a mighty train, to a rule and\nkingdom which shall know no end. May thou and I, dear friend-soul, in\nwhatsoever land thou be, may thou and I be numbered in that throng!\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE WORLD-MARCH: OF KINGS\n\n     [DIE WACHT AM RHEIN]\n\n     _Jesus shall reign where'er the sun\n     Doth his successive journeys run;\n     His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,\n     Till moons shall wax and wane no more.\n\n     People and realms of every tongue\n     Dwell on His love with sweetest song;\n     And infant voices shall proclaim\n     Their early blessings on His Name.\n\n     Blessings abound where'er He reigns;\n     The prisoner leaps to lose his chains,\n     The weary find eternal rest,\n     And all the sons of want are blest.\n\n     Let every creature rise and bring\n     Peculiar honors to our King;\n     Angels descend with songs again,\n     And earth repeat the loud Amen_.\n\n     ISAAC WATTS\n\nThe elemental force of some men is appalling. They lift their\neyes--thrones tremble; they wave a hand--empires rise or fall. It comes\nover the heart of many a man at times, Here am I, running my little\noffice, shop, factory, fire-engine, or professional circuit, with no\ninfluence that I can see, beyond my borough or my barn-yard. But in the\nworld there are other men, no taller than I, no older than I--men born\nwithin a stone's throw of where I was born--whose hand is on the fate of\nnations, and whose decrees are universal law!\n\nIt is deeply impressive, the way in which one man, born not above\nmyriads of his fellows, begins to rise until by and by he stands head\nand shoulders above his generation! What is the inner vitality which\npresses him upward? What is this hidden difference in men by which one\nremains in the by-eddies of life, and another sweeps out on the crest of\nthe rising tide of history?\n\nMuch of it is in the man himself. To be kingly is inborn. There is the\nnature that refuses to be shut up to the petty, that will not content\nitself with one street or town, that steps out into life from childhood\nwith the step of the conqueror, and walks among us; one who was born a\nking. To be a king, one must have the powers of organization,\ncombination, discipline, direction, statesmanship. These qualities\nenlarge as one passes from the particular to the general, from the\npersonal to the range of natural forces, emergencies, and wide pursuits.\n\nDominion is an inherent right of the soul. In all our hearts, did we but\nlisten and understand, there are adumbrations of kingly ancestors, and\nthe latent stirrings of kingly powers.\n\nWhich of us would want to be born at all, if we should be told in\nadvance, You shall never control anything? You shall never have the\nslightest chance of self-assertion, of impressing your own individuality\nupon the world? One might as well be born without hands or feet!\n\nKingship involves ascendancy and authority. Both are truly gained, not\nby chicanery, but by personal force. There is a natural gift of\nleadership, which is strengthened by endurance, perseverance, and\nceaseless hard work.\n\nKingship also involves a larger vision. One man looks at his\nshoe-strings; another man looks at the stars. The first step toward rule\nis to find a point of view from which one can look widely out over the\nrace. This is the primary value of education: it is not that books are\nimportant, but that men are--the men who have swayed history--and books\ntell of such men. Not the library is inspirational, but the life-spirit\nof mankind, bound up in even dusty papyrus-rolls, or set on\nclay-tablets of four thousand years ago. He who would serve his times\npolitically must first understand, so far as may be, all times.\n\nAnother basis of supremacy is conviction. Leadership belongs to those\nwho believe. The man who has a definite policy to propose, and a\ndefinite way of working for it, soon outstrips the man who is just\nlooking about.\n\nKingship involves an iron will. An iron will does not imply necessarily\nugliness of temper, obstinacy, or pig-headedness. It is simply a\nstraight-forward, dauntless, and invincible way of doing things. What I\nsay, you must do, is back of all successful leadership, whether in the\nhome or in the world-arena. The man who is master of the obedience of\nhis child, or of his fellows, is master of their fate. We are all at the\nmercy of the strong-willed.\n\nGrowth is development in right assertion; it is the assumption of\nlegitimate responsibility and command. To be lowly of heart does not\nmean to be inefficient; to be humble does not necessarily mean to be\nobscure. Luther and Lincoln were both of a childlike humility of heart.\n\nWhat Christianity has not emphasized in the past, but what it must now\nbegin to emphasize, is the reality of dominion--its value, and its\nrelation to the kingdom of God. For centuries, religion has too often\nbeen thought of, too often spoken of, as if it were the last resource of\nthe heart, A brilliant young professor of psychology not long ago\nreferred to religion as something to flee to, by those who were\ndisappointed in love! We have spoken so much of \"giving up,\" that the\nChristian life has wrongly seemed to mean the giving-up of one's\nindividuality, interests, powers. As well might we expert the deep sea\nto give up its rolling tides, or the air to give up its four winds, as\nto expect the heart of man to part with its human hopes!\n\nThis is not a right interpretation of life. When Nature plants an oak in\nthe forest, she does not say, Be a lichen, an _Eozooen canadense_, a\nsmall ground-creeping thing! She says, Grow! Become a tall, strong,\nmountain tree! When we hold our baby in our arms, we do not say, My\nchild, be good for nothing! Neither does God say, Be nothing, do\nnothing! Just exist as humbly and meekly as you can! He says, \"Quit you\nlike men!\"\n\nEach of us is born for a sceptre and a crown. It gives a strange new\nthrill to life, to realize that we may be just as ambitious as we\nplease, that we may long earnestly for high things, and work for them,\nif our inmost desire is not for self but for God. This new idea of\nambition should be at the root of education and of religious teaching.\nPiety is not a namby-pamby sentiment; it is a great intellectual force.\nDesire is architectural: our dreams should be of prestige and power.\nTrue ambition is the reaching-out of the soul toward preordained\nthings. What else is the meaning of our love for excellence, our\ninsatiable yearning for perfection? \"What is excellent,\" says Emerson,\n\"is permanent.\" To excel in any work is to combine in that work the most\nenduring qualities of human labor; to excel in any place is to shine\nforth with the great qualities of the race. Hence, ambition has a\nrightful place.\n\nThe power of a king is the power of control. All about us are moving the\ngreat forces of the universe--physical, intellectual, moral, spiritual.\nWhat we can do with them is a test of our power. Life is in many ways a\nmajestic trial of one's power to command.\n\nThree men buy adjoining tracts of land. One man mines coal upon his\nacres. He amasses wealth and influence because he is in control of the\nCarboniferous age and the human need of light and heat. The second man\ntills his ground and raises wheat and corn. He is in command of living\nnature--of the rotation of seasons, of wind, frost, rain; he uses them\nto provide food for those that hunger and must be fed. The third man\nlies under the trees. He digs no mine. He plants and reaps no corn and\ngrain. He simply lies under the trees, gazes into the sky and dreams.\nMen call him idle, but he is not so. One day he writes a book. It lives\na thousand years. His control is over the spirit of man. He has entered\ninto its hopes and sorrows, its aspirations and its dreams.\n\nThis story is a Parable of Kings. Such is the power of control that is\ngranted to each new soul. Each child is bequeathed at birth a sceptre\nand a crown.\n\nThe first rule is parental. The primitive monarchy is in the home. A\nyoung baby cries. The trained nurse turns on the light, lifts the baby,\nhushes it, sings to it, rocks it, and stills its weeping by caresses and\nsong. When next the baby is put down to sleep, more cries, more soothing\nand disturbance, and the setting of a tiny instinct which shall some day\nbe will--the power of control.\n\nThe grandmother arrives on the scene. When baby cries, she plants the\nlittle one firmly in its crib, turns down the light, pats and soothes\nthe tiny restless hands that fight the air, watches, waits. From the\ncrib come whimpers, angry cries, yells, sobs, baby snarls and sniffles\nthat die away in a sleepy infant growl. Silence, sleep, repose, and the\nbuilding of life and nerve and muscle in the quiet and the darkness. The\nbaby has been put in harmony with the laws of nature--the invigoration\nof fresh air, sleep, stillness--and the little one wakens and grows like\na fresh, sweet rose. The mother, looking on, learns of the ways of\nGod with men.\n\nFirmness is the true gentleness. There is a form of authority which must\nbe as implacable as the divine decree. Mercy is the requiring of\nobedience to law; it is not a cajoling training in law-defiance, which\nshall one day break the mother's heart and upset the social relations of\nthe world.\n\nThe next rule is personal: the direction of one's own energy in the way\nof one's own will. The child moves his hands, his feet; he turns his\nrattle up and down, and shakes it about. He discovers that he can pull\nthings toward him and push them away; that he can reach things that are\nhigher than his head. He begins to creep. He touches things that are the\nother side of the world from him, that is, across the room. He plucks\nfibres from the rug or carpet; swallows straws, buttons, and little\nstrings. He pounds, and sets up vibrations of pleasant noise; he clashes\nten-pins, he blows his whistle, squeezes his rubber horse and man,\nrattles the newspaper, flings about his bottle and his blocks. He feels\nhimself a self-directing power, and at times asserts this power against\nthe will of those who would make him do what he does not want to do. The\nlove of rule is in him, and he lays his little hands on power.\n\nEducation determines whether this power shall be for good or for evil.\nWe cannot take away power from any child--he shall move the affairs of\nnations--but we can direct this love of power, or crush it; strengthen\nit, or weaken it; turn it toward the highest help of man, or deflect it\nto tyranny, cruelty, and crime.\n\nChild-training is guidance in the way of God's decrees. It is not the\nsetting of one's own ideas upon a little child; it is not the\ngratification of one's own love of power; it is not the satisfaction of\none's own self-conceit. It is a firm, humble striving to carry on the\nharmony of the universe: to bring up the child to love order, justice,\nmercy, and truth.\n\nEducation is the teaching of how to direct energy for the universal\ngood. It lays hold of a child and, out of his destructive instincts--the\ninstinct to bang, and pull, and tear to pieces--it develops creative\npower, the inventive genius that lies hid within him. It takes the pure\nlove of noise, and trains it to pitches, harmonies, intervals, and makes\na musician of the boy who used to whack his spoon. It takes the alphabet\nand the early pothooks, and the boy by and by combines them into\nliterature. The apples and the peaches which he is taught to exchange\njustly are by and by transmuted into trade and commerce. He brings\ncargoes from Cuba and Ceylon, trades with Japan and Hawaii, and the\nAsiatic isles. The energy of block-building is developed into sculpture,\narchitecture, and civil engineering. The stamping of his foot in anger\nis directed to determination, perseverance, the rule of the brave\nspirit, the unconquerable will. Nothing is more marvellous than this\ngrave upbuilding.\n\nThe next rule is social: the direction of personal energy that shall\nleave a distinct impress on other lives. It is long before we realize\nthat for each exertion we are responsible; that what we do is held\nagainst us in strict account, not only by fate, which builds our destiny\nfor us out of our own deeds, but by every other person with whom we come\nin contact. Our fellows check off daily against us so much vitality, so\nmuch magnanimity, so much idleness, cruelty, spite, goodness,\nselfishness, meanness, or loving-kindness. Life holds a record of our\nevery deed, and from no least responsibility can we make our escape. We\nare the prisoners of events which we ourselves have brought about.\n\nThe discipline of ethics, of home-training, of the Church, and of\nreligious teaching is addressed fundamentally to this social\nconsciousness of ours, this responsibility which we cannot evade. To\nbear rule aright is to go forth into the world to build up, in\nauthority, talent, and influence, the kingdom of God.\n\n1. There is the agricultural phase of social rule. A man tills a farm.\nIt has upon it trees, streams, woodland, and meadow-land. He may\nrule--to what end? If he rules it for his own personal ends--merely to\nfill his granaries, and lay up gold--he rules it for miserliness, with a\nsort of thrift that is as passing in inheritance as the flying\nApril rain.\n\nOr he may say: I will keep my land in trust for God. I will hold rain\nand frost, heat and cold, storm and sun, in fee simple for the race. My\ngrain shall pass out into the world's mart, sent forth with love and\nprayer. Such a farmer is the incarnation of moral grandeur. Let men\nlaugh, if they will, at his overalls and plough, his wide-brimmed hat,\nhis simple manners, and his homely, racy speech. His feet are by the\nfurrow, but his heart is in heaven, and his treasure is there also. Says\nthe author of _Nine Acres on the Hillside_, \"The agriculturist walks\nside by side with the Creator.\"\n\nThere is a fine integrity which lies in land. There is a resolution\nwhich is concerned with crops. There is a wisdom born of wind and\nweather. There is a power which comes from the constant revival of life\nin seed and fruit and flower. This man is King of God's Acres. Let him\nnot despise his kingdom, and may the succession not depart from\nhis house!\n\n2. There is a rule which is industrial. A man is sent into the world to\nwield a hammer, a saw, and run an engine. If his rule over his hammer is\nweak, if he does not know how to use it well, if its blow is uncertain\nand its result unskilled, then he passes from the line of kings, and is\nsubject, instead of in authority, in his own domain. He is captive to a\npiece of steel or wood. So with every tool of trade. Each man who\nconquers his tool is a ruler--is in control of elements of human\nhappiness and good. The roof-mender, the furnace-builder, the\ncloth-weaver, the yarn-spinner, the steel-worker, the miller--do not\nthese all keep the race warmed, and clad, and fed?\n\n3. The next rule is commercial. Trade itself is neither menial nor\ndemeaning. Rightly used, it is a high form of control. People have\nthings to buy and things to sell. The maker is handicapped. He cannot\ntravel elsewhere to dispose of what he has. The buyer is ignorant. He\ndoes not know where to go, or cannot go, at first-hand, for the shoes,\nthe hat, the reaper, the bricks, the lumber, the stationery which he\nmust use. There appears upon the scene the man of observation, of\ninvestigation, of capital, of shrewdness, of resources. With one hand he\ngathers the products of the Pacific and of the South Seas. With the\nother, he takes the output of the Atlantic seaboard, the Gulf States,\nthe Mississippi valley, the northern lakes and hills. He sets up an\nestablishment, he puts forth runners, advertisements, and show-windows.\nHe stocks shelves, decks counters, and employs clerks, packers,\nsalesmen, cash-boys, buyers, and department heads. The man who wants to\nbuy, buys from a man across the sea and yet is served in his own town.\n\nThe man of commercial power is a man of world-wide rule. He may lay up\nin banks a fortune which he intends to try to spend upon himself; or he\nmay say: I am accountable for the pocket-books of the world. I am in\nauthority over them. I open a market, or close it. I buy, dispense, and\ndisperse human labor. I create wants, and I satisfy them. I will\nestablish honest laws of trade. What I do shall be rated as commercial\nlaw. What I say shall be quoted as a way of equity and probity. That man\nis a King of Trade. His throne is set upon hills and seas. His subjects\nare all men with needs, and all men with products of the land, the\ncoasts, the sea, or brain, or skill. This is the lawful King of Trade.\nHe represents God's mart of exchange. Primarily, goods are not bought\nand sold in the market. They are first transferred in that man's brain.\n\n4. Another rule is of concerted works: the rule of the Engineer. Back of\nevery advance in our country, in facilities of trade and transportation,\nor of public health and safety, stands the man who thought it out. Take,\nfor instance, the development of the \"Great American Desert.\" Who\nprojected its irrigation, by which areas have been redeemed from\nbarrenness and waste? Who planned the economic use of the Niagara Falls?\nWho built the Brooklyn Bridge? Who projected the vast waterway from\nChicago to the Gulf? Who first thought of a cable across the depths of\nseas? Who bridged the Firth of Forth, the Ganges, the Mississippi? Who\nprojected the gray docks of Montreal? the Simplon Tunnel? Who wound the\niron rails across the Alleghanies, the Rockies, the Sierras? Who drew\nthe wall that has encircled China for a thousand years? Who projected\nthe Suez Canal? the Trans-Siberian Railway? Who sunk the mines of\nEldorado? Who designed the Esplanade at Hamburg? the stone banks of the\nSeine? the waterways of Venice? the aqueducts of Rome? the Appian Way?\nthe military roads of Chili and Peru? the Subway in New York?\n\nGravity, stress, strain, weight, tension, sag, cohesion,--a few\nmathematical formulas, and a knowledge of the primary laws of\nphysics,--upon such principles as these, the world is rapidly changing\nform and use.\n\nThe Engineer, in a strange and subtle way, stands near to God. His work\nis done hand-in-hand with God. He takes the forces of nature and the\nlaws of the material world, and bends them to the needs and use of man.\nSky and sea or desert may be about him. He knows the arctic cold, the\ntropic heat; the forest and the plain; the mountain and the marsh; the\nbrook and river; the peak and the precipice; the glacier and the tempest\nin their course. Out of the very elements he is daily building new paths\nfor man to tread. Soon he, too, must pass; laid after death, it may be,\nbeside some mighty water that his handiwork has spanned.\n\nIn loneliness and silence does he not often think, I wonder, of the God\nwith whom he deals? It is God who provides the river and the sea; God\nwho through endless ages has piled stone on stone, crust on crust, and\nhas crumpled the strata of the earth as tissue in His hand. It is God\nwho has bound every mote to the earth-centre; who has sent magnetic\ncurrents coursing through the globe, and has made tides and sea-changes,\nand the trade-winds to blow. It is the God of the Gulf Stream, the\nCaribbean Sea, the God of the Appalachians, the God of the Himalayas,\nthe God of the Cordilleras, of the Amazon, the Yukon, the Yang-tse-Kiang\nwith which he really deals.\n\nThe endless ages pass and go, but God abides. Little, daring man lifts\nhere and there a hand to mould the world which God has made--pricks the\nearth for gold or silver, iron or coal--but GOD is everywhere immanent\nand shines through every hour of change. Hence the March of Engineers is\nthe march of men whom God has trained; in a special sense His\nmaster-workmen, craftsmen whom He loves. It is theirs to say, We are the\nKings of Works: the Master-builders of the Most High!\n\n5. There are Kings of Academic Thought, men who lead in professions and\nin collegiate careers. The wise man is the true aristocrat. His court\nmay not be in a palace, but within its precincts are received and\nentertained the leaders of the race. To be provost, to be college\npresident or university professor, is to be seated on an\nintellectual throne.\n\nThe problem of academic rule is not to attract a large number of\nstudents, to put up imposing buildings, to have endowments, and fill\nchairs with learned specialists; to grant many degrees, and to keep the\nhum of a teaching staff and of a student body alive in the ears of a\ncommunity, marking the college group by flags and colors, cap and gown,\nprocessions and occasions. These things are right, but are mainly\naccessory. We have not all of a university when we have men and\nbuildings, money, students, brains. Back of a university there lies its\nfoundation-idea, that of academic control.\n\nWhat is academic rule? It is rule over the pride of man. A college is a\nplace whose chief power is to inculcate humility by the means of true\nlearning; to establish intellectual honor and integrity by searching out\nthe ways of God in nature, science, and philosophy, and in letters\nand in art.\n\nIt is the primary work of a university to make men humble. The Freshman\nis not teachable. The Sophomore is an intellectual upstart. But by the\ntime a man has been beaten and conquered by the great ideals of the\nworld, which have pierced his bones and humbled his conceit--by the time\nthe race-passions and the race-sorrows have crept across his spirit, by\nthe time that he has been confronted with the achievements of Homer,\nEmpedocles, Hippocrates, Michelangelo, Socrates, Buddha, Plato, Emerson,\nGladstone, Bismarck, Lincoln, and Carlyle--his self-exaltation drops\nfrom him like a garment. He--who knows how to construe a few pages of\nthe classics, who knows how to demonstrate a few mathematical problems,\nscan a few verses, recite a few odes, carry on a few scientific\nexperiments, undertake a small research--how shall he compete with these\nrulers of the thought of men?\n\nThen it is that the real rule of a university--its spirit of humility,\nand of reverence for antiquity--begins. The true university man, born\nand bred in the century, not in the years, in the race halls, not those\nalone in his Alma Mater, is neither a scoffer nor an atheist, nor a\ncritic, sceptic, or cynic. He is a man of simple and exalted faith. God,\nwho hath brought such great things to pass in science, nature, and art,\nin human character, in the destiny of nations, and the history of humble\nmen and women, is a God before whom there must be awe and reverence, and\nnot a flippant scouting of the ancient ideals. Man, who is so tried by\ntemptation and scourging of the spirit, is a creature to be loved,\nappreciated, understood; not a being to whom shall be shown arrogance,\naloofness, and pride. The university that makes snobs of its graduates\nhas not yet entered into its kingdom of control.\n\nA university also holds rule over truth. Absolute truth is in God's\nhand. But the university has class-rooms and libraries, apparatus and\nlaboratories, which are intended for the discovery and furtherance of\ntruth. The university is not a place to cry out for big salaries. The\nsalaries should be living salaries. The seeker after truth should not be\nleft without enough money for heat and shelter, for bread and meat, rest\nand summer-change; for the coming of children and their education. But\ntruth may lodge without shame in an humble dwelling and may be greatly\nfurthered without an elaborate bill of fare.\n\nThe university men of the times are the establishers of a kind of\nrighteousness that is not always found in books. Their individual value,\nas they go out into the world, is to set right values on social customs\nand decrees; to establish the law of freedom in the home; to lead men\nand women out of the thraldom of ignorance, vulgarity, hearsay, and\n\"style,\" into simplicity of living and a sane scale of household\nexpense. The university leader of the future is the man who shall set\nlaws over household accounts and who shall rule over such simple things\nas what best to eat and buy. He shall be an economist of the larger\nsort, providing for the spiritual necessities of men and their moral\nconduct, rather than for their balls, card-parties, and social\nside-shows, including church entertainments and philanthropic dances and\nbazaars. He shall pave the way to a larger view of wealth, influence,\nand reform; endue man with a keener sense of his own responsibilities,\nmake him a creature of larger desires and of more aspiring wants.\n\nIn particular, he shall pass down from generation to generation the high\nand noble learning of the past; he shall keep alive the flower of\ncourtesy and charity; he shall tell the dreams of past sages, and\ninterpret them; he shall review the thronging nations; and he shall so\nimbue the mind with a love of truth, of ideals, of excellence, of honor,\nthat a new race shall go out into a larger and a nobler world. And then\na better day shall dawn for men.\n\n6. The Kings of State. Says Milton, in his sonnet on Cromwell:\n\n                              \"_Yet much remains\n     To conquer still; Peace hath her victories\n     No less renowned than War: new foes arise,\n     Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains.\n     Help us to save free conscience from the paw\n     Of hireling wolves, whose gospel is their maw_.\"\n\nIn the third moon of the year 1276, Bayan, the conquering lieutenant of\nGenghis Khan, captured Hangchow, received the jade rings of the Sungs,\nand was taken out to the bank of the river Tsientang to see the spirit\nof Tsze-sue pass by in the great bore of Hangchow--that tidal wave which\nannually rolls in, and, dashing itself against the sea-wall of Hangchow,\nrushes far up the river, bringing, for eighteen miles inland, a tide of\nfresh, deep-sea splendor, and thrilling all who see or hear.\n\nIn the life of nations there are times and tides. Against the tide-wall\nof history, beaten by many a storm, and battered by many a thundering\nwave, there is about to sweep the incoming wave of a new life for the\nrace: there is about to pass a greater than the spirit of Tsze-sue,--even\nthe Spirit of God!\n\n     \"_We are living,-we are dwelling,\n        In a grand and awful time,\n     Age on age to ages telling,\n        To be living is sublime_!\"\n\nWe are moving out into a period of great statesmen, and of great\npolitical standards and ideals. The days before us are days which will\nmake the Elizabethan era pale in history. Upon the head of our nation\nare set responsibilities such as have never before rested on any\none man.\n\nThe day of the true statesman is here; the day of the demagogue is done!\nThe rule of the orator is over the ideals and hopes of men. The\ndemagogue prostitutes this power. His rule is over the passions,\nprejudices, and resentments of men. He cries aloud in the market-place,\nand rogues and ward-heelers, and evil-minded politicians, group\nthemselves around him. He waves his sceptre over the vulgar and the\nrascals of the town.\n\nThe vital problem of municipal reform is not the shattering of the ring,\nthe overturning of the boss, the gagging of a few loud tongues. It is\nthe problem of the training of better bosses; the education of men and\nwomen in social control; their enlightenment, from childhood up, in\ncivic duties, in national affairs, and the conduct of civil power.\nThereupon oratory turns to its higher ends. Through statesman, preacher,\nand political teacher, it cries aloud of righteousness. I look for the\ntime when the typical politician shall be an honorable man; when to be\n\"in the ring\" of municipal or national control shall mean to be an\nintegral and orderly part of the administration of God's great world;\nwhen city life shall be purified; and when international law shall be\nthe interpretation of the will of the Almighty for the rule of nations.\nWe have honest doctors, lawyers, tradesmen; shall we not have an honest\npolitician and an upright ward-boss?\n\nPublic service is a god-like service! Our Presidents shall more and more\nbe chosen, not alone for ideas, experience, or for party affiliations:\nthe President shall be chosen because he is a moral hero! Something has\nstirred in the heart of the American people, which shall not soon be\nstilled: a spiritual outlook upon political preferment. In the White\nHouse we long to have the great spiritual exemplars of our race. Not\nalone in church shall we offer up a \"Prayer before Election.\" The time\nis coming when each true ballot-slip shall be a prayer.\n\nWithin the next fifty years shall be determined some of the greatest\nquestions of history. Among them shall be questions of industrial\nadjustment and development, and of social progress. We must have in our\nCabinet not only the representatives of War and State, of Finance,\nTrade, Labor, and Agriculture; but also of Education and of Social\nHealth. This is not a dream. You and I may live to see the results of\nthis religious awakening: it is elemental and epochal.\n\nBack of all individual dominion there is rising a yet higher\ndominion--the dominion of the English-speaking race. We, having been\ncalled by the providence of God to stand at the head of the march of\nprogress, may well ask ourselves concerning our imperial powers. The\nline of progress for a nation is to allow no spiritual ideal to stagnate\nor to retrograde. The spiritual aspiration of a nation always dominates\nwhat is called the Social Mind. We grow toward what we worship. It is\nours to plant the dominion of civilization in foreign lands, and to\nsupplant a waning culture by a richer, truer, and nobler way of life.\nThe first thought of each of us, entering these new lands, whether\nmerchant, soldier, educator, or missionary, should be to hold Christ\naloft, that all tribes may come to His light, and kings to the\nbrightness of His rising.\n\nGod leads us on. Said Lincoln: \"I have been driven many times to my\nknees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go. My\nown wisdom, and that of all about me, seemed insufficient for that day.\"\nLike a vast Hand stretched against the sky of Time is the Hand of God--a\nHand writing, in these wondrous days, a destiny for generations yet to\nbe! Rising with us are all God-fearing nations--the Teutonic, Slav, and\nLatin peoples. Sitting yet in darkness, and massed against us, crouch\nsullenly the immemorial hordes of Asia, the wild blacks of the African\nswamps and jungles, and the dwellers of Polynesian seas. Occident and\nOrient, the world's battalions are forming for new encounters and new\ndismays. Never since the strong-limbed Goths changed the face of Europe\nhas there been a period of such tense anticipation, nor so great a\npossibility of volcanic change. We are entering an historic period of\nreconstruction, when new maps of the world will be drawn. The sceptre is\npassing into new hands: to-day the throne of civilization is being\narched above the seaway which joins London and New York. To-morrow, it\nmay be builded above Pacific tides, where our own shores look westward\nto the ports of Asiatic Russia. For, rising on the world-horizon, are\nthese two World-empires, Russia and the United States. The dictators of\nthese two countries will soon become the dictators of the human race.\nThey are brave and virile nations, with untold reserves of power! As\nthese two giants gird themselves for World-dominion, who but God shall\ngird the armor on, direct the onward course of change?\n\nMuch of the ancient wealth and beauty shall be done away. In a few\ngenerations the shrines of thirty centuries will be no more. Fane and\ntemple and pagoda will disappear; carvings, images, and Sikh-guarded\ncourts. Long lines of yellow-robed priests will chant their last\nprocessional hymn to Buddha, and the smoking incense to waning gods\nshall be quenched forever. Where Tao rites were celebrated, silence\nshall fall; where fakir and dervish tortured and immolated their lives,\nhappy children shall play. Instead of the lotos of the Ganges and the\nNile, there shall bloom the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Vale.\n\nBut as the empires of Buddha and Muhammad fall, a new Empire shall\nprevail!\n\n     \"_Kings shall bow down before Him,\n        And gold and incense bring;\n      All nations shall adore Him,\n        His praise all people sing.\n      To Him shall prayer unceasing\n        And dally vows ascend;\n      His kingdom still increasing,\n        A kingdom without end_.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE WORLD-MARCH: OF PRELATES AND EVANGELISTS\n\n     [LYONS]\n\n     _O Majesty throned, O Lord of all Light,\n     Shine down on our spirits and scatter the night;\n     As Adam received his life-impulse from Thee,\n     Endued with all fulness, we quickened would be_\n\n     _Let all that we know--love, learning, and power--\n     Melt down in Thy Presence, and flame in this hour;\n     Anoint us and bless us and lift our desire\n     And grant us to speak as with tongues touched with fire_!\n\n     _Life flows as a dream--its pleasures are dear:\n     The world is about us--temptation is near;\n     Oh, guide us, and shew us the pathway to God\n     The feet of the prophets aforetime have trod_!\n\n     _The bells cease their chime,--the hosts enter in:\n     May many be purged of their sloth and their sin!\n     Cheer Thou the despondent, the weary, the sad,\n     Rouse all to rejoicing, that all may be glad_.\n\n     _And when life is o'er, and each must depart\n     In quaking and silence,--abide with each heart;\n     The songs of Thy saints then caught up to the skies,\n     As waves of great waters shall thunderous rise_!\n\n     ANNA ROBERTSON BROWN LINDSAY\n\nIn Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_ there is the legend of the Sword of Assay.\nIn the church against the high altar was a great stone, four-square,\nlike unto a marble stone. In the midst of it was an anvil of steel, a\nfoot high, and therein stood a naked sword by the point. About the sword\nthere were letters written, saying, \"Whoso pulleth out this sword of\nthis stone and anvil, is righteous king born of all England.\" Many\nassayed to pull the sword forth, but all failed, until the young Arthur\ncame, and, taking the sword by the handle, lightly and fiercely pulled\nit out of the stone! By this token he was lord of the land.\n\nEach man's life is proved by some Sword of Assay. The test of a man's\ncall to the ministry is his power to seize the Sword of the Spirit:\nwield the spiritual forces of the world, insight, conviction,\npersuasion, truth. To do this successfully at least five things appear\nto be necessary: a sterling education, marked ability in writing and in\npublic speaking, a noble manner, a voice capable of majestic\nmodulations, and a deep and tender heart. These phrases sound very\nsimple, but perhaps they mean more than at first appears. Have we not\nall met some one, in our lifetime, whose acquaintance with us seemed to\nhave no preliminaries?--some one who never bothered to say anything at\nall to us, until one day he said something that leaped and tingled\nthrough our very being? This is the power that a minister ought to have\nwith every soul with whom he comes in contact: his word should quickly\ntouch a vital spot. No one to-day cares much for mere oratory, literary\ndiscussion, polemics, or cursory exegesis; \"marked ability in writing\nand in public speaking\" means that grip on reality which makes people\nquiver, repent, believe, adore!\n\nSincerity is the basis of such power. At heart we worship the man who\nwill not lie; who will not use conventions or formulas in which he does\nnot believe; who does not give us a second-hand view of either life or\nGod; who does not play with our conscience because it is not politic to\nbe too direct; who does not juggle with our doubts, nor ignore our hopes\nand powers; who also frankly acknowledges that he, too, is a man.\n\nA call to the ministry also involves an over-mastering spiritual desire.\nTell me what a man wants, and I will tell what he is, and what he can\nbest do. If a man desires above all things to conduit a great business,\nhe is by nature qualified for trade; if he desires knowledge, he is\ndesigned for a scholar; if he is always observing form, rhyme, aesthetic\nbeauty, and striving to produce verse, he is a born poet. But if the one\nthing that rules his dreams is the longing for spiritual power--the\nthought of impressing God upon his generation, and leading men to a\nclearer view of life and duty--he is a born minister of the Spirit, and\nto the spirit of the sons of men. Along with this goes the great burden:\n\"Woe is me, if I preach not the Gospel!\"\n\nWherever, to-day, there is a young man in whose heart is stirring a\ngreat devotional dream for the race, who longs to project his life into\nthe most enduring and far-reaching influence, who craves the exercise of\ngreat gifts and powers, there is a man whose heart God is calling to\npossibilities such as no one can measure, and to triumphs such as no one\ncan forecast! The highest triumphs of these coming years are to be\nspiritual. The leader is to be the one who can carry the deepest\nspiritual inspiration to the hearts of his fellow-men. Do not let the\nhour go by! This day of vision is the prophetic day!\n\nBut if the call be answered, if certain high-spirited and noble-minded\nmen ask thus to stand as spiritual ministrants to the souls of men, how\nshall they be trained for the high office?\n\nThe old way will not do. Sweeping changes, in these last days, have come\nover the commercial, academic, and social world. We do not go back to\nthe hand-loom, the hand-sickle, the hand-press. What is true of these\naspects of life is true of the spiritual training. It must be larger,\nfreer, grander, than before. Time was when a theologian, it was\nthought, must be separated from the world--an ascetic working in the dim\nhalf-light of the old library, or scriptorium, or hall. To-day, he must\ngain much of his training from the great life of the world--learn how to\nmeet men and occasions, and be prepared to deal with modern forces and\nenergies with courage, knowledge, and decision.\n\nWe read of the earnest Thomas Goodwin: his favorite authors were such as\nAugustine, Calvin, Musculus, Zanchius, Paraeus, Walaeus, Gomarus, and\nAmesius. What Doctor of Theology takes the last six of these to bed with\nhim to-day?\n\nOur theological courses are too dry. Look carefully over the catalogues\nof thirty or forty of our own seminaries, and notice the curious, almost\nmonastic, impression which they make. Then realize that the men who\npursue these abstruse and mediaeval subjects are the men who go out into\nchurches where the chief topics of thought and conversation are crops,\nstocks, politics, clothes, servants, babies! There is a grim humor in\nthe thing, which seems to have escaped those who have drawn up the\ncurriculum.\n\nLife is not monastic. It is very lively. We scarcely get, in all our\npost-collegiate life, a chance to sit and muse. We go through\nsensations, experiences, and incongruities, which stir a sense of fun. A\nman reads (I notice) in his seminary, St. Leo, _Ad Flaeirmum_, and makes\nhis first pastoral call on a woman who proudly brings out her first\nbaby for him to see. _Ad Flaeirmum_ indeed! What does St. Leo tell the\nyouth to say?\n\nWhat should be breathed into a man in the seminary, is not the mere\nfacts of ecclesiastical history, but the warm pulsating currents of\nhuman life; the profound significance of the founding and the progress\nof the Church; a deep psychological understanding of human desires,\nmotives, joys, ambitions, griefs; the relentlessness of sin; the help\nand glory of Redemption; the quickening of the Christ; the vigor and the\ntenderness of faith. Coincident with these must be a growth in depth and\ndignity of life. No one likes to take spiritual instruction from men who\nare themselves crude, foolish, sentimental, or conceited. Many social\nsnags on which young ministers are sure to run, are simply the rudiments\nof social conduct, as practised by the world. Noble manners are one's\npersonal actions as influenced and guided by the great behavior of the\nrace. Under the impulse of ideals, much that is untoward or superficial\nin one's bearing will disappear. It is impossible to think as noble men\nand women have thought--to dream, love, and work as they have dreamed,\nloved, and wrought--and not have pass into one's mien the high\nexcellence of such lives.\n\nThe first education is spiritual. Until mind and heart are swept by the\nspirit of God, chastened, purified, ennobled, and inspired, vain is all\nthe learning of the schools! To this end, there should be a more deeply\nspiritual atmosphere in our seminaries, less of the mere academic\nimpulse. In every age, there are men just to come in contact with whom\nis a benediction and a help for years. Such a man was Mark Hopkins, Noah\nPorter, James McCosh. Such the leading men in every seminary should be.\n\nThe plan of education must be of principles, not of facts. The\nuniversity research-men gather facts, and scientific men everywhere\ncollect, analyze, and classify them. But each small department of human\nlearning--each minute branch in that department--needs a lifetime for\nthe mastery of that one theme. Hence the work of the college is quite\napart from that of the school of theology. It is the place of the school\nof theology, not to ignore the New Learning, but to group, upon the\nbasis of a thorough college training, certain great interests and\npursuits of mankind, in such a way as to afford, by means of them, a\nleverage for spiritual work.\n\nAfter all is said and done, it is not the grammar-detail of Latin,\nGreek, Hebrew, and Aramaic dialects that makes a minister's power. It is\nthe strange language-culture of the race which should enter in; the\ninner vitality of words, the beauty of poetic cadences, the strong flow\nof rhythm, noble themes, great thoughts, impressive imagery and appeal.\nWe should know the Bible as literature, not as one knows a story-book,\nor a dialect-exercise, but as one knows the melodies and memories of\nchildhood.\n\nThe vital thing is not a knowledge of the historical schisms and decrees\nof Christendom--not the external Evidences of Religion, Ecclesiastical\nHistory, Ecclesiastical Polity, monuments, texts, memorabilia--the vital\nthing is the power to think about God, and the problems of mankind. It\nis a heart-knowledge of the difficulties and questionings of a race that\nyearns for virtue.\n\nMan thirsts for God. No one is wholly indifferent to the Spirit. I fear\nthat some ministers do not know--and never will know--the heart-hunger\nof the world. When they rise to speak, there is always some one present\nwhose breath is hushed with longing to hear spoken some real word of\ntruth, or strength, or comfort. If he receive but chaff!--\n\nTheology is not a dry thing, and ought not be made so. It is quick with\nthe life of the race. Each dogma is a mile-stone of human progress. It\nis the sifted and garnered wisdom of the centuries, concerning God, and\nHis ways with men. Each student should feel, not that a system is being\ndriven into him, as piles are driven into the stream, but that he is\nbeing put in philosophic contact with the thought of the race on the\ngreat topic of Religion, with liberty himself to experiment, think, and\nadd to the store.\n\nHomiletics is not a series of nursery-rules for man--formal, didactic\ndroppings of a pedant's tongue. Homiletics is the appeal of man to man,\nfor the welfare of his soul, and the true progress of mankind. Exegesis\nis not a matter of Hebrew or Greek alone. It includes the spiritual\ninterpretation of the great problems of the race. Homer, Tennyson,\nBrowning, and Dante are exegetes, no less than Lightfoot, Lange,\nand Schaff.\n\nPastoral Divinity is not the etiquette of a polite way of making calls:\nit is an entering into the social spirit of the time; the learning of\nfriendliness, unreserve, sympathy, persuasion, and a way of approach. It\nis the mastery of spiritual _savoir-faire_.\n\nOutside of this group of technical subjects there are yet others of\nvital importance from a scientific understanding of the world, and of\none's work. They are Psychology, Ethics, Sociology, and Politics.\n\nSince we have known more of the psychological meaning of adolescence, a\nnew theory of Conversion has sprung up; and whether or not we accept it,\nthe whole outlook over the underlying principle of conversion has been\nchanged. We must at least recognize that conversion is a scientific\nprocess, as much as digestion is, or respiration; it is not a purely\nemotional occurrence.\n\nThe minister must learn what society really is, and how the far still\nforces of time act and react upon each other, producing group-actions,\ninstitutions, customs, ways. There are social fossils as well as\nphysical ones. Sociology is not a system of fads and reforms. It is the\nscientific study of society, of its constitution, development,\ninstitutions, and growth. He must also breathe largely of the great\ngovernmental life of the race--understand the primary principles of\npolitics and administration. He should have some knowledge of commercial\ninterests, of the formulas, incentives, and right principles of trade.\n\nThere should also be in the seminary an inspirational atmosphere of\nmusic, literature, and art. Literature is a revelation of the life of\nthe soul. The man who reads literature and comprehends its message is\nreceiving a fine training which shall fit him for a thorough\nunderstanding of the heart; of its practical, ethical, and spiritual\nproblems; of its domestic joys and sorrows; of its human cares and\nburdens; of the appeals that will come to him for sympathy; of the\ntemptations that beset the race; and of the hopes and trials of\nthe world.\n\nLiterature is one of the best tools a minister can have. He should be\nread in the great literary and sermonic literature, the work of Bossuet,\nMassillon, Chrysostom, Augustine, Fenelon, Marcus Aurelius, mediaeval\nhomilies, Epictetus, Pascal, Guyon, Amiel, Vinet, La Brunetiere, Phelps,\nJeremy Taylor, Barrows, Fuller, Whitefield, Bushnell, Edwards, Bacon,\nNewman, Ruskin, Carlyle, Emerson, Davies, Law, Bunyan, Luther, Spalding,\nRobertson, Kingsley, Maurice, Chalmers, Guthrie, Stalker, Drummond,\nMaclaren, Channing, Beecher, and Phillips Brooks, yes, even John Stuart\nMill. All these men, by whatever name or school they are called, are\nwriters of essays or sermons which appeal to the most spiritual deeps\nof man.\n\nHe should read the novels of Richter, Thackeray, Dickens, Scott, Eliot,\nand Victor Hugo. He should know intimately the great verse which\ninvolves spiritual problems, and human strife and aspiration,--Milton,\nBeowulf, Caedmon, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, ballads, sagas, the\nArthur-Saga, the Nibelungenlied, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Herbert,\nTennyson, Browning, Dante and Christina Rossetti, Whittier, Lowell,\nLongfellow, to say nothing of Goethe, Corneille, and the Greek, Roman,\nPersian, Egyptian, Hindu, and Arabian verse.\n\nIn music his heart should wake to the beauty of oratorios, symphonies,\nchorals, concert music, national and military music, and inspiring\nsongs, not to speak of hymns and of anthems, the progress of Christian\nsong! The _Creation_, the _Messiah_, the _Redemption_, Bach's _Passion\nMusic_, the _St. Cecilia Mass_, Spohr's _Judgment_, Stainer's\n_Resurrection_, the _Twelfth Mass_, Mendelssohn's _Elijah_,--these are\nmonumental works and themes.\n\nWhat is a hymn? We think of it as being some simple churchly words, set\nto a serious tune. A hymn is the rhythmic aspiration of the race. No one\ncan look through a good hymnal--through _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, for\ninstance, or the Church Hymnary--without feeling that therein is bound\nup the devotional life of the world. The spiritual outlook is cosmic.\nOur every mood of penitence, praise, and aspiration resounds in\nmelodious and time-defying strains.\n\nIn art, the religious spirit broods over the great work of the world. In\nAngelo, Francesca, Veronese, Botticelli, Titian, Raphael, Tintoretto,\nand Correggio, the brush of the painter has set forth the adoration of\nthe Church of God.\n\nThus, taken all in all, to be educated as a minister should be to be\neducated in the Higher Life of the race.\n\nFinally, above all else is the spiritual study and interpretation of the\nWord of God. A minister may be fearless of the investigations of\nscientific criticism. Every truth is important to him, but not all\ntruths are vital. When a man such as Caspar Rene Gregory speaks,\nsomething of the holy mystery and inspiration of biblical research, as\nwell as a scientific result, is presented, and one gains a new\nconception of what it really means to study and to understand the\nWord of God.\n\nUnder all is the life of ceaseless and prevailing prayer. By the life of\nprayer, many mean merely a way of learning to make public petitions, an\nobjective appeal to God. The true life of prayer is as simple, as\nunteachable, and as vital as the life of a child with its mother--the\nlittle lips daily learning new ways of approach to its mother's heart,\nand new words to make its wants and interests and sorrows known.\n\nPrayer is the true World-Power. Just as there are vast stretches in the\nworld where the foot of man has never trod, so there are unmeasured\nregions whereon prayer has never been. The more we pray, the more\nillimitable appears this spiritual realm. And all about us in the\nuniverse are also great hidden forces: nothing will lay hold of them\nbut prayer.\n\nEach prayer enlarges the soul. The measure of our praying is the measure\nof our growth. No man has reached his full possibilities of achievement\nwho has not completed the circuit of his possible prayers. Power is\nproportionate to prayer.\n\nAnd last of all, there is the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. What it\nis, who may say? But that it is real, who can doubt? To read the lives\nof Wesley, Whitefield, Finney, Moody, is to feel a strange, deep thrill.\nThey are men who spake, and men listened; who called, and men came to\nGod. Others, alas, so often call, and there is no response. They cannot\nmake headway through the indifference, the sloth, the materialism, and\nthe inherent vulgarity of the world.\n\nThe life itself is arduous. After all is said, it is not quite the same\ntask to examine and classify either protoplasm or the most highly\norganized forms of nature, that it is to analyze and understand the\nmysterious workings of the heart, the intricacies of conscience and\nconduct, the possibilities of spiritual development or of moral\ndownfall, and the many questionings, agonies, and ecstasies of the soul\nof man. And they are to be studied and understood with the definite and\npositive aim of the absolute reconstruction of the world-bound spirit--a\nchange of its motives, purposes, affections, ideals. More than this,\nthere must be at the heart of the more thoughtful minister a philosophic\nbasis for the reconstruction of society itself.\n\nYouth is not an adequate preparation for this task: a man must live and\ngrow. To deal with such themes and occasions, there must appear in the\nworld lives of such vigor that they can command; of such charm, that\nthey can attract; of such wisdom, that they can guide and comfort; of\nsuch vitality, that they can inspire. And hence there rises before the\nmind's eye a figure that is both knightly and kingly--a man earnest in\nthe redress of wrong, and who yet holds a subtle authority over the\nforces that make for wrong; a man burdened with the cares and sorrows of\nmany others, and yet conducting his own life with serenity, enthusiasm,\ndignity, and hope; a man to whose keen yet tender gaze a life-history\nis revealed by a word or tone, but whose own eyes receive their light\nfrom God. A prophet and a father, a priest and a counsellor, a brother,\nfriend, and judge, a sacrifice and an inspiration should he be who, in\nreverence and love, brings before a waiting congregation the very\nWord of Life!\n\n\nSECOND: OF SPIRITUAL RULE\n\n1. The primary rule is over conscience. The man who sways a conscience\nsways a human life. The man who sways a nation's conscience controls\nthat nation's life. To rule conscience, a man must himself be\nunprejudiced and well informed. He must strive, not to keep up an\nunhealthy excitement which shall make conscience introspective and\nmorbid, but to preserve a sane moral outlook, to encourage freedom of\nthought and judgment, and to develop a normal conscience which reacts\npromptly against wrong. Conscience measures our inner recoil from evil.\nThe power of a preacher is in direct proportion to the energy with which\nhe reveals sin in the heart of man, and wakes his whole nature against\nits insidious power.\n\nSin is. To-day, sin is thought a somewhat brusque word, lacking in\npolish. To use it frequently is a mark of lack of '_savoir-faire_!\nIndeed to speak of it at all is as archaic as to speak of the\nIchthyosaurus. But sin is a root-fact of the life of man. It is the\noffice of the spiritual teacher to pluck out sin; to pierce the heart\nwith a recognition of the enormity of sin, and of its far-reaching\nconsequences; to stir the seared conscience, rouse the apathetic life,\nthrill the spiritual imagination, and to quicken the heart to better\nlove and to nobler dreams. He rebukes the private sins of individuals\nand the public sins of nations. In the _Faerie Queene_, the\n\"soul-diseased knight\" was in a state\n\n     \"_In which his torment often was so great,\n      That like a lyon he would cry and rare,\n      And rend his flesh, and his own synewes eat_.\"\n\nBut Fidelia, like the faithful pastor, was both\n\n                         \"_able with her word to kill,\n     And raise againe to life the heart that she did thrill_.\"\n\nThis power has at times been misunderstood and misapplied. No human\nauthority can bind the conscience, nor set rules and regulations for the\nsoul of man. The prerogative of final direction belongs to God alone. No\nman may arrogate it--no pastor for people, no husband for wife, no wife\nfor husband, no parent for child. The sadness of the world has been,\nthat men have not always been spiritually free. Freedom has been a\nsocial growth--a phase of progress. It has taken wars and persecutions,\nrevolutions and reformations, the blood of saints and martyrs, the\nsorrow of ages, to plant this precept in the mind of man.\n\nThe evangelist warns. He speaks of sin, death, hell, and the judgment\nto come. It is for these things that he is sent to testify. These are\nnot the catch-words of a new sort of Fear King who uses oral terrors to\naffright the soul of man. Heaven and hell are not a new sort of\nghost-land: retribution is not a larger way of tribal revenge.\n\nNo. The latest facts of science present this universe as not only\nprogressive, but as retributive. There is a rebound of evil which makes\nfor pain. Each broken law exacts a penalty. Each deed of sin is a\nforerunner of personal and of social disaster. The generation that sins\nshall be cut off, while the stock of the righteous grows strong from\nage to age.\n\nThe scientific vista opening to the eye of man is impressive and\nappalling. Each man has within himself a future of joy or sadness for\nthe race. Do you remember the sermon of Horace Bushnell on the\n\"Populating Power of the Christian Faith\"? Do you recall the history of\nthe infamous Jukes family? That of the seven devout and noble\ngenerations of the Murrays? The Day of Judgment is not only the Last\nGreat Day--it is to-day and every day. \"Every day is Doomsday,\" says\nEmerson. Nature is unforgetful. Nature is accountant. Each iniquity must\nbe paid for out of the resources of the race.\n\nIt is of these grave omens that the Man of God must speak. He dare not\nbe tongue-tied by custom or by fear. He must proclaim hell in the ears\nof all mankind. For wherever hell may be, and we do not yet know, and\nwhatever hell may be, and we cannot even imagine, Hell _is_; and the\nsoul of man must be kept mindful of these great things.\n\nThe evangelist comforts and consoles. The heart of man is wayward and\ngoes oft astray. No one can be belabored into righteousness. The true\nlover of souls allows for the hereditary weaknesses of man, for his\ninfirmities of will and temper, for his excuses, wanderings, and tears,\nand presents to him Jesus, in whose sight no one is too wretched to be\nreceived, too wicked to be forgiven.\n\nWe must have forgiveness in order to know God. The most comforting\nthought in the world is that God knows all we do. There can be no\nmisunderstanding between us: He cannot be misinformed.\n\nThe evangelist must come close, in sympathy and counsel, to the personal\nand individual life of those whom he would help. Perhaps the best way to\nemphasize this point would be to insert here words written by a woman\nwho has been thinking on this subject.\n\nShe says: \"I have never had a pastor. It is the one good thing lacking\nin my life. I have grown up among ministers, and have had many friends\namong them--some of them have cared for me. But there has never been one\namong them all who stood in an attitude of spiritual authority and\nhelpfulness to my life. We church-going and Christian men and women of\nthe educated class are almost wholly let alone; apparently no one takes\nthought for our souls. We are not in the least infallible; we come face\nto face with fierce temptations; we have heart-breaking sorrows; we are\nburdened with anxiety and perplexity. But we are left to grope as blind\nsheep; there is no one to point out the path to us, however dimly; no\none to say, at any crucial moment of our lives, Walk here!\n\n\"Once, however,\" she continues, \"one of my friends, a minister, knelt\ndown by me and prayed. It was a simple and ordinary occasion--others\nwere present. But every word of that prayer was meant for the uplifting\nof my heart. In that hour, I was as if overshadowed by the Holy Ghost;\nnew aims and purposes were born within me. My friend loves me--that does\nnot matter--it is his spiritual intensity I care for. And this is his\nreward for his fidelity and tenderness: In the hour when I come to die,\nwhen one does not ask for father or mother, or husband or wife, or\nbrother or sister, or friend or child, but only for the strong comfort\nof the man of God--in that hour, I say, if I be at all able to make my\nwishes known, I shall send for that man to come to me. He, and no other,\nshall present my soul to God.\"\n\nReading the above words, more than one minister will cry out, his eyes\nblazing: \"I say the same to you! Who is there that tries to shield the\nminister from sorrow and from pain? Who is there to comfort and help\n_him_? You think we can just go on, and preach, preach, preach, standing\nutterly alone, and with no one on earth to keep our own hearts close to\nGod! I tell you, it is a lonely and weary work at times, this being a\nminister!\"\n\nYes, there must be a people, as well as a pastor. The relation is\nreciprocal. Wherever there is a strong man, leaning down in fire and\ntenderness to help the lives about him, there must be a loyal and loving\ncongregation, with here and there in it some one who more fully\nappreciates and understands. Nothing beats down and discourages a man\nmore than to feel that he is preaching to cold air and not to human\nfolks, and to get back, when he offers sympathy, a stare.\n\nA congregation is a mysterious and subtle social force. Its effect on a\nminister he can neither analyze nor explain. But he knows that its power\nis mesmeric and cannot be escaped. He goes into its presence from an\nhour of exalted and uplifted prayer, serene, happy, strong, and prepared\nto speak words of power and life. Gazing at his people--he can never\ntell why--the words freeze on his lips. An icy hand seems laid upon his\nheart, and he makes a cold and formal presentation of his glowing theme,\nand wonders who or what has done it all. Something satanic and\nrepelling has laid hold of his tongue and brain.\n\nOr again, he may have had a worried and troubled week, full of personal\nanxiety and sorrow. He has not had full time to study--he feels quite\nunprepared, and enters the pulpit with a halting step, and a choking\nfear of failure at his heart.\n\nIn a moment, the world changes. Something imperceptible, but sweet and\ncomforting, steals over him,--an uplifting atmosphere of attention,\nsympathy, affection. He begins to speak, very quietly at first, with\nquite an effort. But the congregation leads him on, to deeper thoughts,\nto nobler words, to modulations of voice that carry him quite beyond\nhimself. His voice rises, and every syllable is firm and musical. His\nlanguage springs from some far centre of inspiration. He is conscious of\nsuperb power, and as sentence after sentence falls from his\nlips----sentences that amaze himself more than any other----he enters\ninto the supreme height of joy, that of being a spiritual messenger to\nthe hearts of longing men and women. He and they together talk of God.\n\nThis sympathetic atmosphere makes great preachers and great men. In\nreturn, there flows from a pastor toward his people a love that few can\nknow or understand.\n\n2. His rule is also over spiritual enthusiasm. What is a revival? We\nconfound it with a local excitement, a community-sensation of an\nhysterical and passing type--with sensational disturbances, falling\nexercises, shouts, weeping, and the like. A revival is something far\ndifferent. A revival is an awakening of the community heart and mind. It\nis a quickening of dead, backsliding, or inattentive souls.\n\nMan as an individual is quite a different person from the same man in a\ncrowd. One is himself alone; the other is himself, plus the influence of\nthe Social Mind. A revival is a social state, in which the social\nreligious enthusiasm is stirred up. It is a lofty form of religion, just\nas the patriotism which breaks forth in tears and cheers as troops go\nout to war is a finer type than the mere excitement and fervor of one\npatriotic man. What would the Queen's Jubilee have been, if but one\nsoldier had marched up and down? A great commemoration! If we grant the\nreality of national rejoicing in the royal jubilees, commercial\nrejoicing in business men's processions, university enthusiasm on\nCommencement Day--shall we not grant the reality of the religious\ninterest and enthusiasm of a great revival, in which whole communities\nshall be led to a clearer knowledge of spiritual things?\n\nThe Crusades were a magnificent revival. The Reformation was a revival.\nThe Salvation Army movement is a revival. But the greatest revival of\nall times is even now upon us: it is a revival in the scientific\ncircles of the race. Time was when science and religion were supposed to\nbe at odds; to-day the intellectual phalanxes are sweeping Christward\nwith an impetus that is sublime! Thinkers are finding in the large life\nof religion a motive power for their thought, their growth--a reason for\ntheir existence--a forecast of their destiny. We are beginning to\nrealize the dynamic value of Belief. This revival is coming, not with\nshouts and noise, but with the quiet insistence of new ideas, of new\nfacts--with the still voice of scientific announcement. The atheist is\nbeing overcome, not by emotion, but by evidence; the scoffer is being\nput down by cool logic.\n\nHence the evangelist of to-day is more than a man who can popularly\naddress a public audience, and by tales and tears arouse a weeping\ncommotion. The evangelist is a man of intellect and prayer, who can\npreach the gospel to a scientific age, and to a thinking coterie--a\ncoterie of college men and mechanics, of society women and\nservant-girls, of poets and of mine-diggers, of convicts and of\nreformers. To-day calls for the utmost intellectual resources of the\nteacher of the truth, for a great imagination, great style, great\nsympathy with men, large learning, and unceasing prayer!\n\n3. His rule is over social ideals. He must be a man of social insight.\nThe social spirit is abroad in the world, but it is woefully erratic\nand misguided. Any one thinks he can be an altruist. Why not? Take a\nclass in a college settlement, make some bibs for a day nursery, give\ntramps a C.O.S. card, with one's compliments, and attend about six\nlectures a year on Philanthropy--the lectures very good indeed. One is\nthen a full-fledged altruist, _n'est-ce pas_?\n\nThe philanthropy of to-day has a bewildering iridescence of aspect. Each\npresent impulse is reformatory. Correction, like a centipede, shows a\nhundred legs and wants to run upon them all. Much of the so-called\nphilanthropy is not well balanced and is run by cranks. Cranks attach\nthemselves to any social movement, as a shaggy gown will gather burrs.\nIt is not all of philanthropy to classify degenerates, titter at\nignorance, and to go a-peeping through the slums! We have not yet\nrealized the fulness of redemption. Of what avail is it to save one\nstreet-Arab, or one Chinaman, if a million Arabs and Chinamen remain\nunsaved? Redemption is a race-savior: it seizes not only the individual,\nbut his environment, his friends, and his future state.\n\nThe true minister is a reformer. A reformer is one who re-crystallizes\nthe social ideals of man, who breaks up idols and bad customs, and\nsweeps away abuses. But we must first ask: What is an idol? What is a\nbad custom? What is an abuse? They are social standards which are out of\nharmony with true concepts of God, life, and duty. Behind the work of\nthe reformer is the dream of the reformer, the meditation of the mystic,\nthe seer. He must first have in mind a plain, clear conception of what\nthe relation is of man to God, of what man's environment should be, and\nof what the society of the Kingdom should be. The reformer is one who\nchanges an existing social environment for approximately this ideal\nenvironment of his own thought. When he breaks an idol, it is not the\nidol itself that he everlastingly hates, it is the materialistic concept\nof the community. What he wishes in place of the idol is a right\nconception. No man could break up every idol in the Sandwich Islands.\nBut a man went about implanting a spiritual idea of God, and the idols\ndisappeared.\n\nHence the work of the reformer is deep and heart-searching work. It\nmeans constant study of the spiritual needs of the age, continual\ninsight into the material forces which are moulding the age-images,\nmoney, conquest, or whatever they may be. He wishes to maintain a\nspiritual hold on civilization itself, so to transform the ideal within\na man, a community, a nation, in regard to custom, observance, belief,\nthat the outer rite shall follow.\n\nTo reform is not to rush through the slums, and then preach a\nsensational sermon about bad places in the slums, of which most people\nnever knew before! To reform is to know something of the conditions\nwhich produce the slums--it is not to scatter the slum-people broadcast\nelsewhere in the town; it is not alone to give them baths, playgrounds,\ncirculating libraries of books and pictures, dancing-parties, and social\nclubs. To reform the slums is to set up a new ideal of God, and of\nrighteous conduct in the heart of the slum-dwellers. One must know\nsomething of the slow processes of social change, of social\nassimilation, growth, and stability, to have an intellectual perception\nof the problem, as well as a spiritual one. One does not make an ill-fed\nchild strong by stuffing five pounds of oatmeal down its throat!\n\nThe reformer must not only be a man of energy, he must be a man of\npatience. Great reforms come slowly. As man has advanced, idleness,\nindolence, brutality, tyranny, drunkenness, cant, and social scorn are\ngradually being cast out. But behind these simple words lie hid\ncenturies of strife and endeavor, and limitless darkenings of\nhuman hope.\n\nTo fly against vice is merely to invite enmity and opposition. To\npresent a pure and noble ideal, to breathe forth a holy atmosphere for\nthe soul, are constructive works. The trouble is not, that the ministers\npreach on social themes--all themes that concern the life of man are\nsocial themes. It is that they do piece-work and patch-work of reform,\ninstead of plain, direct upbuilding work in the souls and consciences of\nmen. To preach upon horse-stealing is one thing. The horse-stealer may\nbe impressed, convicted, made penitent, and return the stolen horse. But\nnot until his heart is imbued with a spiritual conception of honesty, as\nthe law of God, will he steal a stray horse no more. Hence the first\nquestions in reform are not: How many groggeries are there in my parish?\nHow many corrupt polls? How many hypocrites on my church-roll? The\nquestion is: How is my parish society in enmity to the highest spiritual\nideal I know? Many men preach about saloons, when they ought to be\npreaching about Christ.\n\nThe force of this reform-energy is uncomputed. We hear of occasional\ngreat reformers, but forget that there has been a prevailing influence\nextending over the ages, of holy men of God, who have preached and\ntaught and prayed; who have preserved our social institutions of\nspiritual import, and have been a mighty and continuous force working\nfor righteousness and peace.\n\nMissions are a higher form of politics. To further missions is to\nfurther government, international comity, world-peace.\n\n4. His rule is over creed. He is inevitably a teacher of doctrine.\n\nWhat is doctrine? Doctrine is spiritual truth, formulated in a\nsystematic way. It is also, in church matters, a system of truth which\nhas been believed in, and clung to, by a body of believers constituting\nsome branch of the catholic Church.\n\nIt is a noble and serious office to hand down from generation to\ngeneration the faith and traditions of the Church of God. But this\nhanding-down must be upright. \"You must bind nothing upon your charges,\"\nsays Jeremy Taylor, \"but what God hath bound upon you.\" Conviction is at\nthe root of the lasting traditions of the Church. Only this--his\nconviction--can one man really teach another. If he try to speak\notherwise, he shall have a lolling and unsteady tongue.\n\nNo soul is finally held by the indefinite, or the namby-pamby. It begins\nto question, Upon what foundation does this phrase, this fine sentiment,\nrest? It must stand upon a proposition. This proposition rests either\nupon a scientific fact, or upon that which, for want of a more definite\nterm, we call the religious instinct of man. But a proposition cannot\nstandalone. It is connected with other propositions, arguments,\nconclusions. Hence a system of logic, of philosophy, of expressed\nbelief, of doctrine, inevitably grows up in a thinking community, a\nthinking Church.\n\nThe statement of an ecclesiastical system of doctrine may not be the\nabsolutely true one, nor the final one. Doctrine changes, even as\nscientific theories change with fuller information. Doctrine also\nexpands, with the growth of the human spirit and understanding. To-day,\nin one's library, one has a thousand books. They are shelved and\ncatalogued, for reference, in a special order. But years hence, one's\ngrandson, who inherits these books, may have ten thousand books. The\naspect of the library is changed. It is filled with new volumes, and new\nthought. Shall we give a liberty to a man's library which we refuse to\nhis belief? Must he--and his church--have only his grandfather's ideas,\nstandards, and decrees?\n\nThe tenets of a sect are the theological arrangement of belief which for\nthe present seems best; it is the systematic arrangement of facts so far\nexamined, determined, and classified. But no system of theology can be\nfinal. Thought is moving on. Experience is progressive. Providence is\ncontinually revealing. The race is a creed-builder, as well as a builder\nof pyramids, cathedrals, and triumphal arches.\n\nThe building-up of doctrine is superb. Into doctrine are woven the\nintellectual beliefs, the emotional experiences, and the spiritual\nstruggles of mankind. Doctrine is an attempt to classify the spiritual\nproblems of the race and to present a theory of redemption which shall\nbe adequate, spiritually progressive, and the exact expression, so far\nas yet revealed, of the will of God for man. All Christian doctrine is\ncentred about one point: the redemption of the race from sin. Dealing\nwith such great and fundamental themes, each system of doctrine is an\nintellectual triumph.\n\nDoctrine is an intellectual necessity. Christ is not sporadic, either in\nhistory or philosophy. To teach Christ, as the unlettered savage may\nwho has just learned of Christ the Saviour and turns to teach his\nfellow-savages, might do good or save a soul from death. But in order to\ncommand the intellectual respect of the race, there must be another form\nof teaching yet than this, a teaching which presents Christ in the\nhistoric and philosophic setting: the central Figure in a great body of\nassociated spiritual truth; Christ as the fulfilment of prophecy, the\nmeans of social adjustment and regeneration; the Finisher of our Faith,\nand the Source of eternal joy. We must be, not less spiritual\nChristians, but increasingly intellectual ones, as time rolls on.\n\nWho are the men who have built up doctrine? Men speak as if doctrine\nwere an ecclesiastical toy--to be shaken by priest or prelate, as one\nshakes a rattle, for noise, for play! A doctrine is not a toy; it is the\ncrystallized belief of earnest, thoughtful, and godly men--belief which\nhas passed into a church tradition, and is now received as an act\nof faith.\n\nShall doctrine be taught a child? Yes! To have a specific doctrine\nclearly in mind does not fetter the young soul, any more than to be\ntaught the apparent facts of geography and history, which may change\neither in reality or in his own interpretation as his mind matures. A\ndoctrine is a practical and definite thing to work with; in later life\nto believe, and to approve of, or disbelieve, and disapprove of. If a\nman wishes to build a house, does it fetter him to know square measure,\ncubic contents, geometry, mensuration, and mechanical laws? Yet when he\nbuilds his house, he builds it in his own individual way; he stamps it\nwith his own personality and ideas. While building it, perchance, he\ndiscovers some new relation or geometric law.\n\nDoctrine does not save from hell, but it does save from many a snare\nthat besets the feet of man. It is a steadier of life, a strengthener of\nhope, a stalwart aid to a practical, devout, and duty-doing life. A\ncatechism is a system of doctrine expressed in its simplest form.\nTherefore, for the intellectual and moral training of the Church, let us\nhave sound doctrine in the pulpit, and the catechism in the home and\nSabbath-school.\n\nIt is objected that doctrinal terminology is too hard for a child to\nunderstand. Is this not absurd, when the same child can come home from\nschool and talk glibly of a parallelepipedon, a rhombus, rhomboid,\npolyhedral angle, archipelago, law of primogeniture, the binomial\ntheorem, and of a dicotyledon! He also learns French, German, Latin,\nGreek, and the _argot_ of the public school!\n\nThe theological leader of to-day cannot be a creed-monger: he must be a\ncreed-maker. Side by side with the executive officers who will\nreorganize the Christian forces, there will stand great creed-makers,\ngiant theologians, firm, logical, scientific, and convincing, who, out\nof the vast array of new facts brought forth by modern science, will\nproduce new creeds, a new catechism, a new dogmatic series. It is worth\nwhile to live in these days--to know the possibility of such monumental\nconstructive work in one's own lifetime. The creed-makers must have a\nthorough literary training; no mere vocabulary of philosophy will\nanswer. Like the Elizabethan divines, they must rule the living word,\nwhich shall echo for a century yet to come.\n\nAs the great Ecumenical Council was convened for missionary progress, so\nthe times are now ripe for the assembling of a historic Theological\nCouncil, to revise and restate, not one denominational catechism, but\nthe creed of Christendom; to provide a new literary expression of the\nChristian faith. Together we are working in God's world, and for\nHis kingdom.\n\nIf doctrine be the crystallized thought and belief of godly men, what is\nheresy? What is schism? Who is dictator of doctrine? How far are the\nlimits of authority to be pressed? What are the bounds of ecclesiastical\ncontrol? of intellectual mandate in the Christian Church?\n\nIn the academic world, we do not cast a man out of his mathematical\nchair because he can also work in astro-physics or in <DW43>-physics. If\nhe can pursue advanced research in an allied or applied field, it will\nhelp him in his regular and prescribed work. We do not cast an English\nprofessor out of his chair, because he announces that there are two\nmanuscripts of Layamon's _Brut_, and that the text of Beowulf has been\nmany times worked over, before we have received it in its present form.\nYet there are accredited professors of English who do not know these\nfacts, and who, if called upon, could neither prove them nor disprove\nthem. They have not worked in the Bodleian, in the British Museum, or in\nother foreign libraries, on Old English texts and authorities. They\nthink themselves well up in Old English if they can translate the text\nof Beowulf fairly well, remember its most difficult vocabulary, and can\ntell a tale or two from the _Brut_.\n\nNot every man has Europe or Asia in his backyard, nor a lifetime of\nleisure for research, for special learning, on the moot questions of\nchurch-scholarship. Progress consists in each man's doing his best to\nadvance the interests of the kingdom of God in his own special sphere.\nFrom others he must take something for granted. The ear of the Church\nought always to be open to the sayings of the specialist. A Church\nshould grant liberty of research, of thought, of speech--to a degree.\n\nBut whatever may come out of twentieth-century or thirtieth-century\ncombats, one thing remains clear: A Church is an organization, a social\nbody, with a certain doctrine to proclaim, a certain faith to hand down\nto men. The doctrine is not in all details final--each phase of faith\nmay change. But the organization, to protect its own purity and\nintegrity--however generous in allowing individual research, and the\nexpression of individual ideas--must exert authority over the teachers\nin her midst, those who are called by her name, who have her children in\ntheir charge, and for whose teaching the Church, as a whole, is\nresponsible. There is doubtless a time when the man who is really in\nadvance of his times intellectually must be misunderstood, must be\ndisagreed with, must be cast out. But all truth may await the verdict of\ntime. If he has discovered something new, something true, the centuries\nwill make it plain. There remains a chance--and the Church dare not risk\ntoo great a chance--that he is mistaken, impious, presumptuous, or\nself-deceived. We dare not rush to a new doctrine or spiritual\nconception, merely because one man, who knows more of a certain kind of\nlearning than we do, has said so. One must be bolstered up by a\ngeneration of convinced and believing men, before he can draw a Church\nafter him. No other process is intellectually legitimate. In any other\nevent ecclesiastical anarchy would reign. To maintain the historic\nposition of the Church is a necessity, until that position is proven\nuntrue. So to maintain it is not bigotry, it is not lack of charity; it\nis merely common-sense.\n\nThe question, Where is the line between ecclesiastical integrity and\nindividual freedom? is therefore one which the common-sense of\nChristendom is left to solve--not to-day, not to-morrow, but gradually,\ngenerously, and conscientiously, as the centuries go on.\n\n\nTHIRD: OBSTACLES AND OPPORTUNITY\n\nIt is said that a minister is greatly handicapped to-day in all his\nefforts for two reasons: First, that the times are spiritually\nlethargic, that men are so engrossed by material aims, indifference, or\nsin that a pastor can get no hold upon their hearts. Second, that he is\nbound hand and foot by conditions existing in the organization and\npersonnel of his church, and hence is not free to act.\n\nWhat would we think of an electrician who would complain that a storm\nhad cast down his network of wires? Of a civil engineer who would lament\nthat the mountain over which he was asked to project a road was steep?\nOf a doctor who would grieve that hosts of people about him were very\nill? Of a statesman who would cry out that horrid folks opposed him? It\nis the work of the specialist to meet emergencies, and it is his\nprofessional pride to triumph over difficult conditions. The harder his\ntask, the more he exults in his power of success.\n\nIt is a glorious task that lies before the minister of to-day--to\nmaintain, develop, and uplift the spiritual life of the most wonderful\nepoch of the world's history; to place upon human souls that vital\ntouch that shall hold their powers subject to eternal influences and\naims. The times are not wholly unfavorable: our era, which spurns many\necclesiastical forms, is at heart essentially religious. _The World for\nChrist!_ How this war-cry of the spirit thrills anew as one realizes how\nmuch more there is to win to-day than ever before. The Warrior girds\nhimself and longs eagerly to marshal great, shining, active hosts\nfor God!\n\nIt is true that the conditions of work are more trying than they have\nusually been. A man goes out from the seminary. He has had a good\neducation, followed by perhaps a year or two abroad, and some practical\nexperience in sociological work. He has plans, ideas, ideals, a vigorous\nand whole-souled personality, a frank and generous heart.\n\nWhat does he find? He soon discovers that the battle is not always to\nthe strong, the educated, or the well-bred. Too often he is at the mercy\nof rich men who can scarcely put together a grammatical sentence; of\npoorer men who are, in church affairs, unscrupulous politicians; of\nwomen who carp and gossip; and of all sorts of men and women who desire\nto rule, criticise, hinder, and distrain. They, too, are the very people\nwho, in the ears of God and of the community, have vowed to love him and\nto uphold his work! The more intellectual and spiritual he is, the more\nhe is troubled and distressed.\n\nMany churches, too, are in a chronic state of internal war. As for\nthese rising church difficulties--try to put out a burning bunch of\nfire-crackers with one finger, and you have the sort of task he has in\nhand. While one point of explosion is being firmly suppressed, other\ncrackers are spitting and going off. Whichever way he turns, and\nwhatever he does, something pops angrily, and a new blaze begins! And\nthis business, incredibly petty as it is, blocks the progress of the\nChristian faith. Men and women of education and refinement, of a wide\noutlook and noble thoughts and deeds, are more and more unwilling to\nplace themselves on the church-roll; a minister sometimes finds himself\nin the anomalous position of having the more cultured, congenial, and\nphilanthropic people of the community quite outside any church\norganization.\n\nAll these things mean, not that a minister must grow discouraged, but\nthat he must set his teeth, and with pluck and endurance rise strong and\nmasterful and say, This shall not be! Let him not listen to the barking\nand baying: let him hearken to the great primal voices of man and\nnature. Love lies deeper than discord. The constructive forces of\nhumanity are stronger than the disintegrative. The right\nattraction binds.\n\nThere are some men who by the sheer force of their personality subdue\ntheir church difficulties. They hold the captious in awe. By a sort of\nmagnetic persuasion and lively sense of humor they soothe this one and\nthat, win the regard of the outlying community, attach many new members\nto the organization, and build up, out of discordant and erstwhile\ndiscontented elements, a harmonious and active church. This is the man\nfor these martial times! If there are born leaders in every other\ndepartment of the world's work, men who quietly but firmly assert their\nauthority and supremacy in the tasks in which they hold, by free\nelection or legitimate appointment, a place at the head--it ought to be\nso in the Church of God! I long to see arise in the ministry _a race\nof iron!_\n\nThere are other difficulties, seldom spoken of, of which one must write\nfrankly, though with the keenest sympathy, if one is to look deeply into\nthe modern church problem. First: Is a minister's environment favorable\nto his best personal development? Does he not miss much from the lack of\nthe world's hearty give-and-take? He gets criticism, but not of a just\nor all-round kind. Small things may be pecked at, trifles may be made\nmountains of by the disgruntled, but where does he get a clear-sighted,\nwhole-hearted estimate of himself and his work? Who tells him of his\nreal virtues, his real faults? Among all his friends, who is there, man\nor woman, who is brave enough to be true?\n\nOther men are soon shaken into place. Their personal traits continually\nundergo a process of chiselling and adjustment. They are told\nuncomfortable things how quickly! At the club, in the university, in\nthe market, the ploughing-field, the counting-room, they rub up against\neach other, and no mercy is shown by man to man until primary signs of\ncrudeness are worn off. Let a conceited professor get in a college\nchair! Watch a hundred students begin their delightful and salutary\nprocess of \"taking him down\" by the sort of mirth in which college boys\nexcel! Their unkindness is not right, but the result is, they never\nmolest a man who is merely eccentric.\n\nWatch a scientific association jump with all fours upon a man who has\njust read a paper before their body! How unsparingly they analyze and\ncriticise! He has to meet questions, opposition, comments, shafts of wit\nand envy, jovial teasing and correction. He goes out from the meeting\nwith a keener love of truth and exactness, and a less exalted idea of\nhis own powers. Watch the rivalry and sparring that go on in any\nbusiness. Men meet men who attack them; they fight and overcome them, or\nare themselves overcome.\n\nHuman friction is not always harmful. A minister should not be hurt or\nangered by disagreement and discussion. No one's ideas are final. Let\nhim expect to stand in the very midst of a high-strung, spirited, and\nhard-working generation. Let him be turned out of doors. Let him travel,\nlook, learn, meet men and women, and conquer in the arena of manhood.\nThen, by means of this undaunted manhood, he may the better guide the\nfiery enthusiasms of men, inspire their higher ambitions, and comfort\nthem in their bitter human sorrows!\n\nAgain, too often a minister is spoiled in his first charge by flattery,\npolite lies, and gushing women. He is sadly overpraised. A bright young\nfellow comes from the seminary. He can preach; that is, he can prepare\ninteresting essays, chiefly of a literary sort, which are pleasant to\nlisten to, though, in the nature of things, they can have scarcely a\nword in them of that deep, life-giving experience and counsel which come\nfrom the hearts of men and women who have lived, and know the truth of\nlife. He is told that these sermons are \"lovely,\" \"beautiful,\" \"_so_\ninspiring,\" and he believes every word of praise. No one says to him,\n\"When you know more, you will preach better,\" and his standard of\nexcellence does not advance. This man, who might have become a great\npreacher, remains, as years go on, alas! an intellectual potterer.\n\nHe is also socially made too much of, being one of the very few men\navailable for golf and afternoon teas, suppers, picnics, tennis,\ncharity-bazaars. Other men are frankly too busy for much of these\nthings, except for healthful recreation; and not infrequently one finds\nstray ministers absolutely the only men at some function to which men\nhave been invited.\n\nA minister is not a parlor-pet. How many a time an energetic man,\nsociety-bound, must long to kick over a few afternoon tea-tables, and\nsmash his way out through bric-a-brac and chit-chat to freedom\nand power!\n\nI should think that a real Man in the ministry would get so very tired\nof women! They tell him all their complaints and difficulties, from\nheadaches, servants, and unruly children, to their sentimental\nexperiences and their spiritual problems. Men tell him almost nothing.\nWatch any group of men talking, as the minister comes in. A moment\nbefore they were eager, alert, argumentative. Now they are polite or\nmildly bored. He is not of their world. Some assert that he is not even\nof their sex! Hence the lips of men are too often sealed to the\nminister. He must find some way not only to meet them as brother to\nbrother, but he must capture their inmost hearts. The shy confidence of\nan honorable man once won, his friendship never fails.\n\nThe question of a minister's relation to the women of his congregation\nand the community is not only curious and complex--it is a perpetual\ncomedy. How do other men in public life deal with this problem? They\nhave a genial but indifferent dignity, quite compatible with courtesy\nand friendly ways. They shoulder responsibility; they do not flirt; they\nsort out cranks; they flee from simpers; they put down presumption. If\nmarried, they laugh heartily with their wives over any letter or\nepisode that is comical or sentimental. If not married, they get out of\nthings the best way they know how, with a sort of plain, manly\ndirectness. If a minister would arrogate to himself his free-born\nprivilege of being a thorough-going man, many of his troubles would\ndisappear.\n\nLet him hold himself firmly aloof both from nonsense and from enervating\npraise. Let him dream of great themes, and work for great things! Let\nhim rely on more quiet friends who watch loyally, hope, encourage,\ninspire. By and by the scales drop from his eyes; he sees himself, not\nas one who has already achieved, but as one to whom the radiant gates of\nlife are opening, so that he, too, can one day speak to human souls as\nthe masters have done! He discovers that out of the heart's depths is\ngreat work born! This is a memorable day, both for this man and for his\nchurch. From that hour he has vision and power.\n\nAnother error in ministerial education and outlook is that too often\nministers forget that they compete with other men: they are not an\nisolated class of humanity. Competition underlies the energy and\nefficiency of the world's work. When men do not consciously compete with\nothers, they inevitably drop behind. What a minister was intended for,\nwas to stand head and shoulders above other men. God seems to have\nplanned the universe in such a way that everywhere the spiritual shall\nbe supreme. He was meant to be a towering leader. Who, in other realms,\nhas excelled Moses, Joshua, Elijah, David, Paul?\n\nBut if we consider the responsibilities which are now being laid upon\ndifferent classes of people, and carried by them, I think that we must\nacknowledge that the statesman is looming up as the most influential and\nupbuilding man to-day. He is the one who is adjusting the new\nworld-powers and the new world-relations, over-seeing the development of\nour country, and planning for its laws and commerce. Close to him comes\nthe physician, who is laying his hand on world-plagues, and is studying\nthe conditions and the forms of disease, with a view to striking disease\nat its root. The hand of the doctor is laid upon consumption, malaria,\nyellow fever, diphtheria, typhoid fever, and bubonic plague, and the\nadvance in medical research is marvellous.\n\nThe lawyer and the capitalist are together adjusting the industrial\nrelations of the country. We have trusts, syndicates, and\ncorporation-problems handled with a firm intellectual grasp and a wide\noutlook over human affairs.\n\nThe reading of the world is in the hands of editors of enterprise and\nsagacity. They daily bring wars, statecraft, business plans, political\nsituations, trade openings, scientific discoveries, forms of church-work\nand philanthropy, accidents, murders, and marriages, to our\nbreakfast-table. The press of to-day has a tremendous scope. When some\nof the magazines come to hand, one feels that he is in touch with the\naffairs of the universe and has reading of a cosmic order.\n\nThe day-laborer is discovering that to ingenuity, talent, and manliness,\nthe whole world swings open. Carnegie's Thirty Partners, most of whom\nhave come from the working-ranks, demonstrate that a man can rise from\nthe pick, the spade, the foreman's duties, to the control of great\nindustrial interests.\n\nBankers are thinking out the financial problems--currency, legal tender,\nthe best forms of money and authority; the whole monetary system of the\nworld is under consideration and analysis. The farmer is learning,\nthrough chemistry and other forms of science, new ways of making his\nfarm productive, and the educated agriculturist is rising to be an\nintellectual factor in the development of our country. Everywhere we see\nLife awakening--a great renaissance!\n\nHas the minister, as a thinker and active force of regeneration, kept\npace with this advance? Do many sermons thrill us in this large way?\nWhere does he rank among the world-masters of energy and power?\n\nThe ministry is supposed to be a work of saving souls. But if we could\nknow the direct effect of preaching, and the conversions which are\nreally due to preaching, I think we should find them comparatively few.\nWhat touched the boy or girl, man or woman, and led him or her to Christ\nwas not the sermon, or pastoral talk, though this one or another may\nhave united with the Church after a special sermon, revival, or personal\nappeal. It was the memory and influence of a mother's prayers; of early\nassociations; of a teacher, a lover, a friend. The conversion came\ndirect from God--the soul was acted upon by some special moving of the\nHoly Spirit. Or it was the death of a friend, an illness, an accident, a\ndisappointment, which turned the thoughts to heavenly things. Or it was\na book that searched the soul's depths, or some quickening human\nexperience. Is this quite as it should be? Is not professional\npride aroused?\n\nSuppose that New York City should suddenly be invaded by the bubonic\nplague or yellow fever. Would any one be to blame? Certainly! Such an\noutcry would go up as would echo across the country. Where were the\nquarantine officers? Where was the port physician? Where were the\nspecialists who attend to sanitation and disinfection?\n\nWe say that divorce and Sabbath-breaking are sweeping over our\ncountry--gambling, social drinking, and many other ills; a sensational\npress, a corrupt politics, a materialistic greed.\n\nAll the ministers under heaven cannot take sin out of the world, nor\nuproot sin altogether from the heart of man: the plague conies in at\nbirth. Neither can all the doctors living remove disease, so that no one\nwill get sick or die. But just as the doctor can, by study, by training,\nby counsel, by practice, and by the direction of wise law-making,\nprotect the health interests of his country or community, so the\nminister should stand, yet more largely than to-day, as a break-water\nbetween the world and the tides of sin! He should not only be able to\nkeep alive in a country an atmosphere of prayer, devotion, and unselfish\nservice--he should, by God's help, make piety the general estate of the\nland; he should not only be intellectually able to show the great\nadvantage of the upright Christian life, he should straight-way lead\nall classes into that life; he should be able to lay a hand on the moral\nmaladies of mankind, personal and national, and prescribe effectual\nremedies; take lame, halt, sinning souls, and by God's grace and Spirit,\nlift not only individuals, but whole communities, to a more\nspiritual plane.\n\nThis is a Titanic intellectual task, as well as a spiritual one. When a\ndoctor wishes to keep plague out of America, he goes to Asia, to see\nwhat plague is! He takes microscopes, instruments, and drugs; he buries\nhimself in a laboratory, and gives his whole mind to the problem, until\none day he can come forth and tell how to heal and help. More than this,\nhe risks his life. For every great discovery in medical practice,\ndoctors and nurses have died martyrs to their faithful work.\n\nMoral evil must be studied in an energetic and intellectual way. The\nvariations of humanity from righteousness must be deeply understood.\nLook at Booker T. Washington, or at Jacob A. Riis! What daring, what\nindefatigable toil, what insight, patience, and swerveless hope have\nbeen put into their task! Edison is said to have spent six months\nhissing S into his phonograph to make it repeat that letter, and many\ndays he worked seventeen hours a day. Have many ministers ever bent\nthemselves in this way to solve a special moral problem--that of, say, a\ndisobedient child in the congregation? Have they spent six months, hours\nand hours a day, to make the law of God, the word Obedience, ring in\nthat child's ears? Spiritual guidance is definitely and positively a\nscientific task. The mastery of one fact may lead to the correlation of\na psychic law. When a minister can help a soul to overcome temptation,\nand a parent to bring up a child, he is in touch with two final human\nproblems. As he gradually enlarges his careful and illuminating work,\nhis church becomes in time a body of spiritually well-educated\ncommunicants, thoroughly grounded in doctrinal, ethical, and social\nideals, well taught in public and in private duties. It is not\nself-centred or wholly denominational in spirit, but recognizes itself\nto be a part of a catholic body of believers, reaches out with friendly\ncooeperation to near-by churches, extends its missionary efforts to\nother neighborhoods or lands, and partakes of a world-life, a\nworld-love!\n\nRuling religious thinkers should also, by and by, become leaders of\nnational thought and life. Great public questions should be open to\ntheir judgment and appeal; they should be moral arbiters, and spiritual\nguides in national crises. By a word they should be able to rouse the\nprayers of the country, and by a word to still widespread anger and\nuprising. If accredited spiritual leaders cannot help, who can?\n\nThere are a few men living who seem to hold, for the whole world, the\ntemporal balance. They control mines and shipping, banks and trade. Who,\nto-day, holds the spiritual destiny of the world in his hand? I long to\nsee men appear upon whom the eyes of the world shall be fastened, in\nrecognition of their spiritual preeminence, as they are now fastened on\nthese industrial giants.\n\nRise! Let some man, earnest and endowed, look forward into the future,\nand with the courage that comes from inborn power, assert himself among\nthe nations! Allay, O World-Evangelist, not only neighborhood disputes,\nbut international dissensions; project a creed that shall be profound\nand universal; sweep sects together, unite energy and endeavor, baptize\nwith fire, bring repentance, quicken the race-conscience, uplift the\nWorld-Hope! Erect and elemental, hold CHRIST before the race!\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE WORLD-MARCH: OF SAGES\n\n     [ADESTE FIDELES]\n\n     _Our Father in Heaven,\n       Creator of all,\n     O source of all wisdom,\n       On Thee we would call!\n     Thou only canst teach us,\n       And show us our need,\n     And give to Thy children\n       True knowledge indeed.\n\n     But vain our instruction,\n       And blind we must be,\n     Unless with our learning\n       Be knowledge of Thee.\n     Then pour forth Thy Spirit\n       And open our eyes,\n     And fill with the knowledge\n       That only makes wise.\n\n     From pride and presumption,\n       O Lord, keep us free,\n     And make our hearts humble,\n       And loyal to Thee,\n     That living or dying,\n       In Thee we may rest,\n     And prove to the scornful\n       Thy statutes are best._\n\n     THOMAS WISTAR\n\nIf we should be told that at birth a strange and wonderful gift had\nbeen bestowed upon us, one such that by means of it, in after life, we\ncould accomplish almost anything we wished, how we should guard it! With\nwhat delight we would make it work, to see what it would do! We should\nnever be tired of such a toy, because every day it would reveal new\npossibilities of power and delight.\n\nSuch a gift God has given us in our power to think. What a mysterious\nand deep-hid gift it is! Nerves and sensations, a few convolutions in\nthe brain, acts of attention and observation, certain reactions\nfollowing certain stimuli: the result, a world of worlds spread out\nbefore us; unlimited intellectual possibilities within our grasp!\n\nWhat is thinking? Thinking is an attempt to express infinite thoughts,\naffections, relations, and events, in finite terms. The child strings\nbuttons. The philosopher strings God, angels, devils, brutes, men, and\ntheir appurtenances and deeds. Hence no real thought will quite go into\nwords. Out beyond the word hangs the infinite remainder of our idea. The\nsearch for a vocabulary is the search for a clearer articulation\nof ideas.\n\nThinking is the power to take up life where the race has left off\nattainment, and to lead the race one step farther on, by a new concept\nor idea. It is a curious thing, this little turn in the brain, a\nthought. We cannot see it, or touch it, or handle it. Yet we can give\nit, one to another, or one man to the race. It has an infinite leverage.\nOne great thought moves millions onward. Plant the word _steam_, and\nglobe-transport changes. Plant _electricity_, and a hundred new\nindustries spring up. Plant _liberty_, tyrants fall. Plant _love_,\nchaotic angers disappear.\n\nIf we refuse to learn to think, we refuse to do our share of the world's\nwork. We are like a horse that balks and will not pull. While we sulk\nthe universe is at a standstill.\n\nSpelling and arithmetic, history, etymology, and geography, are not\ntasks set over school-children by a hard taskmaster, who keeps them from\nsunshine and out-of-door play. They are catch-words of the universe.\nThey are the implements by which each brain is to be trained to do great\nwork for the one in whom it lives. What every earnest soul asks is not\ngold, fame, or pleasure. It is: Let me not die till I have brought\nmillions farther on.\n\nWe cannot deliberately make thoughts. Thought is like life itself:\nscience has not found a formula which will produce it. But just as\nmarriage produces new lives, though we cannot say how, so study and\nmeditation produce thoughts. Something new appears: a concept which was\nnot with the race before.\n\nThe work of sages has been to rule the thinking of the race. They\nreceive the inspired ideas and spend their lives in teaching them to\nothers: in setting up intellectual vibrations throughout the world.\n\nSome day, I hope Sargent will paint a March of Sages, as gloriously as\nhe has painted the panels of the Prophets. Then we shall gaze upon the\ntrain of heavy-browed, noble-eyed, wise, gentle-mannered men, who have\nbeen the enduring teachers of the race,--thinkers, leaders, seers.\nConfucius, Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, the mediaeval\nphilosophers, the Egyptian, Persian, and Arabian thinkers, Roger Bacon,\nThomas Aquinas, Eckhart, William of Occam, Bede, Thomas a Kempis,\nFrancis Bacon, Kant, John Stuart Mill, Spencer,--with what dignity the\nprocessional moves down the years! The sum of human knowledge is vast;\nbut how much more vast seem the achievements of each of these men, when\nwe realize how few his years, and how many the obstacles and impediments\nof his all too short career! There is ever a pathos in the life of\nthe wise.\n\nBy thinking, we pass from the gossip of the neighborhood into the\nconversation of the years. We do not know what Alcibiades said to his\nman-servant about the care of his clothes, baths, perfumes,--nor what\nhis man-servant retailed to other retainers of the eccentricities and\nvanities of his master. But we know what Pericles and Plato said to the\nrace. Here is the advantage of a thinking mind--that at any moment one\nmay enter into eternal subjects of thought, and have converse with those\nwho of all times have been the most profound.\n\nNothing teases the soul like the thought of the unfinished, the\nimperfect, the incomplete. And yet, when we have thought and planned a\nreally great and abiding work, whether we ever finish it or not--for\nmany things in life may intervene between conception and completion--to\nhave thought of it is to have had in our lives a pleasure that can never\ndie. For one blessed hour or year we have been lifted to the thoughts of\nGod and have entered into the great original Design. Hence it is that\nthe life of the real Thinker, however broken or disturbed, is at heart a\nlife of serenity and joy. What matters a conflagration, a\ndisappointment, to him whose thoughts are set upon the race?\n\nThinking is a form of vital growth. We all wish for growth. Is there any\none who wishes to stay always just where he is to-day? To be always what\nhe is this morning? The tree grows, the flower grows, the ideals of the\nrace grow--shall not I?\n\nWe are born to a destiny which has no limit of grandeur save the limit\nof the thought of God, The wish for growth is the wish to enter into the\nspiritual ideals of the universe,--to become one with its advancement,\none with its decrees.\n\nBut do not the secular look upon growth as a sort of chase--a chase for\nmore learning, more money, a bigger business, a higher degree, a better\nposition, a brilliant marriage,--a struggle for wealth, renown, acclaim?\nThese things are not in themselves growth, nor its real index. Growth is\nnot a form of avarice. Growth is a vital state of being. Growth is the\nassimilation of experience. Growth is development in the line of eternal\npurpose. Growth is the combination of our souls with the things that\nare, in such a way as to make a perpetual progress toward the things\nthat are to be.\n\nWe lose much because we lose avidity out of our lives, the eagerness to\ngrasp what spiritually belongs to us,--to share the universal\nenthusiasm, the universal hope. Day by day the world wheels about\nus--sunset and moonrise, wind, hail, frost, snow, vapor, care, anxiety,\ntemptation, trial, joy, fear. Whatever touches the sense or the soul is\nsomething by which, rightly used, we may grow. There is nothing we need\nfear to take into our lives, if it receives the right assimilation. Each\nexperience is meant to be a vital accession. We narrow our lives and\nenfeeble our powers when we try to reject any of these things, or\nunlawfully escape them, or are yet indifferent to them. Prejudice,\ncowardice, and apathy are death.\n\nExperience is what the race has been through. Each of us has his\npersonal variant of this common life. Thought is the power by which we\nmake it available for our own better living, and the future life of\nthe race.\n\nTo the early man, there existed earth, air, water, fire, heat, cold,\ntempest, and the growth of living things. He lived, ate, fought, but his\nthoughts were primitive and personal. Have _I_ had enough dinner? he\nasked, not, Is the race fed?\n\nBy and by some one arose who began to consider things in the abstract,\nand to relate them to his neighbor, and formulate conclusions about\nthem. He was the first real Thinker, Then air-philosophy and\nelement-philosophy grew up--beast-worship, animalism, fire-worship, and\nthe rudiments of simple scientific learning, as, for instance, when men\nfound that they could make a tool to cut, a spike to sew.\n\nSince then, what the sage has done is to teach men to see, read, write,\nthink, count, and to work; to love ideals, to love mankind and relate\nhis work to human progress.\n\nMan's first primer was near at hand. When he wished to write, he made a\npicture with a stick, a stone, on a leaf, or traced his idea in the mud.\nWhen he wanted to count, he kept tally on his fingers, or with pebbles\nfrom the beach or brook. When he wished to communicate an idea orally,\nit was with glances, shrugs, gestures, and imitative sounds. Once, in a\ngame of Twenty Questions, this was the question set to guess: Who first\nused the prehistoric root expressing a verb of action? Who, indeed?\n\nOut of that leaf-writing, and bark-etching, and later rune, have grown\nthe printed writings of mankind. Homer, Dante, Milton, and Shakespeare\nare the lineal descendants of the man who made holes in a leaf, or lines\non a wave-washed sand. Out of the finger-counting have grown up\nbook-keeping, geometry, mathematical astronomy and a knowledge of the\nhigher curves. Out of the prehistoric shrugs and sounds and grimaces we\nhave oral speech--much of it worthless, and not all of it yet wholly\nintelligible. We are still continually being understood to say what we\nnever meant to say: we are forever putting our private interpretation on\nthe words of other men. Even yet, we are all too stupid. In our\ndreariest moments does there not come to us sometimes a voice which\ncries: Up, awake! Cease blinking, and begin to see!\n\nLanguage is electric. Words have a curious power within themselves. They\nrain upon the heart with the soft memories of centuries of old\nassociations, or thoughts of love, vigils, and patience. They have a\npower of suggestion which goes beyond all that we may dream. Just as a\nman shows in himself traces of a long-dead ancestry, so words have the\npower to revive emotions of past generations and the experiences of\nformer years. The man of letters, the Thinker, strews a handful of\nwords into the air, breathes a little song. The words spring up and\nbring forth fruit. Their seed is human progress and a larger life for\nmen. Think, for instance, who first flung the word _freedom_ into\nspace!--_gravitation, evolution, atom, soul!_ There is no power like the\npower of a word: a word like _liberty_ can dethrone kings.\n\nWe get out of a word just what we put into it, plus the individuality of\nthe man who uses it. Some men read into noble words only their own\nsilliness, vulgarity, prejudice, or preconceived ideas. Another man\nreads with his heart open for new impressions, new insight, new fancies\nand ideals.\n\nWords have not only their inherent meaning; they have their allied\nmeanings. A word may mean one thing by itself. It may mean quite another\nthing when another word stands beside it; even marks of punctuation give\nwords a curiously different sound and shade. Literature is a mastery,\nnot only of the moods of men, but of the moods of words. Corot takes a\nstream, some grass and trees, a flitting patch of sky. By means of a few\nstrokes of his brush, he manages to present that tree, sky, stream, in a\nway which suggests the pastoral experience of the ages. Where did that\nmisty veil come from? the trembling lights and shadows, the half-heard\nsounds and silence of the woods, the changing cloud, the dim reflection,\nthe atmosphere of mystery and peace?\n\nSo each man goes to the dictionary. He takes a word here, a word there,\ncommon words that everybody knows. He puts them together: the result is\na presentation of the life of man, and lays hold of his inmost spirit.\n\n     \"_Our birth is but a deep and a forgetting;\n     The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,\n        Hath had elsewhere its setting\n           And cometh from afar;\n        Not in entire forgetfulness,\n        And not in utter nakedness,\n     But trailing clouds of glory do we come\n           From God, who is our home!_\"\n\nTo write, the soul chooses, and God stands ever by to help. That is why\ngreat work always impresses us as inspired. God did it. It is God who\nwhispers the deathless thought and phrase: the subtler collocations\nare divine.\n\nTake the word _star_. To the child it means a bright point that glitters\nand twinkles in the sky, and sets him saying an old nursery rhyme. To\nthe youth or maiden it suggests love, romance, a summer eve, or a frosty\nwalk under the friendly winter sky. To the rhetorician it suggests a\nfigure of speech--the star of hope. To the mariner it suggests guidance\nand the homeward port. To the astronomer it means the world in which he\nlives. His life is centred in that star. To the poet it means all these\nthings and many more. For the poet is the one who, in his own heart,\nholds all the meanings that words hold for the race. Read again the\nlines just quoted, and think of Wordsworth's outlook on the star!\n\nThe dictionary definition of a word can seldom be the real one, nor does\nit reveal the deeper sense it has. It blazes a path for the\nunderstanding, but individual thought must follow. Take the words _time,\nfriendship, work, play, heroism_. It took Carlyle to define Time for us.\nEmerson has defined Friendship. Let the lights and shadows of the\nthought of Carlyle and Emerson play upon these words, they are at once\nremoved from mechanical definition, and we dimly perceive that each word\nis larger than the outreach of the thought of man. Another generation\nthan ours shall define and refine them. In heaven, in some other aeon,\nwe shall find out what they really mean!\n\nThus knowledge is not permanent. It reels. It proceeds, it changes, it\nis iridescent with new significance from day to day.\n\nWhat is true of a word, and what we make of it, is true of every phase\nof learning. The black-board is not all. Learning is not tied to it, or\nto any one person, demonstration, interpretation, event, or epoch. No\nwise man can keep his learning to himself, and yet he cannot, though he\nteach a thousand years, transmit his deeper learning to another. The\natmosphere, the casual information, the spiritual magnetism of a great\nman, will teach better than the text-books, the lecture courses, and\nthe formal resources of academic halls. Thus Mark Hopkins is in himself\na university, given a boy on the other end of the log on which he sits.\n\nIt is the relativity of knowledge that dances before the eye, that\nbewilders, eludes, evades. Group-systems and electives seem like a\nmakeshift for the real thing. We cannot tie a fact to a pupil, because\nto the tail of the fact is tied history itself. Until a pupil gets a\nglimpse of that relation, that dependence of which we have just heard,\nwith all that has yet happened in connection with it, he is not yet\nquite master of his fact. He recites glibly the date of Thermopylae, and\ndoes not know that all Greece is trailing behind his desk. When, after\nsubsequent research, he knows something of Greece, he discovers Greece\nto be dovetailed into Rome and Egypt, and they lay hold upon the plain\nof Shinar and Eden, and the immemorial, prehistoric years.\n\nAh, no! We never really know. Every fact recedes from us, as might an\nebbing wave, and leaves us stranded upon an unhorizoned beach, more\ndespairing than before. Education does not solve the problems of\nlife--it deepens the mystery. What, then, may the sage know? Are there\nno sages? And have we all been misinformed?\n\nA sage is one who knows what, in his position of life, is most necessary\nfor him to know. The larger sage, the great Sage, is the one who knows\nwhat is necessary for the race to know.\n\nIt is a wrong idea of wisdom, that we must necessarily know what some\none else knows. Wisdom is single-track for each man. There are in the\nworld those who know how to build aqueducts, and to bake _charlotte\nrusse_, and to sew trousers. Aqueducts and tailor work may be alike out\nof my individual and personal knowledge, yet I may not necessarily be an\nignorant man. The primitive hunter stood in the forest. For him to be a\nhunting-sage, was to know the weather, traps, weapons, the times, and\nthe lairs and ways of beasts. He knew lions and monkeys, the coiled\nserpent and the serpent that hissed by the ruined wall; the ways of the\nwolf, the jackal, and the kite; the manners of the bear and the black\npanther in the jungle-wilds. Kipling is the brother of that early man:\nhe is a forest-sage, and would have held his own in other times.\n\nThe sea-sage was the one who could toss upon the swan-road without fear.\nHe knew the strength of oak and ash; the swing of oar, the curve of\nprow, the dash of wave, and the curling breaker's sweep. He knew the\nmaelstroms and the aegir that swept into northern fiords; the thunder\nand wind and tempest; the coves, safe harbors and retreats. To-day, the\nsea-sage rules the fishing-boat, the ocean liner, the coastwise\nsteamers, and the lake-lines of the world.\n\nThe fishing-sage knows the ways and haunts of fish. He is wise in the\nsalmon, the perch, the trout, the tarpon, and the muscalonge. He says.\nTo-day the bass will bite on dobsons, but to-morrow we must have frogs.\n\nNo sagacity is universal, but the love of sagacity may be. The man who\nstarts out to implant a new way of education has a noble task before\nhim, but is it a final one, or even a more than tolerably practical one?\nIs there such a thing as a place for Truth at wholesale, even in an\nacademy or college? Can a man receive an education outside of himself?\nHe may be played upon by grammars and by loci-paper, by electrical\nmachines, and parsing tables and Grecian accents, by the names of noted\nauthors and statesmen, and the thrill of historic battles and decisions.\nHe may be placed under a rain of ethical and philosophic ideas, and may\nbe forced to put on a System of Thought, as men put on a mackintosh. But\nhis true education is what he makes of these things. If he hears of\nTheodoric with a yawn, we say--the college-folk--He must be imbecile.\nNo, not imbecile! he may become a successful toreador, or snake-charmer,\nwhich things are out of our line! And a man may be an upright citizen, a\ngood husband, and a sincerely religious man, who has never heard of\nFrancesca, nor Fra Angelico, nor named the name of Botticelli!\n\nThe moment we set bounds to wisdom, we find that we have shut something\nout. Wisdom is the free, active life of a growing and attaching soul.\nWe must not only attach information to ourselves, we must assimilate it.\nElse we are like a crab which should drag about Descartes, or as an\nocean sucker which should hug a copy of Thucydides.\n\nEducation is the taking to one's self, so far as one may in a lifetime,\nall that the race has learned through these six thousand years.\nEducation is not a thing of books alone, or schools; it is a process of\nintellectual assimilation of what is about us, or what we put about\nourselves. At every step we have a choice. This is the real difference\nbetween students at the same school or university. One puts away Greek,\nand the other lays up football and college societies. A third gets all\nthree, being a little more swift and alert. One stows away\ninsubordination--another, order and obedience. One does quiet, original\nwork of reading and research; the other stows away schemes for getting\nthrough recitations and examinations. No two students ever come out of\nthe same school, college, or shop with the same education. Their\ntraining may have been measurably alike, but the result is immeasurably\nunlike. Education, in the last analysis, is getting the highest\nintellectual value out of one's environment and opportunities. There is\na cow-boy philosopher, a kitchen-philosopher, as truly as there is a\nphilosopher of the academic halls.\n\nConduct is the _pons asinorum_ of life. Wise men somehow cross it,\nthough stumblingly, and with tears. Fools, usurers, oppressors, and\nspendthrifts of life are left gaping and wrangling on the hellward side.\nThinkers have always been climbing up on each other's shoulders to look\nover into the Beyond. What they have seen, they have told. Some men\nclimb so high into the ethereal places of the Ideal, that they do not\nget down again. They are the impractical men. An impractical man is not\nnecessarily the educated man; he is the man at the top of some\nintellectual fence, who wishes to come down, but has absent-mindedly\nforgotten that he has legs. The legs are not absent, but his wit is. So\nwith the impractical man in every sphere. Education has not really\nremoved his common-sense, as some say, his power to connect passing\nevents with their causes, and to act reasonably; but it has set his\nthought on some other thought for the time being, and the dinner-bell,\nwe will say, does not detach him from his inquiry. His necktie rides up!\nHe goes out into the street without a hat! Let him alone till he proves\nthe worth of what he is about. The practical man, who hears the\ndinner-bell and prides himself upon this fact, may not hear sounds\nfar-off and clear, that ring in the impractical man's ear, and that may\nsometime tell him how to make a better dinner-bell, or provide a better\ndinner--a great social philosophy--for the race!\n\nThe really impractical man is not he who reaches out to the intellectual\nand ideal aspects of life; it is he who lives as if this life were all.\nThere are women who make pets of their clothes, as men make pets of\nhorse or dog. They have just time enough in life to dress themselves up.\nLooking back over their years, they can only say, I have had clothes! In\nthe same number of years, with no greater advantages or opportunities,\nother women have become the queenly women of the race. Some women are\ngirt with centuries, instead of gold or gems. Whenever they appear, the\nevent becomes historic; what they do adds new lustre to life.\n\nWe are all prodigals. We throw away time and strength, and years, and\ngold, and then weep that we are ignorant, and embeggared at the last.\nWho shall teach us wisdom, and in what manner may we be wise?\n\nWhat say the sages of the vast possibilities of the race? With one voice\nthey say: Be brave! Do not cower, shrink, or whine. Throw out upon the\nworld a free fearlessness of thought and word and deed. Courage,\nfreedom, heroism, faith, exactness, honor, justice, and mercy--these\ntraits have been handed down as the traditional learning of the heart\nof man.\n\nAnother ideal of the race is Law. We have given up a\nchaos-philosophy--the haphazard continuity of events--a cometary orbit,\nfor the world. There are fixed relations everywhere existent: the\nsuccession of cycles is orderly and prearranged.\n\nAnother ideal is Progress. We are moving, not toward the bottom, but\ntoward the top of possibility. We reject annihilation, because then\nthere is nothing left. And there must always be something\nleft--progress--a bigger something, a better something. Should\nannihilation be the truth of things, and all the race mortal, then some\nday there would be a Last Man. And after the Last Man, what? He would\ndie, and then all that any of the other stars could view of the vast\npanorama of our earthly generations would be an unburied corpse, with\nnot even a vulture hovering to pick it to freshness in the air!\n\nA Last Man? No. Instead, the seers have shown us a great multitude in a\nheavenly country, praising God, and singing forth His Name forever.\nImmortality broods over the great thought of the race. All great minds\nlook upward to it: it is the final consummation of our dreams.\n\nAnother ideal is social adjustment, and social service. We must do\nsomething for some one, or we cast current sagacity behind the back.\nPeople crowd each other to the wall. The weak of communities and nations\nare too often crushed. Redress is in the air. The longed-for wisdom of\nto-day shows a kaleidoscopic front, in which are turning the\nslum-dweller and the millionaire; the white man, the yellow, and the\nblack; the town and the territorial possession. The slave-colony,\ngarbage-laws, magistrates, and murderers are mixed in motley, and there\nare whirling vacant-lot schemes abroad, potato-patches, wood-yards,\norganized charity, Wayfarers' Lodges, resounding cries of municipal\nreform, and various other interests of the wisdom-scale.\n\nHence, wisdom has not yet been arrived at: we are still on the run. This\ntwentieth century will find new problems, new queries, new cranks, and\nnew dismays!\n\nOne thing, however, shines out clear: Wisdom is being recognized as\nhaving a moral aspect, and men are looking for a Religion which shall\nsum up the learning of the sages, the information of the race.\n\nWhen we look down into the physical universe, the primary thing that we\nfind there is gravitation. When we look into the moral universe, the\nprimary thing that we find there is also gravitation--a sinking to a\nLower. This is sin--a contrariness of things--which makes the world an\nevil place to live in, instead of a good; which wrecks character and\nstates, eats the hearts out of cultures and civilizations, destroys\nstrong races, leaves a stain upon even the youngest child, and which is\nconstantly drawing the race downward, instead of upward.\n\nSin, sin, sin! Everywhere the fact glares upon us, and cannot be hid, or\nput away. Sin is not an intellectual toy, for philosophers to play with\nor define as \"a limitation of being.\" Sin is a reality, for men to\nfeel, recoil from, and of which one must repent.\n\nSin is energy deliberately misplaced: energy directed against the course\nof things, the infinite development, the will of God. Sin is corruption,\nand desolation, and decay. Death broods over the spirit of man, unless a\nRedeemer come. The unredeemed ages hang over history like a pall. In\nthem there are monumental oppression, cruelties, and crimes. The breath\nof myriad millions went out in darkness, and there was none to save. A\nplague swept over all the race.\n\nHence, even scientifically considered, the final aim of thinking must\nbe, to arrive at some thought which will take hold of this primary fact\nof sin and uproot it; which will show how the world may be purged\nof sin.\n\nSlowly but inevitably we are moving to this great Thought. It is summed\nup in one word: Redemption. The watchword of a century ago was\ngravitation. It explained the poise of the universe by a great and\nhitherto undiscovered law. The watchword of yesterday was evolution. It\nexplains progressive change: the mounting-up of life \"through spires of\nform.\" The forms of the universe are seen in a series which is in the\nmain ascendant, and in which the survivor is supreme. The watchword of\nto-morrow is Redemption. The Thinker will some day live, who will make\nthat great word Redemption stand out in all its vast majesty and\nsignificance. This, I take it, is the work of our new century.\n\nRedemption is the explanation of the existence of man, of his present\nprogress, and his future destiny. It is the great mystery of joy in\nwhich the race partakes; the spiritual culmination of all things\nearthly; the forecast of eternal things yet to be.\n\nRedemption is not a dogma; it is a life. Redemption is a perpetual and\nascendant moral growth. It marks a world-balm, a world-change. It is in\nthe spirit of man that it works, and not in his outer condition, or\nexternal strivings. It is ultimately to root sin out of the world.\n\nThrough stormy sorrows and perpetual desolations comes the race to God.\nZion is the Whole of things--the encompassment of space, and time, and\nendless years,--an environment of immortality and peace.\n\nVirtue leads the race to Joy, and there is no byway to this height. The\nfinal aspect of the universe is joy. Joy is elemental--a vast vibration\nthat sweeps through centuries as years! A day in His courts is as a\nthousand, and a thousand years are as one day, because they thrill with\nan immortal and imperishable emotion. The seraphim and cherubim,\nSandalphon and Azrael, are angels of enduring joy. Joy is the soul's\nshare of the life of God.\n\nThus when the world has breathed to us the holy name of Christ, it has\ntold us the highest that it knows. The March of Sages is toward a\nRedeemer! The banner of Wisdom is furled about the Cross!\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE WORLD-MARCH: OF TRADERS\n\n     [AMSTERDAM]\n\n     _Lo, my soul, look forth abroad\n       And mark the busy stir:\n     Wouldst thou say, in pride and scorn,\n       Our God is not in her!\n     Nay, the bonds, the wares, the coin,--\n       These, in truth, are passing things;\n     Other treasures thrill the life\n       Of earth's great merchant kings!\n\n     We, they say, would wake the power\n       In mountain and in mine;\n     And transport, from sea to sea,\n       The cedar, oak, and pine:\n     Build the bridge, and plant the town,\n       Enter every open mart;\n     Make our nation's commerce flow,--\n       But this is not our heart!\n\n     Many a prayer uplifted springs\n       O'er desk, and din, and roar;\n     Many an humble knee is bent\n       When the rushed day is o'er;\n     Far within, where God may be,\n       All exists His Throne to raise;\n     Every triumph of our power\n       Becomes a form of Praise!\n\n     God of nations, hear our cry,\n       And keep us just and true;\n     Lay Thy hand on all our lives,\n       And bless the work we do:\n     Then from every coast and clime\n       Land and sea shall tribute bring;\n     Gold and traffic, world-domain\n       We offer to our King!_\n\n     ANNA ROBERTSON BROWN LINDSAY\n\nWe are all traders. Each of us is endowed with some faculty, ware, or\npossession which he is constantly exchanging for other things. We trade\ntime, talent, service, goods, acres, produce, counsel, experience,\nideals. The world is in reality a Bourse of Exchange. Each of us brings\nsome day his special product to the common mart.\n\nThere are traders and traders--the just and the unjust--the man of honor\nand the rogue. We set values on thoughts and on transactions, on\nmerchandise and on philanthropies, on ideas and on accounts; and there\nis a constant distribution of the affairs, as well as of the worldly\ngoods of men.\n\nBut in a restricted sense, we think of trade as the exchange of produce\nwhich is material and mobile,--which may be touched, handled, weighed,\ntransported, bought, and sold. The substance of the earth is constantly\ntaking new shape before our eyes, being rearranged in kaleidoscopic\ncombinations, and transported from port to port, from town to town, from\nsea to sea. One can look nowhere without seeing this ceaseless activity\nprogressing. Everywhere there is a whir of wheels, a plash of waves, a\ndin of assembly, as the new combinations take place.\n\nThere was a day when trade was a thing of here-and-there; a thing of\nsailing ships and caravans, of merchants of Bagdad, Cairo, Venice,\nAlexandria, Jerusalem, Tyre, and Damascus. Ivory, gold, gems, precious\nstuffs, teak and cedar wood, Lebanon pine, apes, peacocks, sandal-wood,\ncamel's hair, goat's hair, frankincense, pearl, dyes, myrrh, cassia,\ncinnamon, Balm of Gilead, calamus, spikenard, corn, ebony, figs, fir,\nolives, olive-wood, wheat, amber, copper, lead, tin, and precious stones\nwere the chief articles of exchange. A very little sufficed the poor;\nthe rich were housed in palaces and panoplied in gems.\n\nAs time went on, the processional of traders became a processional led\nout, in turn, by the merchants of one city after another. It is a\npicturesque study, that of the trade-routes of the Middle Ages! There\nwas the Mediterranean seaboard, and there were the Baltic towns and the\nHanse towns; the Portuguese mariners and traders; the Venetian merchant\nprinces. There was the Spanish colonial trade; the Dutch trade of the\nEast Indies; the trade of Amsterdam and London. There were the\nElizabethan sea-rovers. Then came the British trade in the East Indies,\nand the gradual growth of the trade of France, Germany, England, and the\nUnited States. This is a story of human wants reaching out as\ncivilization advanced, and of the extending of the earth-exchange.\nEverywhere there has been a correspondence between national prosperity\nand increasing trade.\n\nTo-day, each man demands more of the earth's products than ever before.\nHe reaches out a hand for comforts and luxuries, as well as for\nnecessities. He grasps not only the produces of his own and his\nneighbor's field and vineyard, but demands what lies across continents\nand seas. Instead of the ship, the camel, and the ass, we now have the\nocean freighter or liner, and the flying train of cars: new forces, oil,\nsteam, electricity, and water-power, do the carrying work of man. And\nhence trade has become Trade, and each trader is involved in the\ncomfort, success, and prosperity of many others. A single commercial\ntransaction to-day involves the lives of hundreds of thousands, competes\nfor their toil and life-blood, carries the decision of their destiny.\n\nA great merchant is the real Kris Kringle. He stands at the centre of\nexchange, distributes from the tropics and the arctic zones. He deals\nout fur and feathers, books, toys, clothing, engines; ribbons, laces,\nsilks, perfumes; bread-stuffs, sugar, cotton, iron, ice, steel; wheat,\nflour, beef, stone; lumber, drugs, coal, leather. He scatters\nperiodically the products of mills and looms, of shoe-shops and\nprint-works, fields, factories, mines, and of art-workers. He thus\nbecomes a social force of great power, a social law-giver, in fact.\nUnder his iron rule, the lives of the masses are uplifted or cast down.\n\nAs large eras open, the ethical ideals become higher. We are beginning\nto inquire, as never before, into the basis of trade, the place of the\ntrader, the right conduct of this vast problem of Distribution upon\nwhich hinges so much of human life and fate. All things look, not only\nto the integration of trade, but to its exaltation.\n\nTrade has ceased to be a thing of individual energy, talent, and\ncommercial alertness. It has risen to great proportions. The large\ntrader is in control of national conduit, as well as of national\nexpense. There is a great deal more in business than the art of making\nmoney. Business is, at the roots, a way of making nations; of developing\nthe resources of a country, of handling its industries, of protecting\nits commerce, of enlarging its institutions, of uplifting its training,\naspirations, and ideals. Traffic is educational. Imports influence the\nnational life. We may import opium or Bibles, whiskey or bread-stuffs,\nlocomotives or dancing pigs.\n\nThe sceptre held by Tyre and Venice is passing into our own hands. But\ntrade, to-day, is a matter of the imagination, as well as of the\nstock-book. 11 needs a great imagination to handle the present-day\nproblems of business and finance. The prosperity of a nation depends\nlargely on the intelligence, integrity, and magnanimity of its business\nmen. To be narrow-minded in business, is not only intellectual\nastigmatism, it is poor commercial policy. To make use of present\nopportunities to control present advantages needs a great education and\na large human experience. It is the man of insight, of sympathy, of\neconomic ideals, who will lastingly control our national prosperity and\nadvance our industrial wealth.\n\nWith all this demand, the business man still stands largely in a class\nby himself, a class apart from the great leaders of the world. He is not\nyet received into the spiritual circles of the race. He goes about the\nworld, sits on boards and committees, fills directorships and\ntrusteeships, pays pew-rent, and runs towns. But when the spiritual\nconclaves of the world take place, when the things of life and death are\ninquired into, when words are said of the higher conduct of the life of\nman, if he draw near inquiringly or unguardedly to the sacred place,\nscholar and poet, priest, saint, and proud hand-worker alike rise up and\nsay, Go away.\n\nIt wears upon the heart--this spiritual isolation of the business man.\nDoes not he often say sadly to himself, They only want my money?\n\nWhy must he go away? What has he done, that he must be waved down? If we\ndiscover why he must go away, we shall discover the meaning of that\ngreat caste-line which has long been drawn, and ought no longer to be\ndrawn, between trade and letters, trade and the Church, trade and\nsocial prestige.\n\nThe reason he must go away is this: He has never ruled the higher\nhistory of man; he does not yet quite belong to the ideal-makers of the\nrace. Understand, I am not now speaking of the new business man, the\nexceptional one, upright, cultured, altruistic, whom you and I may know;\nI am speaking of a broad class-line, a class distinction.\n\nIt is a strange concept that would bar the business man from the ideal;\nthat would limit his life to an account-book, a ledger, a roll of\nstocks, rents, and possessions, instead of granting him the freedom of\nthe universe, the privilege of ministering to the race. Singularly\nenough, the business class is the last class that Christianity has set\nfree. Slaves have been given liberty; women, social companionship and\nintellectual equality; manual labor has been lifted to dignity and\nhonor. But to break the shackles of the man of trade is the work of our\nera, or of an era yet to come. Thousands of young men are daily stepping\ninto counting-houses, or behind sales-counters, or into independent\nstores, who will never lift their eyes from their goods and\naccount-books, nor rise above the linen, hardware, groceries, or\nhouse-fixtures which they sell. Such a situation is suicidal of national\nprosperity, and blocks the high hopes of the world.\n\nLack of appreciation of the life of business is sinful and unjust. A\nhigh-principled businessman may be one of the noblest leaders of\nmankind. The world needs great business men--men who will know how to\nuse the resources of a country, how to plan for its industry,\nmanufactures, and commerce: men who understand the principles of\nproduction and exchange; ways of transportation; systems of credit and\nbanking: men who know the constitution of the country, and the history\nof its development; its strength and weakness, its possibilities and\nneeds: men who will deal honorably in business contracts, both with\nbuyers and employees, and also with law-making bodies: men who will\nsteadily try to advance international prosperity, as well as\npersonal wealth.\n\nBut to understand business on this plane, and to conduct it in this\nlarge way, needs a fine education, an education built, first of all, on\na practical basis, such as the education of our common schools. Then\nshould follow a course in the ideals of the race, the classic studies in\nlanguage, literature, history, science, and philosophy. Then should come\na technical course, graduate or undergraduate, such as the courses\noffered by the Universities of Pennsylvania, Chicago, Wisconsin, which\ninclude, in general, lectures and special studies in Public Law and\nPolitics, Business Law and Practice, Political Economy, Statistics,\nBanking, Finance, and Sociology. In addition to this, there should be a\nthorough knowledge of the Bible and of Christian Ethics, with a deep\nheart-experience of religion.\n\nEndowed with natural business talent, the young man who goes out into\nthe world with such preparation as this knows a great deal more than\njust how to make money; he knows how to make it honorably and how to\nspend it, in his business, family, and social life, for the public good;\nhe has in him the making of a statesman and a philanthropist, as well as\na man of wealth.\n\nTwo things take one into the inner circle of the ideal-makers of the\nrace--imagination and sympathy. Ideals cannot be bought with gold. The\nideal is always founded on integrity, progress, and common-sense. It is\npreeminently practical, as well: the thing that inevitably must be, now\nor hereafter, however men laugh it to scorn to-day.\n\nImagination is the faculty of perceiving the higher and final relations\nof life, the relation of one's work to the progress of the world, and of\none's conduct: to spiritual history. What the ideal-maker tries to do is\nto set holy standards that shall not pass away: to do abiding work, in\nthought, deed, word; work philosophically planned, and perseveringly\ncarried out; work which he shall do regardless of the outer\ncircumstances of his life--poverty or wealth, of threats,\nmisunderstanding, or hoots of scorn. He is unmoved, both by the rage of\nthe populace and by its most tumultuous applause. He lives for truth,\nnot for personal advance; for progress, not for wealth or honor. What\nhe lays down as a precept, that he tries to live up to, in the way that\nshall win the approval of the eternal years.\n\nSordidness in commercial life is not necessary: greed is\nnot foreordained. Christianity establishes a new system of\ntrading-philosophy, and a new basis of commercial ethics. There is a\ngod-like way of trade--Christ might Himself have bought and sold--else\nChristianity fails of its full mission, and there remains a class of the\nsocially lost, of the ethically unsaved. One reason why it is so hard to\nget business men into the Church, or to interest them religiously in any\nway, is that ministers, in general, do not understand or appreciate\nbusiness men. In one of the most stirring sermons I ever heard, occurred\nthis unjust sentence: \"Our country has been built up by the martyr, and\nnot by the millionaire.\" No! Our country has been built up by _both_ the\nmartyr and the millionaire!\n\nChristianity projects into the world new ideals of Trade, of Gain, of\nCompetition, Value, and Return for Toil.\n\nWhat is Trade? Is it merely a way of making money? Then there is no\nethical basis for it. \"The amount of money which is needed for a good\nlife,\" says Aristotle, \"is not unlimited.\"\n\nOne concept is: Trade is something which belongs to me. It is that part\nof the world's exchange which I can get under my personal control. It\nis the balance between human industries and human needs which I hold\nfor my part of the world, and which others are continually trying to\nwrest from me, and which I must keep by all means, fair or foul.\nCompetition is the battle of the strongest, the quickest, the meanest! I\nmust know tricks. I must get in with people, get hold of some sort of\npull, learn to dissemble, to flatter, manipulate, hedge, dodge. Success\nis a matter of being sly. Anything is allowable which comes out ahead,\nwhich adds to the dollar-pile, or which makes the loudest\nadvertising noise!\n\nTo buy at the least, and sell at the most, regardless of the conditions\nunder which least and most are attained--the man who enters life with\nthis idea of trade in his mind might just as well be born a shark and\nlive to prey. Every free dollar in the world will tease and fret him,\nuntil he sees it on its way to his own pocket. If this is all there is\nin trade, the noble-minded will let it alone: it gives no human outlook.\nIt not only undermines personal character, it is the root of national\nignominy and dishonor.\n\nWhat has Christianity to do with this shark-instinct? with the rapacity\nwhich looks on the world as a vast grabbing-ground, and upon all natural\nresources as mere commercial prey? The value of Christianity lies in its\nreasonable and intellectual appeal. It does not spring upon one like a\nhighwayman and say, Hands up! Give me your purse! It says gently, Son,\ngive me thy heart. It then proceeds to refashion that heart, to fill it\nwith new principles and with world-dreams.\n\nTrade is a just exchange of what one man has for what another man needs.\nIt may take place individually between man and man, in which transaction\na horse, an ox, or a tool may change hands. Or one man may assume a\nresponsibility for a number of people, and say: I will give this whole\ntown shoes, in return for which you may give me a house, market-produce,\nclothing, and an education for my children. The thing will come out\neven, if you and I are honest. Or a climate, a civilization, may give to\nanother that which the other lacks. We send school-books and machinery\nto China; she sends us tea, matting, and bamboo. The whole right theory\nof trade is a give-and-take between men and nations, based on a just\nprice, and with a deep law of Value, not yet wholly formulated,\nunderlying each transaction.\n\nBargains should not be one-sided. Trade, in a large sense, is a way of\nexchange in which each party to the trade receives an advantage. Not\nonly this, it is a process of distribution, by which each one receives\nthe greatest possible advantage. Money-making is a secondary result: in\ntrue trade it is not the final benefit.\n\nTake the case of a specially helpful and paying book. The author\nreceives a royalty, and has an income. The publisher receives his\nprofits, and makes a living. The public gains inspiration and ideals.\nWho is loser? This is sheer business, yet it means loving service for\nall concerned.\n\nTo illustrate further: A physician has a frail child, with which the\nordinary milk in the market does not agree. To build up its health, he\nbuys a country place and a good cow. The child thrives. In his practice,\nhe sees many other frail children, and it occurs to him that they, too,\ncan be benefited by the same kind of care and watchfulness that he is\ngiving his own child. He buys more cows, has them scientifically cared\nfor, and his agents sell the milk. He finds himself, in the course of\ntime, the owner of a dairy farm, and a man of increasing income. But his\ntrade is not trade for the sake of money! it is trade to make sick\nchildren strong and well. He exchanges professional knowledge, executive\nability, and human sympathy, for money; in return for which, children\nreceive health, parents joy, and the race a more athletic set of men and\nwomen. This is an instance of the inner spirit of the true trade: the\nspirit which may rule all trade, deny it, or discount it, or scorn it,\nas you will.\n\nPrice is a value set on material, on labor, on interest, on scarcity, on\nexcellence, on commercial risks; it is the approximate measure of the\ncost of production. The ethical price of a commodity is the price which\nwould enable its producer to produce it under healthful and happy\nconditions--which would insure his having what Dr. Patten calls his\n\"economic rights.\"\n\nThis joyous exertion is not harmful; it is tonic. Excellence is an\ninspiration, an intoxication. Let excellence, not Will-it-pass? be the\nstandard of exchange. From the very endeavor after excellence comes a\ncertain exaltation of spirit, which ennobles the least fragment of daily\ntoil. When the producer brings forth somewhat for sale, let him say:\nThere! That is the best that I can do! It is not what I tried to make of\nit--the thing of my dreams--but it is the very best which, under the\ngiven conditions, I could produce. Then the shoddy side of trade will\ndisappear.\n\nThe Law of Equity is the final law of trade. But in whose hands is\nequity? Who appraises value? Who sets price? In whose hand is the final\nprice of the necessaries of life--wheat, rice, sugar, soap, cotton,\nwool, coal, milk, iron, lumber, ice? The man who puts a price on an\narticle, as buyer or seller, enters an arena which is not only\ncommercial--it is judicial and ethical: he declares for what amount a\nman's life-blood shall be used.\n\nNo one absolutely sets price. It is determined by far-reaching\nindustrial conditions, and by economic law. War, weather, famine,\nstocks, strikes, elections, all have a say. Yet, to a certain degree,\nthere are those who rule price. As a representative of the ideal, as\nexecutors of social trust, how shall each one use his Power of Price?\nThe man who has control of a price--a price for a day's labor, for\nwages, for a cargo, or for any kind of product--has control of the\nliving conditions of the one who works for him. The question is not: How\nshall I grind down price to the lowest? It is: What price will be an\nethical return to this man for his social toil?--just to me for my\nbrains, my capital, my energy, my distributing power,--just to him for\nhis brains, his time, his skill, his artistic perceptions, his fidelity\nand honor? Each buyer must henceforth not only resolve: I will buy only\nwhat I can pay for, but, what I can pay for at a just rate. So far as\nlies in my power, I will make an adequate return to society for this\npersonal benefit.\n\nSome one says: Do you realize that you are making a moral laughing-stock\nof much of our system of trade? that you are setting an axe to that\nsystem, more cutting than the axe of any Socialist, Nihilist, or\nAnarchist in the world? Oh, no. I have simply set myself to answer the\nquestion: How can the business man stand among the ideal-makers of the\nworld, so that he shall no more, in spiritual assemblies, be told to\ngo away?\n\nWoman is the real economic distributer. The millionaire manufacturer\nimagines that he himself runs his business. Oh, no. It is run by\nfarmers' wives. When they do not care for yarn or calico, his looms\nstand idle for a year; the vast machinery of the world turns on woman's\nlittle word: _I want_. Hence the education of women should include this\nfactor: the desire to want the right things. Extravagance is not a part\nof woman's make-up; it is extraneous.\n\n_Gain is that which permanently enriches the life._ By every act of\ncharity, or justice, or insight, or right barter, the soul is made more\ngrand. True trade everywhere may be made a new method of inspiration,\ngrowth, and power.\n\nMoney is a makeshift of the race. God is the only real appraiser, and we\nnever get back a money-value for our soul's toil. Whether we pass\nwampum, or nickels, or taels, or bank-checks, we are not yet paid for\nour trade.\n\nThe higher value of money is its spiritual capacity. Not what it will\nbring me is primarily important, but what I can buy with it for the\nrace. Sometimes the question comes over me: What am I trading for money?\nMy time? My energy? My ideals? Part of my soul is passing from me: do\ndollars ever repay? Hence it comes about that all money transactions are\nfragmentary and symbolic.\n\nMoney may lead to poverty, or to spiritual wealth. The gift of trade is\na gift of God, as much as the gift of prophecy or song. In a right way,\nwe should all love gain. We are not born to go out of the world as poor\nas when we came into it. We should gain stature, wisdom, strength,\ninfluence, ideals. If our latent business capacity were more fully\naroused, we should get much more out of life. We would refuse to barter\na spiritual heritage for carnal things.\n\nWe trade thoughts and feelings. But it is very hard to trade fine\nimpulses with those who are intrinsically vulgar. Their treasury is\nempty of spiritual coin, and their storehouse contains no\nworld-thoughts. We can send a caravan across the desert, a ship across\nthe sea, but we cannot send a Thought into a flaccid or a pompous brain.\n\nWe trade position and influence. The evil of the spoils system is not\nthat one gets something for something,--it is that one gets something\nfor something less, or for nothing. Whatever we have to give may be\nrightly given; the wrong comes when we give it to the idle or unworthy.\nWhen we trade political preferment for high merit, both the\noffice-holders and the country are gainers by the exchange.\n\nMarriage is the great mart of exchange. Here the possessions of one sex\nare set up against those of the other. Everywhere marriage is spoken of\nas a good or a bad \"bargain.\" Each man shall say: \"Sweetheart, in Myself\nI offer you the treasures of manhood. I give strength, courage,\nmagnanimity, action, protection, and the indomitable will.\" Each wife\nshould say: \"Dear, in me are all gentleness, courtesy, beauty, grace,\npatience, mercy, and hope. I, too, am brave, but my courage is of the\nheart. I, too, am strong-willed, but my will is deep-set in love.\" As\nyears go on, there comes a time when Love says: \"Between us now there is\nneither mine nor thine. The universe is ours together!\"\n\nHuman love is not all. There is yet a higher impulse. The most\nbusiness-like question that ever touches the heart of man is this: For\nwhat shall I trade my soul? We hold our souls high: we perceive that\neternity itself is not too much to ask. And hence the highest barter is\nthat of the earthly for the spiritual; of the temporal for the unseen\nand eternal. We say, Give me God, give me heaven, give me divine and\nsacrificial Love, and I will give my heart. And thus the last\ntransaction is between God and the soul. Godliness is great Gain, and to\nexchange earth for heaven is a satisfying and unregretted Trade.\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE WORLD-MARCH: OF WORKERS\n\n     [ARMAGEDON]\n\n     Jesus, Thou hast bought us\n       Not with gold or gem,\n     But with Thine own life-blood,\n       For Thy diadem.\n     With Thy blessing filling\n       Each who comes to Thee,\n     Thou hast made us willing,\n       Thou hast made us free.\n          By Thy grand redemption,\n            By Thy grace divine,\n         We are on the Lord's side;\n            Saviour, we are Thine!\n\n     Not for weight of glory,\n       Not for crown or palm,\n     Enter we the army,\n       Raise the warrior psalm;\n     But for love that claimeth\n       Lives for whom He died,\n     He whom Jesus nameth\n       Must be on His side.\n         By Thy love constraining,\n           By Thy grace divine,\n         We are on the Lord's side;\n           Saviour, we are Thine!\n\n     FRANCES RIDLEY HAVERGAL\n\nWhat is work? Work is energy applied to the creation of either material\nor immaterial products. The digging of the soil preparatory to raising a\ncorn-crop is work; the making of brooms; the writing of fugues. There is\nno one who does not work, at one time or another, and a man's social\nvalue depends largely upon the amount of work that he can do.\n\nEven the energy which is seemingly applied to destructive tasks is\nreally subsidiary to a constructive ideal. Thus the hewing of timber is\na destructive task, but its object is not to scatter trees around, but\nto make a clearing on which to plant wheat; or to have lumber, in order\nto build a house. So, also, we blast rock, in order to get stones for a\nstone wall, or for the filling of a road-bed. And we rip up old clothes\nin order to have rags, and to make room in our homes for other things.\nDestructiveness from a sheer love of destructiveness is not work--it is\nvandalism. The true Man works. When Adam's crook-stick turned over the\nbrown earth to make it fertile, he began the industry of the world. The\nwhole horizon of man's endeavor is spanned by one word, Work. It has\nbuilt cities, bridged rivers, united continents, and sent the myriad\nspindles of trade whirring under a thousand changing skies.\n\nWork is the open-sesame of success. It is curious to see how uneasily\nsome men will roam from one end of the earth to the other, trying to\nfind an easy place, a place where work will not be needed or required.\nThere is no such place. The higher the honor, the harder the work. The\npower to work is ordinarily the measure of a man's possibilities of\nsuccess. Long hours, hard toil, lack of recognition and appreciation,\ndrudgery, a thousand attempts to one successful issue,--these are the\nways in which the colossal achievements of mankind have been built up.\nWork, as has well been said, is an ascending stairway. On its broad base\nare ranged all the multitudes of the earth. Those who can climb mount\nthe higher and ever-narrowing stair.\n\nThe great man can begin anywhere, or with any task. He says, If I am\ngoing into the giant-business, I may as well begin now! Born and bred in\nthe forest, he lays hand to his axe, and looking up at some tall oak,\ncries out, I will begin here! With the first stroke of the axe, success\nis not less sure than in his last endeavor. Success of the right kind is\na scientific achievement.\n\nThe line has not yet been drawn, and I doubt whether it ever can be\ndrawn, between productive and non-productive labor. There is a cleavage\nof tasks, however, which may be approximately expressed, as work that is\ndone for support, for daily bread, and work which is done because\ncertain faculties of mind and heart and soul demand expression,\ndevelopment, and scope. We all have powers which are willing to be set\nin action primarily for self-preservation--for personal, material, and\ntransitory ends. We are also endowed with faculties which react,\nprimarily, in behalf of universal aims, though that may not debar them\nfrom also bringing an advantage to ourselves. In proportion as we are\ntalented, magnanimous, and high-minded, we delight in spending a part of\nour lives in working for the race.\n\nThus Thoreau, when he, \"by surveying, carpentry and day-labor of various\nother kinds,\" had earned $13.34, was doing income-work, the work by\nwhich he had to live. For the same purpose, he worked at raising\npotatoes, green corn, and peas. When he wrote _Walden_, he did a kind of\nwork which also in time brought him an income. But he did not write\n_Walden_ for food or money; he wrote it primarily because he liked to\nwrite, and for the benefit of mankind.\n\nIn order to be contented and happy, each normal adult human being must\nhave at least the chance of doing these two kinds of work. Unless he or\nshe can do income-work, he or she is not economically independent;\nunless he can do universal work, he is not socially and\nspiritually free.\n\nMuch of the present-day discontent is owing to the fact that these two\nkinds of work are not represented, as they should be, in every\nworking-life.\n\nThe problem in regard to the working-man is not how to pet him, nor to\npatronize him, but how to educate him and inspire him! He is not a\nparasite to be fed by the capitalist, nor is the capitalist a parasite\nupon the working-power of the working-man. Both are men. The problem is,\nHow shall the capitalist lead the noblest, most public-spirited, and\nhelpful life in relation to those in his employ? How shall the\nworking-man lay hold on the best that life can give? How shall he find a\nwork which he is competent to do, and likes to do, and may be supported\nby doing--and at the same time have a chance to grow; to enter into the\nlarge, free culture-life of the world?\n\nThe complaint of the working-man, when really analyzed, runs down to\nthis: I do income-work, but it does not bring me bread enough to live.\nNot only that, but ground down as I am by toil, all possibility of the\nlarger, universal work is shut away from me. My faculties are\natrophied--paralyzed--and hence my soul smoulders with deep and angry\ndiscontent. This ceaseless and sordid anxiety for bread cuts me out of\nmy world-life, my world-toil. I cannot do scientific research-work, or\nwrite the books and papers that I ought. My universal labor is\ninterrupted: I cannot be happy until I can take up this larger\nwork again.\n\nAs the trade of civilization advances, the meaning of bread changes. The\nuniversity professor, no less than the day-laborer, finds his income\ntoo small for him, and says, \"I, too, do income-work which does not\nbring me bread, books, travel, society, a summer home, and surroundings\nwhich are not only decent and sanitary, but refined and beautiful.\"\n\nIs it not also the source of the discontent to-day, among almost all\nclasses of women, except the most highly educated and efficient? Women\nsay--our modern daughters, wives, and mothers: \"In the home, we do\nincome-work for which we do not receive income. When strangers do this\nwork, they are paid, and we are not.\" In addition, many a woman is so\nbound down by daily tasks, that her whole soul cries out, and we hear of\nthe high rate of insanity among farmers' wives, of nervous prostration\nof the housewives in our towns, and become accustomed to such\nexpressions as \"the death of a woman on a Kansas farm.\"\n\nThis discontent takes many restless forms. It leads daughters, who ought\nto be at home, out into morally dangerous but income-earning work; it\ntakes wives out into all manner of clubs, without regard to the fact: as\nto whether the particular club, in its atmosphere and influence, is good\nor bad; it brings discouragement, disorder, and unrest into the home,\ndissatisfaction with house-duties and home-tasks, and is sapping our\nlife where it should be best and strongest--in the home--taking out of\nit youth, spirit, enthusiasm, inspiration, and content.\n\nThe three questions asked in regard to each worker are: 1. What work\ncan he do? 2. Of what quality? 3. In what time? The difference between\nindustry and idleness is that work is one thing which no one may\nhonorably escape. Since it must be done, the problem of life is not how\nto escape work, but how to find the right work, and how best to do it,\nand most swiftly, when the choice is made.\n\n\"_Forth they come from grief and torment; on they wend\n   toward health and mirth,\nAll the wide world is their dwelling, every corner of the\n   earth.\nBuy them, sell them for thy service! Try the bargain what\n   'tis worth,\n          For the days are marching on.\n\n\"These are they who build thy houses, weave thy raiment,\n   win thy wheat,\nSmooth the rugged, fill the barren, turn the bitter into\n   sweet,\nAll for thee this day--and ever. What reward for them\n   is meet?\n          Till the host comes marching on._\"\n\n             WILLIAM MORRIS\n\nSECOND\n\nThe trade of toil for money has led to many problems and discussions.\nTo-day the trenchant question: \"What More than Wages?\" is a matter of\neager talk. Is this a living-wage?--Just enough warmth, not to freeze.\nJust enough clothing to be decent. Just enough food to go through the\nday without actual hunger. Just enough shelter to keep out the wind and\nrain and snow. Just enough education to learn to read and write\nand count.\n\nNo. As the theory of bodily freedom demands for each man life, liberty,\nand the pursuit of happiness, so the highest theory of to-day lays down\ndemands of economic freedom beyond the mere fad of possible existence.\nDr. Patten has formulated certain \"economic rights\" of man. Each\nemployer must say: Before I settle back with a serene belief that I have\ngiven my men a living-wage, let me ask: Have they sun? air? sanitary\nsurroundings and conditions? medical care? leisure? education? a chance\nto grow? Have they enough money for ordinary occasions, and a little to\ngive away? No man or woman has a living-wage, who has no money to\ngive away.\n\nEducation and comfort add to the value of the employed. The cook who has\na rocking-chair, a cook-book, and a housekeeping magazine in her kitchen\nwill do more work, and better work, other things being equal, than the\ncook who has none. The workman who lives in a clean, sunny, well-aired\nplace, where he can found a home, and bring up healthy children, will do\nmore work, and better work, than the workman who lives in a damp, dark,\nill-ventilated tenement, and who goes to his day's work with a heart\nsullen and broken because of avoidable illness and sorrow in his poor\nlittle home. Five thousand employees who have a night-school,\nluncheon-rooms, little houses and gardens, a savings-bank, and a library\nof books and pictures are worth more than those who are given no such\nadvantages of happiness, growth, and content. The Railroad Young Men's\nChristian Associations are said to be a good economic investment, as\nwell as an uplifting moral influence.\n\nThis appears to be a fundamental economic law: _Every physical, mental,\nor spiritual advantage offered to an honest working man or woman\nincreases his economic efficiency_. Therefore even the selfish policy of\nshrewd corporations to-day is to screw up, and not down; while the more\nphilanthropic are beginning to see, in their social power, a luminous\nopportunity to do a god-like service.\n\nBut the capitalist, however just or generous, cannot do for a man what\nhe cannot or will not do for himself. Too many workers imagine that a\nliving-wage is to be given to each man, no matter how he behaves or\nworks. This is a false assumption. Underlying all human effort, there\nruns a final law, that of Compensation: _What I earn, I shall some day\nhave_. This is a very different proposition from this: _What I do not\nearn, I want to have_! For every stroke of human toil, the universe\nassigns a right reward--a reward, not of money only, but of peace of\nheart, joy, and the possibilities of helpfulness. But when the work done\nhas not been done faithfully, or well, or honestly, or in the right\nspirit, the reward is lessened to that exact degree. To the end of time,\nthe idle and the lazy must, if they are dependent on their own\nexertions, be ill housed and fed. If a man wastes, or his wife does, he\nmust not complain that his income will not support him. If he lets\nopportunities of sustenance and advancement go by, the capitalist is not\nto be held to account.\n\nThere are two chief kinds of economic difficulties. One is the problem\nof the capitalist: How much ought I to pay? The second is that of the\nworking-man: How much service must I render? How much ought I to be\npaid? Of the second kind, nearly every phase of it begins right here,\nthat men and women demand for labor something which they have not\nearned. They do careless, indifferent, shiftless, reckless work, and\nthen demand a living-wage. The capitalist is not inclined to raise his\nscale of prices, knowing that he has built up his business by prudence,\nsagacity, and tireless application--the very qualities which his\ndissatisfied employees lack.\n\nWe need not pay--we ought not to pay--for incompetence, for\nimpertinence, for disobedience of orders, for laziness, for shirking,\nfor cheating, or for theft. To do so is a social wrong. It is the wrong\nthat lies back, not only of sinecures and spoils, but of employing\nincompetent and wasteful cooks and dressmakers.\n\nWhat we make of our lives through wages depends upon ourselves. For\ninstance, a man gives each of five boys twenty-five cents for sweeping\nsnow off his sidewalks. One boy tosses pennies, and loses his quarter by\ngambling. One boy buys cigarettes, and sends his money up in smoke. One\nboy buys newspapers, and sells them at a profit which buys him his\ndinner. A fourth boy buys seeds, plants them, and raises a tiny garden\nwhich keeps him in beans for a whole season, The fifth boy buys a book\nwhich starts him on the career of an educated man: he becomes an\ninventor and a man of means. The man who paid out the twenty-five cents\nto each boy is in no way responsible for the success or failure of their\ninvestment of this quarter. He is responsible only for the fact that he\ndid or did not pay a fair price for the work.\n\nGod, the great Paymaster, gives to each of us the one talent, the two\ntalents, or the ten talents, of endowment and opportunity: after that,\nwe are left to our own devices!\n\nThere are four things which every employee should constantly bear in\nmind, if he wishes to advance,--skill, business opportunity, loyalty,\nand control. Until a man has mastered what he has to do, he cannot be\nexpected to be accounted a serious factor in the economic world. The\nmoment he achieves skill in what he has to do--and this is a question of\nthoroughness, accuracy, and speed--he has achieved power, a possibility\nof dictation in the matter of hours and wages.\n\nThe next point is business opportunity. Two men, of exactly the same\nopportunities and endowments, take up the same task. One man idles and\nis surpassed by the other, or he does only what he is told to do,\nwithout further thought. The other performs his set task, but at the\nsame time he is examining into the principles of his engine, or into the\nconduct of the factory or business. In a few years he is the foreman, or\nan inventor, or a partner, with independent capital of his own. Again,\nthere is a blind way of doing skilled work, or of merely doing it\nwithout noticing where it is most needed, or how the market is going for\nthis special kind of work. The one who has his eyes open reads, notes\nthe state of the market, adds to his skill the power of counsel, and can\ngradually take a larger responsibility upon him, which will advance the\neconomic value of his time, as well as the work. There is a constant\nflux in the labor-world, which is the result largely, not of special\nopportunity, but of worth, application, and concentrated thought.\n\nThird, loyalty has a high mercantile value. Disloyalty is a sin.\n\nThe fourth point is control. Does it not strike wonder to think how some\nmen have under them, either in their industrial plant, or in their\nrailway systems, or in their syndicate-work, anywhere from a few hundred\nto ten, fifteen, or twenty thousand men? How do they maintain\ndiscipline, either themselves, or through their subordinates? This\nproblem of control is a serious one in business. Every angry threat,\nevery sullen hour, each case of insubordination, every strike, every\nwidespread dissatisfaction, means economic waste. It means expense both\nof time and money to send for Pinkertons to keep order and preserve\ndiscipline. The man who adds to his technical skill, and his knowledge\nof the market, the power of control adds great force and value to his\nwork. Higher yet is executive force, the power to adjust\nresponsibilities and duties in such a way as to get back a high economic\nreturn in the way of service. But above all, there is that force of\ncharacter which impresses itself on a company, on a decade, on a\ngeneration--so that some names are handed down in business from\ngeneration to generation, all men knowing that from father to son, and\nagain to his son, there will pass down that certain integrity, nobility,\nsteadfastness of purpose, fidelity, and honor which give credit\nthroughout the business world, and which promise health and happiness\nfor those who are happy to be in their employ.\n\nBefore a man complains of his wages, then, let him ask himself: Have I\nmastered my work? Am I loyal? Am I capable of larger responsibilities,\nand of wider control?\n\n\n\n\nTHIRD\n\nWILLIAM MORRIS says: \"_It is right and necessary that all men should\nhave work to do which shall be worth doing, and be of itself pleasant to\ndo: and which should be done under such conditions as would make it\nneither over-wearisome, nor over-anxious._\"\n\nThis theorem cannot be upheld in its entirety, though there is a deep\ntruth beneath it. There are many things, such as the collecting of\ngarbage, the washing of the dead poor, the cleaning of cesspools, the\nbutchery of cattle for the market, and the execution of capital\ncriminals, which can scarcely be called pleasant to do, and must yet be\ndone. As long as the world is the world, and there is in it sin, decay,\ndisease, and death, we cannot hope to make the work or the conditions of\nwork absolutely ideal: we _can_ make ideal the spirit in which work\nis done!\n\nA fine story is told that long ago, when the cholera once broke out in\nPhiladelphia, the hospitals fell into a fearful state. One day, a plain,\nquiet little man stepped into the chief hospital, looked about a moment,\nand set to work. No task was too dirty or disagreeable for him; no\ndetail was too disgusting. He did anything he saw to be done,--called in\nadditional doctors, organized the nurses, and himself waited on patients\nnight and day. He soon had the hospital in good shape again. When the\ncrisis passed, and every one began to demand, Who is this man?--they\nwere told: It is Stephen Girard. The work was not pleasant, but the\nspirit was kind, and the heart delighted in its self-appointed toil.\n\nWork in general, however, that has worth has several elements. First, It\nmust be individual. It must be joyfully done: there must enter into work\nthe vitality of a happy spirit. It must be spontaneous. This is why\nmachine-work can never be thoroughly beautiful: it lacks the spontaneity\nof life. The hand never makes two things alike. With the mood, the\nweather, the occasion, there are little touches added which a machine\ncannot give. Life always varies and thinks of new effects.\n\nWhen we try to realize what work is, when it is merely an amount of toil\nprodded out of man or woman by a hard taskmaster, we have only to look\nback to the bondage of Israel in Egypt, or to the time of Scylla, when\nthere were thirteen million slaves in Italy alone: slaves whose set\ntasks were of over two hundred and fifty kinds; who worked on the\nroad-building, on public works, and in rowing in the galleys of the\nslave-propelled ships. In Carthage agriculture was for a time largely\ncarried on by slave-labor. How different is this slave-labor from the\ncraft-work of mediaeval times, when, under the protection of the guilds,\nmanual labor became exalted to an artistic rank, and the workers at the\nloom, the metal-workers, the wood-carvers, the tapestry-weavers, and the\nworkers in pottery and glass produced objects whose beauty has never\nbeen either equalled or surpassed. Andrea del Sarto and Benvenuto\nCellini were workers, and their work remains.\n\nAgain, good work is born of affection. Love teaches more art than all\nthe schools. What we love, we instinctively beautify. The artist\nbeautifies the material on which he works. He loves his task, and from\nhis love there begins a gradual shaping of the ideal. The product gains\na touch of beauty. The needlework of Egypt and Byzantium, the laces of\nVenice and of Spain, are historic. It is said of Queen Isabella, that\nshe was one of the best needleworkers of her age; that \"her _motifs_\nwere the great events of the time.\"\n\nA peasant girl of Venice was once given a beautiful coral-branch and\nsome rare leaves and shells which her lover had gathered for her from\nthe sea-depths. She was untaught in art, and making fish-nets was her\nwonted work. Day by day as she wrought her nets, she looked upon the\nlovely sea-treasures, their beauty passed into her heart and mind, and\nshe began to copy, spray by spray, the coral-foliage, the leaves of the\nsea-grasses, and the curves of the sea-shells, until after a time, in\nthe meshes of her fish-nets, she had imprisoned forms of exquisite\nbeauty, and one saw there reproduced, in dainty and artistic grouping,\nwhat her very soul had loved and fed upon. Her fish-nets became works\nof art.\n\nWork of a high order is always based on high ideals and on great\nthoughts. It implies a vast amount of toil. The Capellmeister of the\nVatican choir to-day is that wonderful young genius, Perosi, who is\nstirring all Europe by the beauty of his musical work, and by the\nspirituality and fervor of his musical imagination. He has set himself\nto compose twelve oratorios, which shall body forth the whole life of\nthe Saviour. He believes that the music-lover and the church-lover may\nbe identical, and has set his hand to the uniting of all true\nmusic-lovers with the great offices and services and influences of the\nChurch. Here is Work exalted to its spiritual office: to carry out, not\nonly ideals of beauty and harmony, but to advance spiritual progress.\nThis is the final aim of all true work: it must be not only aesthetic,\nand honest, but spiritual. The prayer of the true workman is ever to\nmake himself a workman approved unto God. \"May the beauty of the Lord be\nupon us, and the work of our hands, establish Thou it!\"\n\nThe worker should have change of work. Nature never intended that a man\nshould do one thing all his life. This is in harmony neither with man's\ninfinite capacity, nor with her inexhaustible variety. Change is\ncultural, and a man's work Should, from time to time, engross every\nworking-power he has.\n\nWorking-surroundings should not only be sanitary, they should be\nbeautiful. What influences one most at college, and makes most for one's\nhappiness, is not the fact of the work in recitation-rooms, out of\nbooks, laboratories, and under teachers. The glory of college life is,\nthat wherever one goes, the eyes look out on beauty, and wherever one\nworks, there are those whom we love who work beside us.\n\nAs one passes down the long college corridors, the eyes fall upon palm\nand statue, upon frieze and fresco, and the carbon copies of immortal\npaintings. Everywhere there are the inspirations of sculpture and\narchitecture, of music, literature, and art. Beauty is in and about the\nplace in which one thinks and works. This is the undying charm of\nOxford--the gathering traditions of centuries, the gleaming spires, the\nage-worn walls and buttresses, the clinging vine, the tremulous light\nand shadow on the ancient halls, the sculpture of porch and clerestory,\nand the light that falls through richly tinted windows.\n\nThis beauty should not be monopolized by any one class. About the places\nwhere we work, we should have, as far as possible, something of the\nbeauty of the world. We should have wide, shaded streets and parks, even\nin great cities; towers and pinnacles; sky-lines of vigor, grace, and\nmassive strength. Cannot department stores be artistically fashioned and\nbuilt? Cannot market-houses have arches and arabesques? May not even the\nBourse have something about it suggestive of great art? Cannot our\nstreets have curves and storied cross-ways? Cannot porters and draymen\nhave somewhat to arouse and satisfy aesthetic instincts? Cannot our\nday-laborers be granted vision?\n\nWhy should we have the Gothic cathedral, with its exquisite traceries\nand carvings, pillars and reredos and screen, for men to pray in, one or\ntwo hours a week, and the hideous, grime-covered, foul-smelling,\noverheated factories, in which men and women spend their working-lives?\nThis is what Christianity must do: it must implant joy and beauty, as\nwell as honesty and fidelity, in the way, place, and thought of work!\nWhen religion, education, art, and brotherly affection have joined hands\nin a charmed circle, we shall have new ideas of working-places, as well\nas of praying-places, and of living-places! It is not enough that a\nfactory should be situated, as the best factories now are, in the open\ncountry, with sunshine and fresh air. The blockhouse parallelograms and\nsquares should be replaced by something that has intrinsic beauty and\nthe haunting completeness of memory and association, so that the place\nwhere a man works shall no more be to him a nightmare, but the\natmosphere and inspiration of his dreams!\n\nAnd those we love shall work beside us! Here is another thought: Shall\nall association in work be arbitrary? Is there not a more human way than\nthe chain-gang way? Could not friends work more together, so that one's\ndaily work should be, not a time of separation from all we love most,\nbut a time of intellectual sympathy and helpfulness, of companionship\nand true-hearted loyalty? This, and many other good things, it is not\ntoo much to hope for. Truly, as Morris writes, \"_The Day is Coming_.\"\n\n\"_Then a man shall work and bethink him, and rejoice in\n   the deeds of his handy\nNor yet come home in the even too faint and weary to\n   stand._\n\n\"_Men in that time a-coming shall work and have no fear\n   For the morrow's lack of earning and the hunger-wolf\n     anear._\n\n\"_And what wealth then shall be left us when none shall\n   gather gold\nTo buy his friend in the market, and pinch and pine the\n   sold?_\n\n\"_Nay, what save the lovely city, and the little house on the\n   hill,\nAnd the wastes and the woodland beauty, and the happy\n   fields we till_;\n\n\"_And the homes of ancient stories, the tombs of the mighty\n   dead;\nAnd the wise men seeking out marvels, and the poet's teeming\n   head;_\n\n\"_And the painter's hand of wonder; and the marvellous\n   fiddle-bow;\nAnd the banded choirs of music:--all those that do and\n   know._\n\n\"_Far all these shall be ours and all men's, nor shall any\n   lack a share\nOf the toil and the gain of living in the days when the\n   world grows fair_.\"\n\n\n\n\nFOURTH\n\nGood workers are trained in the home, the school, the shop, the wider\nworld. Every home is an industrial establishment. In it go on the\nindustrial processes of cooking, cleaning, sewing, washing; the care of\nsilver, glass, linen, and household stores; the activities of buying\nfood and clothing; the moral responsibilities of teaching and training\nservants and children. If any healthy member of the home is excused from\nat least some form of active work, he will inevitably be a shirker when\nhe grows up. Cannot almost all the problems of human training be run\ndown to this: How to teach a child to work? If he can work, he can be\nhappy; but if he does not want to work, he shall never be happy. No\nwork, no joy, is the universal dictum.\n\nThis is the great hardship of the children of great wealth: they are not\ntaught to work. To avoid this difficulty, in two very wealthy families\nthat I know, the boys were even obliged to darn their own stockings and\nmend their own clothes. One young hopeful once tore his clothes\na-fishing, and mended his trousers with a scarlet flannel patch! Some\nmothers do not allow their little girls to go to school until their beds\nare made up and their rooms in order. Other equally wise parents have\ntools in the house, and allow the boys to do all the repair work, the\ndaughters all the family mending, or to care for the linen; the boys to\nput in electric fixtures and bells, and keep the batteries in order.\nQueen Margherita of Italy, Queen Elizabeth of Roumania, Queen Alexandra\nof England, and the Empress Augusta of Germany are all women who have\nbeen from their childhood acquainted with simple and practical household\ntasks. This principle is a right one and underlies much after-success.\nEach child should, first of all, have a mastery of home-tasks. Then,\nwhether on the prairie or in the palace, he is free and independent.\n\nWhat makes the differences in the social privileges given to one class\nof workers above another? In reality, we are all workers. No one ought\nto live, if in health, who does not work. But for some forms of work,\nmen and women receive an income, and nothing more. For other work, men\nand women may or may not receive a large personal income, but their work\nis recognized, they are a part of the best social circles, and when they\ndie, a city or a nation grieves.\n\nThe essential difference is this: that one is honor-work, and one is\nnot. Wherever in the world work is done in a spirit of love and\nfidelity, it brings its own reward in recognition and in personal\naffection. Sooner or later, honor-work receives honor.\n\nAnother reason for exaltation of one form of work above another, is\nthat some kinds of work are so very hard to do. They involve the intense\nand complicated action of many and of complex powers. It may be hard\nphysical work to break stones for a road-way, but the task itself is a\nsimple one--the lifting of the arm and dropping it again with sufficient\nforce to split a rock apart. But the writing of a prose masterpiece,\nsuch as the _Areopagitica_, involves the highest human faculties in\nharmonious action. If we add to the requirements of prose, the rhythm,\nthe exalted imagery, and perhaps the assonance and rhyme of verse, we\nstill further increase the difficulty of the task, and the honor of its\nsuccessful achievement. The king-work of a powerful monarch, the\npresident-work of a republican leader, is serious work to do. Our honor\nis not all given to the king or president income, salary, or office; it\nis a tribute to hard and royal-minded work.\n\nHousehold service is personal service. It cannot be made a thing of set\nhours, and of measurably set tasks, as office-work maybe. We may talk of\n\"eight-hour shifts,\" but they are scarcely practicable. Not every baby\nwould go to successive \"shifts\"! House-demands vary, not only with every\nhousehold, but with every day.\n\nWhen love-making is wholly scientific, then domestic service will be.\nThere is in it the same delicate personal adjustment, the changing\nrequirements of weather, health, temper, and season, of emergency and\nstress, that are to be found in the most purely personal relation. When\nthere is a period of unusual sickness through the community, not only\nthe doctors have extra tasks, but all household servants as well.\n\nWhat social recognition can be given to servants who lie, steal, who\nshirk every duty that can be shirked, and who are both incompetent and\nunfaithful? The here-and-there one faithful helper receives her meed of\nappreciation and affection. The whole aspect of household work will\nchange when honor-work is given: when home-helpers come up to us, from\nthe truthful and honor-loving class.\n\nThe school-room is the place in which the principles of work are\nimplanted: thoroughness, grasp, speed, decision, and definite purpose.\nThe shop is the apprentice-place of work, before one takes up individual\nresponsibilities. The man who wishes to rise in the railroad service\ngoes into the shops and roundhouse. The man who wishes to take charge of\nan important department in a department store is put to tying packages.\n\nTeachers' work will not be rightly done until certain advantages are\ngiven to teachers that are now largely withheld. Teachers need more\nsociety, more hours of play, freer opportunity of marriage. Instead of\nbeing tied up to exercise-books and roll-books, in their home-hours,\nthey should have a chance to spend their time on the golf-links, at\nafternoon teas, in visiting and in entertaining friends. Take away\nsociety from any man or woman, and you take away the possibility of a\ngrowing, happy, and helpful life. We need friends just as we need air.\nTeachers need admiration and affection, just as much as the society\ngirl does.\n\nUniversities should have, in their faculties, men and women who\nrepresent the best social as well as the best intellectual life of the\nworld--who are not only, in the highest sense of the word, society men\nand women, but who are social leaders, inspiring truth, inculcating\nlarger social ideals of the best sort.\n\nThe problem between capitalist and laborer, however, only affects a\nportion of the world; that of domestic service a still smaller\nproportion; that of teachers affects only a class. There is another\nproblem, which affects nearly all married women, and therefore a large\nsection of the human race. It is the problem of mother-work. Here is\nwhere the economist should next turn his attention. First, What is\nMother-work? Second, What are the best economic conditions under which\nthis work can be done? When we have solved this question, we shall have\nsolved a great human problem.\n\nMother-work includes the bearing and the rearing of children, the\nconduct of a home, and the placing of that home in the right social\natmosphere and relations. It includes manual, intellectual, and\nspiritual labors. The one who lives and works, as God meant her to live\nand work, will never feel over-fatigue. Why do mothers often look so\ntired? It is because they too often do not have what every mother ought\nto have: education, rest, change, a Sabbath-day, individual income,\nintellectual interests, society.\n\nWhether in the simplest home or in the stateliest, there are certain\nmanual things to be done in regard to the care and bringing-up of\nchildren, and the conduct of a home. To make the conditions of a woman's\nlife easier, the very first thing is this: 1. _Women should be educated\nprimarily for home-life._ By this I do not mean that a woman should be\ntaught cooking, and not political economy; that she should be instructed\nin dressmaking and nursery-work, but not in chemistry and logic. I mean\nthat the very fullest education that schools, colleges, universities,\nand foreign travel can give, should be given to the woman who is\nfortunate enough to have them at command, and that every woman,\naccording to the degree of her possibilities of education and\nopportunity, should have the best. But always this education should be\nthought of as a part of her preparation for a woman's life. When boys\nare in a business college, the principal of that college does not forget\nthat among the boys there may be more than one who will never have a\nbusiness life, but who will go out into other interests and pursuits.\nYet he turns the thoughts of _all_ boys in his school specially toward\nbusiness problems. In schools and colleges for women, not all the girls\nwill marry, not all will be mothers, but most of them will be. Is not,\nthen, the normal education of a woman that which, while it does not\ncramp her life in one direction, nor mould her in a set way, yet keeps\nalways in mind the fact that the normal woman is being educated for a\nnormal woman's life?\n\nThis would not necessarily change the curriculum of our colleges in any\nway; it would change the spirit and atmosphere of some of them at once.\nInstead of the spirit being: \"My mind is just as good as a man's. What a\nman can study, I can learn! What a man can do, I can do!\"--the spirit\nwould be this: \"I am going out into a woman's life, and it is my\nbusiness now to take to myself all the wisdom, counsel, experience, and\ninspiration of past ages, that I may be the very grandest woman that\nhistory has yet seen! I will be a land-mark in time: I will be a pivot\nin history around which the earth shall turn. Because of my life, women\nto the end of time shall be able to live a truer, freer, better life!\"\n\nWith this thought in mind, all the academic subjects would still pass\ninto her mind and life, but they would be much more naturally set and\ntheir value would be greatly enhanced. Then we would not have the\ntoo-ambitious woman stepping out of college, or the restless and\ndiscontented one. We would have the large-minded, earnest, noble,\npublic-spirited one, who would go out into the world as a fine type of\nwoman, to live a woman's life and do a woman's work. Married or\nunmarried, she would still have a woman's interests, a woman's\ninfluence, a woman's charm.\n\nThis higher education may or may not include practical studies in\ndomestic science, nursing, and household emergencies, but she should\nlearn somewhere the elements of these studies, so that when she goes\ninto a home of her own her duties and responsibilities will not be met\nin a half-hearted and untrained way.\n\n2. Mothers should have rest-hours and rest-days. Is it not something\nextraordinary, from a purely economic point of view, that while it is\nwidely recognized that every one should have one day in seven for rest,\nthat while business men are expected to close up their offices on the\nSabbath, and all working men and women are given this day in the stores,\nthe factories, and mines--the cook and maids have their Sundays out, and\ntheir week-day afternoons--that nowhere on earth, so far as I know, has\nthere ever been a systematic arrangement by which mothers, as a class,\nhave any specially arranged hours or days for rest! A baby's care does\nnot stop on the Sabbath, and the average mother is practically on duty,\nat least over-seeing, day and night, twenty-four hours out of the\ntwenty-four, from one end of the year to the other, no matter how many\nmaids and nurses she may have in her employ!\n\n3. Personal income and its use. What we buy marks our own individuality,\nas well as what we do. The woman whose father or husband adjusts her\nexpenses and expenditures cannot by any possibility be the kind of woman\nthat the one is who chooses her own things, and spends her money\nabsolutely to suit herself. When a man buys cigars or fishing-tackle,\nhis wife may prefer to buy oratorios and golf-clubs.\n\n4. Mothers should have some interest outside of home-tasks, to keep them\nin touch with world-interests and world-tasks. Not all mother's duty is\ninside the four walls of her home. The race has demands upon her, as\nwell as her own child. She ought to be guarded from that short-sighted\nand selfish devotion which makes her look upon her child as the centre\nof the universe, and which leads her to sacrifice every hour, every\nthought, every talent, to him alone.\n\n5. Building up the place of a home in a community means much more than a\nrivalry with one's neighbors, as to which one shall have the cleanest\nhouse, the prettiest or most expensive curtains and furniture, who shall\nentertain the most, and whose children shall present the best appearance\nin the world! Making a social place for a family involves a very wide\nacquaintance with really great social ideals; with the best instincts\nand customs; with world refinement and manners, as well as those of\none's own town or village--with the social possibilities of life in\ngeneral, as well as the etiquette of Quinton's Corners! To give the\nright stamp upon her home, a mother must have a social life, as well as\ndomestic one. She must have time to enter somewhat into the activities\nof her own neighborhood, and must have society after marriage, as well\nas before.\n\nIt is a different sort of society that she then needs. It is not a\nboy-and-girl society, with its crude ways, and its adolescent ideas of\nlife. It is the society of earnest, cultured, and public-spirited men\nand women, each of whom is adding something to the general store of\ninterest and ideals; each of whom is doing some phase of social work,\naccording to his own talent and opportunity.\n\nWhen a mother steps out into life in this large way, makes education and\ntraining tributary to her mother-life, and does not stop growing\nintellectually or spiritually,--her charm as a woman increases, instead\nof diminishes, every year of her married life. Her looks mark her\neverywhere as a supremely happy woman, and she goes out into the world\nmarked with that strange, deep, grand impress of motherhood and\nwomanhood, which has always made the true woman not only a\nworking-mother, but a love-crowned queen!\n\nThese and many other thoughts flit over one's mind in looking at any\nphase of work, or any piece of work. In the right choice of work lies\nthe fullest use of one's capacities; in the right conditions of work\nlies the freest play of one's energies; in the right spirit of work lies\nthe way of one's lasting happiness, and the foretaste of eternal joys.\n\nThus the world is seen to consist of great cycles of workers, rising in\ntiers one above another. Those who do not work are quickly cut out from\nall participation in race-progress and in race-delights; those who work\nearnestly, but blindly, have their small reward. But those who work with\nspiritual energy and enthusiasm are weaving their handiwork into the\nvery fibre of the universal frame. It is for these spiritual workers\nthat the great eagerness of life is undying; for them there is no shadow\nof fatigue; for them there is the joy of mastery and accomplishment; for\nthem the peace of soul that comes from the triumphant achievement of\none's mission to mankind!\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Warriors, by Lindsay, Anna Robertson Brown\n\n*** "}, {"short_book_title": "The Mystery by Stewart Edward White and Samuel Hopkins Adams", "publication_date": 1907, "url": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10008", "text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Danny Wool, Luiz Antonio de Souza,\nElisa Williams, Tonya Allen and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\n\n\n\nTHE MYSTERY\n\nBY\n\nSTEWART EDWARD WHITE\n\nAND\n\nSAMUEL HOPKINS ADAMS\n\n_Illustrations by Will Crawford_\n\n1907\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nPART ONE\n\nTHE SEA RIDDLE\n\nI.

On the ocean's wide expanse a hulk wallowed sluggishly,\nthe forgotten relict of a once brave and sightly ship, possibly the\nSphinx of some untold ocean tragedy, she lay black and forbidding in the\nordered procession of waves. Half a mile to the east of the derelict\nhovered a ship's cutter, the turn of her crew's heads speaking\nexpectancy. As far again beyond, the United States cruiser\n_Wolverine_ outlined her severe and trim silhouette against the\nhorizon. In all the spread of wave and sky no other thing was visible.\nFor this was one of the desert parts of the Pacific, three hundred miles\nnorth of the steamship route from Yokohama to Honolulu, five hundred\nmiles from the nearest land, Gardner Island, and more than seven hundred\nnorthwest of the Hawaiian group.\n\nOn the cruiser's quarter-deck the officers lined the starboard rail.\nTheir interest was focussed on the derelict.\n\n\"Looks like a heavy job,\" said Ives, one of the junior lieutenants.\n\"These floaters that lie with deck almost awash will stand more hammering\nthan a mud fort.\"\n\n\"Wish they'd let us put some six-inch shells into her,\" said Billy\nEdwards, the ensign, a wistful expression on his big round cheerful face.\n\"I'd like to see what they would do.\"\n\n\"Nothing but waste a few hundred dollars of your Uncle Sam's money,\"\nobserved Carter, the officer of the deck. \"It takes placed charges inside\nand out for that kind of work.\"\n\n\"Barnett's the man for her then,\" said Ives. \"He's no economist when it\ncomes to getting results. There she goes!\"\n\nWithout any particular haste, as it seemed to the watchers, the hulk was\nshouldered out of the water, as by some hidden leviathan. Its outlines\nmelted into a black, outshowering mist, and from that mist leaped a\ngiant. Up, up, he towered, tossed whirling arms a hundred feet abranch,\nshivered, and dissolved into a widespread cataract. The water below was\nlashed into fury, in the midst of which a mighty death agony beat back\nthe troubled waves of the trade wind. Only then did the muffled double\nboom of the explosion reach the ears of the spectators, presently to be\nfollowed by a whispering, swift-skimming wavelet that swept irresistibly\nacross the bigger surges and lapped the ship's side, as for a message\nthat the work was done.\n\nHere and there in the sea a glint of silver, a patch of purple, or dull\nred, or a glistening apparition of black showed where the unintended\nvictims of the explosion, the gay-hued open-sea fish of the warm waters,\nhad succumbed to the force of the shock. Of the intended victim there was\nno sign save a few fragments of wood bobbing in a swirl of water.\n\nWhen Barnett, the ordnance officer in charge of the destruction, returned\nto the ship, Carter complimented him.\n\n\"Good clean job, Barnett. She was a tough customer, too.\"\n\n\"What was she?\" asked Ives.\n\n\"The _Caroline Lemp_, three-masted schooner. Anyone know about her?\"\n\nIves turned to the ship's surgeon, Trendon, a grizzled and brief-spoken\nveteran, who had at his finger's tips all the lore of all the waters\nunder the reign of the moon.\n\n\"What does the information bureau of the Seven Seas know about it?\"\n\n\"Lost three years ago--spring of 1901--got into ice field off the tip of\nthe Aleutians. Some of the crew froze. Others got ashore. Part of\nsurvivors accounted for. Others not. Say they've turned native. Don't\nknow myself.\"\n\n\"The Aleutians!\" exclaimed Billy Edwards. \"Great Cats! What a drift! How\nmany thousand miles would that be?\"\n\n\"Not as far as many another derelict has wandered in her time, son,\" said\nBarnett.\n\nThe talk washed back and forth across the hulks of classic sea mysteries,\nnew and old; of the _City of Boston_, which went down with all\nhands, leaving for record only a melancholy scrawl on a bit of board to\nmeet the wondering eyes of a fisherman on the far Cornish coast; of the\n_Great Queensland_, which set out with five hundred and sixty-nine\nsouls aboard, bound by a route unknown to a tragic end; of the\n_Naronic_, with her silent and empty lifeboats alone left, drifting\nabout the open sea, to hint at the story of her fate; of the\n_Huronian_, which, ten years later, on the same day and date, and\nhailing from the same port as the _Naronic_, went out into the void,\nleaving no trace; of Newfoundland captains who sailed, roaring with\ndrink, under the arches of cathedral bergs, only to be prisoned, buried,\nand embalmed in the one icy embrace; of craft assailed by the terrible\none-stroke lightning clouds of the Indian Ocean, found days after, stone\nblind, with their crews madly hauling at useless sheets, while the\nofficers clawed the compass and shrieked; of burnings and piracies; of\npest ships and slave ships, and ships mad for want of water; of whelming\nearthquake waves, and mysterious suctions, drawing irresistibly against\nwind and steam power upon unknown currents; of stout hulks deserted in\npanic although sound and seaworthy; and of others so swiftly dragged down\nthat there was no time for any to save himself; and of a hundred other\nstrange, stirring and pitiful ventures such as make up the inevitable\nperil and incorrigible romance of the ocean. In a pause Billy Edwards\nsaid musingly:\n\n\"Well, there was the _Laughing Lass_.\"\n\n\"How did you happen to hit on her?\" asked Barnett quickly.\n\n\"Why not, sir? It naturally came into my head. She was last seen\nsomewhere about this part of the world, wasn't she?\" After a moment's\nhesitation he added: \"From something I heard ashore I judge we've a\ncommission to keep a watch out for her as well as to destroy derelicts.\"\n\n\"What about the _Laughing Lass_?\" asked McGuire, the paymaster, a\nNew Englander, who had been in the service but a short time.\n\n\"Good Lord! don't you remember the _Laughing Lass_ mystery and the\ndisappearance of Doctor Schermerhorn?\"\n\n\"Karl Augustus Schermerhorn, the man whose experiments to identify\ntelepathy with the Marconi wireless waves made such a furore in the\npapers?\"\n\n\"Oh, that was only a by-product of his mind. He was an original\ninvestigator in every line of physics and chemistry, besides most of the\nnatural sciences,\" said Barnett. \"The government is particularly\ninterested in him because of his contributions to aerial photography.\"\n\n\"And he was lost with the _Laughing Lass_?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" said Edwards. \"He left San Francisco two years ago on a\nhundred-foot schooner, with an assistant, a big brass-bound chest, and a\nragamuffin crew. A newspaper man named Slade, who dropped out of the\nworld about the same time, is supposed to have gone along, too. Their\nschooner was last sighted about 450 miles northeast of Oahu, in good\nshape, and bound westward. That's all the record of her that there is.\"\n\n\"Was that Ralph Slade?\" asked Barnett.\n\n\"Yes. He was a free-lance writer and artist.\"\n\n\"I knew him well,\" said Barnett. \"He was in our mess in the Philippine\ncampaign, on the _North Dakota_. War correspondent then. It's\nstrange that I never identified him before with the Slade of the\n_Laughing Lass_.\"\n\n\"What was the object of the voyage?\" asked Ives.\n\n\"They were supposed to be after buried treasure,\" said Barnett.\n\n\"I've always thought it more likely that Doctor Schermerhorn was on a\nscientific expedition,\" said Edwards. \"I knew the old boy, and he wasn't\nthe sort to care a hoot in Sheol for treasure, buried or unburied.\"\n\n\"Every time a ship sets out from San Francisco without publishing to all\nthe world just what her business is, all the world thinks it's one of\nthose wild-goose hunts,\" observed Ives.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Barnett. \"Flora and fauna of some unknown island would be\nmuch more in the Schermerhorn line of traffic. Not unlikely that some of\nthe festive natives collected the unfortunate professor.\"\n\nVarious theories were advanced, withdrawn, refuted, defended, and the\ndiscussion carried them through the swift twilight into the darkness\nwhich had been hastened by a high-spreading canopy of storm-clouds.\nAbruptly from the crow's-nest came startling news for those desolate\nseas: \"Light--ho! Two points on the port bow.\"\n\nThe lookout had given extra voice to it. It was plainly heard throughout\nthe ship.\n\nThe group of officers stared in the direction indicated, but could see\nnothing. Presently Ives and Edwards, who were the keenest-sighted, made\nout a faint, suffused radiance. At the same time came a second hail from\nthe crow's-nest.\n\n\"On deck, sir.\"\n\n\"Hello,\" responded Carter, the officer of the deck.\n\n\"There's a light here I can't make anything out of, sir.\"\n\n\"What's it like?\"\n\n\"Sort of a queer general glow.\"\n\n\"General glow, indeed!\" muttered Forsythe, among the group aft. \"That\nfellow's got an imagination.\"\n\n\"Can't you describe it better than that?\" called Carter.\n\n\"Don't make it out at all, sir. 'Tain't any regular and proper light.\nLooks like a lamp in a fog.\"\n\nAmong themselves the officers discussed it interestedly, as it grew\nplainer.\n\n\"Not unlike the electric glow above a city, seen from a distance,\" said\nBarnett, as it grew plainer.\n\n\"Yes: but the nearest electric-lighted city is some eight hundred miles\naway,\" objected Ives.\n\n\"Mirage, maybe,\" suggested Edwards.\n\n\"Pretty hard-working mirage, to cover that distance\" said Ives. \"Though\nI've seen 'em----\"\n\n\"Great heavens! Look at that!\" shouted Edwards.\n\nA great shaft of pale brilliance shot up toward the zenith. Under it\nwhirled a maelstrom of varied radiance, pale with distance, but\nmarvellously beautiful. Forsythe passed them with a troubled face, on his\nway below to report, as his relief went up.\n\n\"The quartermaster reports the compass behaving queerly,\" he said.\n\nThree minutes later the captain was on the bridge. The great ship had\nswung, and they were speeding direct for the phenomenon. But within a few\nminutes the light had died out.\n\n\"Another sea mystery to add to our list,\" said Billy Edwards. \"Did anyone\never see a show like that before? What do you think, Doc?\"\n\n\"Humph!\" grunted the veteran. \"New to me. Volcanic, maybe.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE _LAUGHING LASS_\n\n\nThe falling of dusk on June the 3d found tired eyes aboard the\n_Wolverine_. Every officer in her complement had kept a private and\npersonal lookout all day for some explanation of the previous night's\nphenomenon. All that rewarded them were a sky filmed with lofty clouds,\nand the holiday parade of the epauletted waves.\n\nNor did evening bring a repetition of that strange glow. Midnight found\nthe late stayers still deep in the discussion.\n\n\"One thing is certain,\" said Ives. \"It wasn't volcanic.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" asked the paymaster.\n\n\"Because volcanoes are mostly stationary, and we headed due for that\nlight.\"\n\n\"Yes; but did we keep headed?\" said Barnett, who was navigating officer\nas well as ordnance officer, in a queer voice.\n\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" asked Edwards eagerly.\n\n\"After the light disappeared the compass kept on varying. The stars were\nhidden. There is no telling just where we were headed for some time.\"\n\n\"Then we might be fifty miles from the spot we aimed at.\"\n\n\"Hardly that,\" said the navigator. \"We could guide her to some extent by\nthe direction of wind and waves. If it was volcanic we ought certainly to\nhave sighted it by now.\"\n\n\"Always some electricity in volcanic eruptions,\" said Trendon. \"Makes\ncompass cut didoes. Seen it before.\"\n\n\"Where?\" queried Carter.\n\n\"Off Martinique. Pelee eruption. Needle chased its tail like a kitten.\"\n\n\"Are there many volcanoes hereabouts?\" somebody asked.\n\n\"We're in 162 west, 31 north, about,\" said Barnett. \"No telling whether\nthere are or not. There weren't at last accounts, but that's no evidence\nthat there aren't some since. They come up in the night, these volcanic\nislands.\"\n\n\"Just cast an eye on the charts,\" said Billy Edwards. \"Full of E. D.'s\nand P. D.'s all over the shop. Every one of 'em volcanic.\"\n\n\"E. D.'s and P. D.'s?\" queried the paymaster.\n\n\"Existence doubtful, and position doubtful,\" explained the ensign. \"Every\ntime the skipper of one of these wandering trade ships gets a speck in\nhis eye, he reports an island. If he really does bump into a rock he cuts\nin an arithmetic book for his latitude and longitude and lets it go at\nthat. That's how the chart makers make a living, getting out new editions\nevery few months.\"\n\n\"But it's a fact that these seas are constantly changing,\" said Barnett.\n\"They're so little travelled that no one happens to be around to see an\nisland born. I don't suppose there's a part on the earth's surface more\nliable to seismic disturbances than this region.\"\n\n\"Seismic!\" cried Billy Edwards, \"I should say it was seismic! Why, when a\nnative of one of these island groups sets his heart on a particular loaf\nof bread up his bread-fruit tree, he doesn't bother to climb after it.\nJust waits for some earthquake to happen along and shake it down to him.\"\n\n\"Good boy, Billy,\" said Dr. Trendon, approvingly. \"Do another.\"\n\n\"It's a fact,\" said the ensign, heatedly. \"Why, a couple of years back\nthere was a trader here stocked up with a lot of belly-mixture in\nbottles. Thought he was going to make his pile because there'd been a\ncolic epidemic in the islands the season before. Bottles were labelled\n'Do not shake.' That settled his business. Might as well have marked 'em\n'Keep frozen' in this part of the world. Fellow went broke.\"\n\n\"In any case,\" said Barnett, \"such a glow as that we sighted last night\nI've never seen from any volcano.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Trendon. \"Don't prove it mightn't have been.\"\n\n\"I'll just bet the best dinner in San Francisco that it isn't,\" said\nEdwards.\n\n\"You're on,\" said Carter.\n\n\"Let me in,\" suggested Ives.\n\n\"And I'll take one of it,\" said McGuire.\n\n\"Come one, come all,\" said Edwards cheerily. \"I'll live high on the\ncollective bad judgment of this outfit.\"\n\n\"To-night isn't likely to settle it, anyhow,\" said Ives. \"I move we turn\nin.\"\n\nExpectant minds do not lend themselves to sound slumber. All night the\nofficers of the _Wolverine_ slept on the verge of waking, but it was\nnot until dawn that the cry of \"Sail-ho!\" sent them all hurrying to their\nclothes. Ordinarily officers of the U.S. Navy do not scuttle on deck like\na crowd of curious schoolgirls, but all hands had been keyed to a high\npitch over the elusive light, and the bet with Edwards now served as an\nexcuse for the betrayal of unusual eagerness. Hence the quarter-deck was\nsoon alive with men who were wont to be deep in dreams at that hour.\n\nThey found Carter, whose watch on deck it was, reprimanding the lookout.\n\n\"No, sir,\" the man was insisting, \"she didn't show no light, sir. I'd 'a'\nsighted her an hour ago, sir, if she had.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Carter grimly. \"Who's your relief?\"\n\n\"Sennett.\"\n\n\"Let him take your place. Go aloft, Sennett.\"\n\nAs the lookout, crestfallen and surly, went below, Barnett said in\nsubdued tones:\n\n\"Upon my word, I shouldn't be surprised if the man were right. Certainly\nthere's something queer about that hooker. Look how she handles herself.\"\n\nThe vessel was some three miles to windward. She was a schooner of the\ncommon two-masted Pacific type, but she was comporting herself in a\nmanner uncommon on the Pacific, or any other ocean. Even as Barnett\nspoke, she heeled well over, and came rushing up into the wind, where she\nstood with all sails shaking. Slowly she paid off again, bearing away\nfrom them. Now she gathered full headway, yet edged little by little to\nwindward again.\n\n\"Mighty queer tactics,\" muttered Edwards. \"I think she's steering\nherself.\"\n\n\"Good thing she carries a weather helm,\" commented Ives, who was an\nexpert on sailing rigs. \"Most of that type do. Otherwise she'd have jibed\nher masts out, running loose that way.\"\n\nCaptain Parkinson appeared on deck and turned his glasses for a full\nminute on the strange schooner.\n\n\"Aloft there,\" he hailed the crow's-nest. \"Do you make out anyone\naboard?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" came the answer.\n\n\"Mr. Carter, have the chief quartermaster report on deck with the signal\nflags.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Aren't we going to run up to her?\" asked McGuire, turning in surprise to\nEdwards.\n\n\"And take the risk of getting a hole punched in our pretty paint, with\nher running amuck that way? Not much!\"\n\nUp came the signal quartermaster to get his orders, and there ensued a\none-sided conversation in the pregnant language of the sea.\n\n\"What ship is that?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Are you in trouble?\" asked the cruiser, and waited. The schooner showed\na bare and silent main-peak.\n\n\"Heave to.\" Now Uncle Sam was giving orders.\n\nBut the other paid no heed.\n\n\"We'll make that a little more emphatic,\" said Captain Parkinson. A\nmoment later there was the sharp crash of a gun and a shot went across\nthe bows of the sailing vessel. Hastened by a flaw of wind that veered\nfrom the normal direction of the breeze the stranger made sharply to\nwindward, as if to obey.\n\n\"Ah, there she comes,\" ran the comment along the cruiser's quarter-deck.\n\nBut the schooner, after standing for a moment, all flapping, answered\nanother flaw, and went wide about on the opposite tack.\n\n\"Derelict,\" remarked Captain Parkinson. \"She seems to be in good shape,\ntoo, Dr. Trendon!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The surgeon went to the captain, and the others could hear\nhis deep, abrupt utterance in reply to some question too low for their\nears.\n\n\"Might be, sir. Beri-beri, maybe. More likely smallpox if anything of\nthat kind. But _some_ of 'em would be on deck.\"\n\n\"Whew! A plague ship!\" said Billy Edwards. \"Just my luck to be ordered to\nboard her.\" He shivered slightly.\n\n\"Scared, Billy?\" said Ives. Edwards had a record for daring which made\nthis joke obvious enough to be safe.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to have my peculiar style of beauty spoiled by smallpox\nmarks,\" said the ensign, with a smile on his homely, winning face. \"And\nI've a hunch that that ship is not a lucky find for this ship.\"\n\n\"Then I've a hunch that your hunch is a wrong one,\" said Ives. \"How long\nwould you guess that craft to be?\"\n\n[Illustration: A schooner comporting herself in a manner uncommon on the\nPacific]\n\nThey were now within a mile of the schooner. Edwards scrutinised her\ncalculatingly.\n\n\"Eighty to ninety feet.\"\n\n\"Say 150 tons. And she's a two-masted schooner, isn't she?\" continued\nIves, insinuatingly.\n\n\"She certainly is.\"\n\n\"Well, I've a hunch that that ship is a lucky find for any ship, but\nparticularly for this ship.\"\n\n\"Great Caesar!\" cried the ensign excitedly. \"Do you think it's\n_her_?\"\n\nA buzz of electric interest went around the group. Every glass was\nraised; every eye strained toward her stern to read the name as she\nveered into the wind again. About she came. A sharp sigh of excited\ndisappointment exhaled from the spectators. The name had been painted\nout.\n\n\"No go,\" breathed Edwards. \"But I'll bet another dinner----\"\n\n\"Mr. Edwards,\" called the captain. \"You will take the second cutter,\nboard that schooner, and make a full investigation.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Take your time. Don't come alongside until she is in the wind. Leave\nenough men aboard to handle her.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe cruiser steamed to within half a mile of the aimless traveller, and\nthe small boat put out. Not one of his fellows but envied the young\nensign as he left the ship, steered by Timmins, a veteran bo's'n's mate,\nwise in all the ins and outs of sea ways. They saw him board, neatly\nrunning the small boat under the schooner's counter; they saw the\nforesheet eased off and the ship run up into the wind; then the foresail\ndropped and the wheel lashed so that she would stand so. They awaited the\nreappearance of Edwards and the bo's'n's mate when they had vanished\nbelow decks, and with an intensity of eagerness they followed the return\nof the small boat.\n\nBilly Edwards's face as he came on deck was a study. It was alight with\nexcitement; yet between the eyes two deep wrinkles of puzzlement\nquivered. Such a face the mathematician bends above his paper when some\nobstructive factor arises between him and his solution.\n\n\"Well, sir?\" There was a hint of effort at restraint in the captain's\nvoice.\n\n\"She's the _Laughing Lass_, sir. Everything ship-shape, but not a\nsoul aboard.\"\n\n\"Come below, Mr. Edwards,\" said the captain. And they went, leaving\nbehind them a boiling cauldron of theory and conjecture.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE DEATH SHIP\n\n\nBilly Edwards came on deck with a line of irritation right-angling the\nfurrows between his eyes.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" the quarter-deck bade him, seeing him aflush with\ninformation.\n\n\"The captain won't believe me,\" blurted out Edwards.\n\n\"Is it as bad as that?\" asked Barnett, smiling.\n\n\"It certainly is,\" replied the younger man seriously. \"I don't know that\nI blame him. I'd hardly believe it myself if I hadn't----\"\n\n\"Oh, go on. Out with it. Give us the facts. Never mind your credibility.\"\n\n\"The facts are that there lies the _Laughing Lass_, a little\nweather-worn, but sound as a dollar, and not a living being aboard of\nher. Her boats are all there. Everything's in good condition, though none\ntoo orderly. Pitcher half full of fresh water in the rack. Sails all O.\nK. Ashes of the galley fire still warm. I tell you, gentlemen, that ship\nhasn't been deserted more than a couple of days at the outside.\"\n\n\"Are you sure all the boats are there?\" asked Ives.\n\n\"Dory, dingy, and two surf boats. Isn't that enough?\"\n\n\"Plenty.\"\n\n\"Been over her, inside and out. No sign of collision. No leak. No\nanything, except that the starboard side is blistered a bit. No evidence\nof fire anywhere else. I tell you,\" said Billy Edwards pathetically,\n\"it's given me a headache.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's one of those cases of panic that Forsythe spoke of the\nother night,\" said Ives. \"The crew got frightened at something and ran\naway, with the devil after them.\"\n\n\"But crews don't just step out and run around the corner and hide, when\nthey're scared,\" objected Barnett.\n\n\"That's true, too,\" assented Ives. \"Well, perhaps that volcanic eruption\njarred them so that they jumped for it.\"\n\n\"Pretty wild theory, that,\" said Edwards.\n\n\"No wilder than the facts, as you give them,\" was the retort.\n\n\"That's so,\" admitted the ensign gloomily.\n\n\"But how about pestilence?\" suggested Barnett.\n\n\"Maybe they died fast and the last survivor, after the bodies of the rest\nwere overboard, got delirious and jumped after them.\"\n\n\"Not if the galley fire was hot,\" said Dr. Trendon, briefly. \"No;\npestilence doesn't work that way.\"\n\n\"Did you look at the wheel, Billy?\" asked Ives.\n\n\"Did I! There's another thing. Wheel's all right, but compass is no good\nat all. It's regularly bewitched.\"\n\n\"What about the log, then?\"\n\n\"Couldn't find it anywhere. Hunted high, low, jack, and the game;\neverywhere except in the big, brass-bound chest I found in the captain's\ncabin. Couldn't break into that.\"\n\n\"Dr. Schermerhorn's chest!\" exclaimed Barnett. \"Then he was aboard.\"\n\n\"Well, he isn't aboard now,\" said the ensign grimly. \"Not in the flesh.\nAnd that's all,\" he added suddenly.\n\n\"No; it isn't all,\" said Barnett gently. \"There's something else.\nCaptain's orders?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Captain Parkinson doesn't take enough stock in my report to tell\nme to withhold anything,\" said Edwards, with a trace of bitterness in his\nvoice. \"It's nothing that I believe myself, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Give _us_ a chance to believe it,\" said Ives.\n\n\"Well,\" said the ensign hesitantly, \"there's a sort of atmosphere about\nthat schooner that's almost uncanny.\"\n\n\"Oh, you had the shudders before you were ordered to board,\" bantered\nIves.\n\n\"I know it. I'd have thought it was one of those fool presentiments if I\nwere the only one to feel it. But the men were affected, too. They kept\ntogether like frightened sheep. And I heard one say to another: 'Hey,\nBoney, d'you feel like someone was a-buzzin' your nerves like a\nfiddle-string?' Now,\" demanded Edwards plaintively, \"what right has a\njackie to have nerves?\"\n\n\"That's strange enough about the compass,\" said Barnett slowly. \"Ours is\nall right again. The schooner must have been so near the electric\ndisturbance that her instruments were permanently deranged.\"\n\n\"That would lend weight to the volcanic theory,\" said Carter.\n\n\"So the captain didn't take kindly to your go-look-see?\" questioned Ives\nof Edwards.\n\n\"As good as told me I'd missed the point of the thing,\" said the ensign,\nflushing. \"Perhaps he can make more of it himself. At any rate, he's\ngoing to try. Here he is now.\"\n\n\"Dr. Trendon,\" said the captain, appearing. \"You will please to go with\nme to the schooner.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the surgeon, rising from his chair with such alacrity as\nto draw from Ives the sardonic comment:\n\n\"Why, I actually believe old Trendon is excited.\"\n\nFor two hours after the departure of the captain and Trendon there were\ndull times on the quarter-deck of the _Wolverine_. Then the surgeon\ncame back to them.\n\n\"Billy was right,\" he said.\n\n\"But he didn't tell us anything,\" cried Ives. \"He didn't clear up the\nmystery.\"\n\n\"That's what,\" said Trendon. \"One thing Billy said,\" he added, waxing\nunusually prolix for him, \"was truer than maybe he knew.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" murmured the ensign. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"You said 'Not a living being aboard.' Exact words, hey?\"\n\n\"Well, what of it?\" exclaimed the ensign excitedly. \"You don't mean you\nfound dead----?\"\n\n\"Keep your temperature down, my boy. No. You were exactly right. Not a\nliving being aboard.\"\n\n\"Thanks for nothing,\" retorted the ensign.\n\n\"Neither human nor other,\" pursued Trendon.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Food scattered around the galley. Crumbs on the mess table. Ever see a\nwooden ship without cockroaches?\"\n\n\"Never particularly investigated the matter.\"\n\n\"Don't believe such a thing exists,\" said Ives.\n\n\"Not a cockroach on the _Laughing Lass_. Ever know of an old hooker\nthat wasn't overrun with rats?\"\n\n\"No; nor anyone else. Not above water.\"\n\n\"Found a dozen dead rats. No sound or sign of a live one on the\n_Laughing Lass_. No rats, no mice. No bugs. Gentlemen, the\n_Laughing Lass_ is a charnel ship.\"\n\n\"No wonder Billy's tender nerves went wrong.\" said Ives, with\nirrepressible flippancy. \"She's probably haunted by cockroach wraiths.\"\n\n\"He'll have a chance to see,\" said Trendon. \"Captain's going to put him\nin charge.\"\n\n\"By way of apology, then,\" said Barnett. \"That's pretty square.\"\n\n\"Captain Parkinson wishes to see you in his cabin, Mr. Edwards,\" said an\norderly, coming in.\n\n\"A pleasant voyage, Captain Billy,\" said Ives. \"Sing out if the goblins\ngit yer.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later Ensign Edwards, with a quartermaster, Timmins, the\nbo's'n's mate, and a crew, was heading a straight course toward his first\ncommand, with instructions to \"keep company and watch for signals\"; and\nintention to break into the brass-bound chest and ferret out what clue\nlay there, if it took dynamite. As he boarded, Barnett and Trendon, with\nboth of whom the lad was a favourite, came to a sinister conclusion.\n\n\"It's poison, I suppose,\" said the first officer.\n\n\"And a mighty subtle sort,\" agreed Trendon. \"Don't like the looks of it.\"\nHe shook a solemn head. \"Don't like it for a damn.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE SECOND PRIZE CREW\n\n\nIn semi-tropic Pacific weather the unexpected so seldom happens as to be\na negligible quantity. The _Wolverine_ met with it on June 5th. From\nsome unaccountable source in that realm of the heaven-scouring trades\ncame a heavy mist. Possibly volcanic action, deranging by its electric\nand gaseous outpourings the normal course of the winds, had given birth\nto it. Be that as it may, it swept down upon the cruiser, thickening as\nit approached, until presently it had spread a curtain between the\nwarship and its charge. The wind died. Until after fall of night the\n_Wolverine_ moved slowly, bellowing for the schooner, but got no\nreply. Once they thought they heard a distant shout of response, but\nthere was no repetition.\n\n\"Probably doesn't carry any fog horn,\" said Carter bitterly, voicing a\ngeneral uneasiness.\n\n\"No log; compass crazy; without fog signal; I don't like that craft.\nBarnett ought to have been ordered to blow the damned thing up, as a\nperil to the high seas.\"\n\n\"We'll pick her up in the morning, surely,\" said Forsythe. \"This can't\nlast for ever.\"\n\nNor did it last long. An hour before midnight a pounding shower fell,\nlashing the sea into phosphorescent whiteness. It ceased, and with the\ngrowl of a leaping animal a squall furiously beset the ship. Soon the\ngreat steel body was plunging and heaving in the billows. It was a gloomy\ncompany about the wardroom table. Upon each and all hung an oppression of\nspirit. Captain Parkinson came from his cabin and went on deck.\nConstitutionally he was a nervous and pessimistic man with a fixed belief\nin the conspiracy of events, banded for the undoing of him and his. Blind\nor dubious conditions racked his soul, but real danger found him not only\nprepared, but even eager. Now his face was a picture of foreboding.\n\n\"Parky looks as if Davy Jones was pulling on his string,\" observed the\nflippant Ives to his neighbour.\n\n\"Worrying about the schooner. Hope Billy Edwards saw or heard or felt\nthat squall coming,\" replied Forsythe, giving expression to the anxiety\nthat all felt.\n\n\"He's a good sailor man,\" said Ives, \"and that's a staunch little\nschooner, by the way she handled herself.\"\n\n\"Oh, it will be all right,\" said Carter confidently. \"The wind's\nmoderating now.\"\n\n\"But there's no telling how far out of the course this may have blown\nhim.\"\n\nBarnett came down, dripping.\n\n\"Anything new?\" asked Dr. Trendon.\n\nThe navigating officer shook his head.\n\n\"Nothing. But the captain's in a state of mind,\" he said.\n\n\"What's wrong with him?\"\n\n\"The schooner. Seems possessed with the notion that there's something\nwrong with her.\"\n\n\"Aren't you feeling a little that way yourself?\" said Forsythe. \"I am.\nI'll take a look around before I turn in.\"\n\nHe left behind him a silent crowd. His return was prompt and swift.\n\n\"Come on deck,\" he said.\n\nEvery man leaped as to an order. There was that in Forsythe's voice which\nstung. The weather had cleared somewhat, though scudding wrack still blew\nacross them to the westward. The ship rolled heavily. Of the sea naught\nwas visible except the arching waves, but in the sky they beheld again,\nwith a sickening sense of disaster, that pale and lovely glow which had\nso bewildered them two nights before.\n\n\"The aurora!\" cried McGuire, the paymaster.\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" replied Ives, with sarcasm. \"Dead in the west. Common\nspot for the aurora. Particularly on the edge of the South Seas, where\nthey are thick!\"\n\n\"Then what is it?\"\n\nNobody had an answer. Carter hastened forward and returned to report.\n\n\"It's electrical anyway,\" said Carter. \"The compass is queer again.\"\n\n\"Edwards ought to be close to the solution of it,\" ventured Ives. \"This\ngale should have blown him just about to the centre of interest.\"\n\n\"If only he isn't involved in it,\" said Carter anxiously.\n\n\"What could there be to involve him?\" asked McGuire.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Carter slowly. \"Somehow I feel as if the desertion\nof the schooner was in some formidable manner connected with that light.\"\n\nFor perhaps fifteen minutes the glow continued. It seemed to be nearer at\nhand than on the former sighting; but it took no comprehensible form.\nThen it died away and all was blackness again. But the officers of the\n_Wolverine_ had long been in troubled slumber before the sensitive\ncompass regained its exact balance, and with the shifting wind to mislead\nher, the cruiser had wandered, by morning, no man might know how far from\nher course.\n\nAll day long of June 6th the _Wolverine_, baffled by patches of mist\nand moving rain-squalls, patrolled the empty seas without sighting the\nlost schooner. The evening brought an envelope of fog again, and\npresently a light breeze came up from the north. An hour of it had failed\nto disperse the mist, when there was borne down to the warship a flapping\nsound as of great wings. The flapping grew louder--waned--ceased--and\nfrom the lookout came a hail.\n\n\"Ship's lights three points on the starboard quarter.\"\n\n\"What do you make it out to be?\" came the query from below.\n\n\"Green light's all I can see, sir.\" There was a pause.\n\n\"There's her port light, now. Looks to be turning and bearing down on us,\nsir. Coming dead for us\"--the man's voice rose--\"close aboard; less'n two\nship's lengths away!\"\n\nAs for a prearranged scene, the fog-curtain parted. There loomed silently\nand swiftly the _Laughing Lass_. Down she bore upon the greater\nvessel until it seemed as if she must ram; but all the time she was\nveering to windward, and now she ran into the wind with a castanet rattle\nof sails. So close aboard was she that the eager eyes of Uncle Sam's men\npeered down upon her empty decks--for she was void of life.\n\nBehind the cruiser's blanketing she paid off very slowly, but presently\ncaught the breeze full and again whitened the water at her prow.\nForgetting regulations, Ives hailed loudly:\n\n\"Ahoy, _Laughing Lass_! Ahoy, Billy Edwards!\"\n\nNo sound, no animate motion came from aboard that apparition, as she fell\nastern. A shudder of horror ran across the _Wolverine_'s\nquarter-deck. A wraith ship, peopled with skeletons, would have been less\ndreadful to their sight than the brisk and active desolation of the\nheeling schooner.\n\n\"Been deserted since early last night,\" said Trendon hoarsely.\n\n\"How can you tell that?\" asked Barnett.\n\n\"Both sails reefed down. Ready for that squall. Been no weather since to\ncall for reefs. Must have quit her during the squall.\"\n\n\"Then they jumped,\" cried Carter, \"for I saw her boats. It isn't\nbelievable.\"\n\n\"Neither was the other,\" said Trendon grimly.\n\nA hurried succession of orders stopped further discussion for the time.\nIves was sent aboard the schooner to lower sail and report. He came back\nwith a staggering dearth of information. The boats were all there; the\nship was intact--as intact as when Billy Edwards had taken charge--but\nthe cheery, lovable ensign and his men had vanished without trace or\nclue. As to the how or the wherefore they might rack their brains without\nguessing. There was the beginning of a log in the ensign's handwriting,\nwhich Ives had found with high excitement and read with bitter\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Had squall from northeast,\" it ran. \"Double reefed her and she took it\nnicely. Seems a seaworthy, quick ship. Further search for log. No result.\nHave ordered one of crew who is a bit of a mechanic to work at the\nbrass-bound chest till he gets it open. He reports marks on the lock as\nif somebody had been trying to pick it before him.\"\n\nThere was no further entry.\n\n\"Dr. Trendon is right,\" said Barnett. \"Whatever happened--and God only\nknows what it could have been--it happened just after the squall.\"\n\n\"Just about the time of the strange glow,\" cried Ives.\n\nIt was decided that two men and a petty officer should be sent aboard the\n_Laughing Lass_ to make her fast with a cable, and remain on board\nover night. But when the order was given the men hung back. One of them\nprotested brokenly that he was sick. Trendon, after examination, reported\nto the captain.\n\n\"Case of blue funk, sir. Might as well be sick. Good for nothing. Others\naren't much better.\"\n\n\"Who was to be in charge?\"\n\n\"Congdon,\" replied the doctor, naming one of the petty officers.\n\n\"He's my coxswain,\" said Captain Parkinson. \"A first-class man. I can\nhardly believe that he is afraid. We'll see.\"\n\n[Illustration: A man who was a bit of a mechanic was set to work to open\nthe chest]\n\nCongdon was sent for.\n\n\"You're ordered aboard the schooner for the night, Congdon,\" said the\ncaptain.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Is there any reason why you do not wish to go?\"\n\nThe man hesitated, looking miserable. Finally he blurted out, not without\na certain dignity:\n\n\"I obey orders, sir.\"\n\n\"Speak out, my man,\" urged the captain kindly.\n\n\"Well, sir: it's Mr. Edwards, then. You couldn't scare him off a ship,\nsir, unless it was something--something----\"\n\nHe stopped, failing of the word.\n\n\"You know what Mr. Edwards was, sir, for pluck,\" he concluded.\n\n\"_Was_!\" cried the captain sharply. \"What do you mean?\n\n\"The schooner got him, sir. You don't make no doubt of that, do you,\nsir?\" The man spoke in a hushed voice, with a shrinking glance back of\nhim.\n\n\"Will you go aboard under Mr. Ives?\"\n\n\"Anywhere my officer goes I'll go, and gladly, sir.\"\n\nIves was sent aboard in charge. For that night, in a light breeze, the\ntwo ships lay close together, the schooner riding jauntily astern. But\nnot until morning illumined the world of waters did the\n_Wolverine_'s people feel confident that the _Laughing Lass_\nwould not vanish away from their ken like a shape of the mist.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE DISAPPEARANCE\n\n\nWhen Barnett come on deck very early in the morning of June 7th, he found\nDr. Trendon already up and staring moodily out at the _Laughing\nLass_. As the night was calm the tow had made fair time toward their\nport in the Hawaiian group. The surgeon was muttering something which\nseemed to Barnett to be in a foreign tongue.\n\n\"Thought out any clue, doctor?\" asked the first officer.\n\n\"_Petit Chel_--Pshaw! _Jolie Celimene!_ No,\" muttered Trendon.\n\"_Marie--Marie_--I've got it! The _Marie Celeste_.\"\n\n\"Got what? What about her?\"\n\n\"Parallel case,\" said Trendon. \"Sailed from New York back in the\nseventies. Seven weeks out was found derelict. Everything in perfect\norder. Captain's wife's hem on the machine. Boats all accounted for. No\nsign of struggle. Log written to within forty-eight hours.\"\n\n\"What became of the crew?\"\n\n\"Wish I could tell you. Might help to unravel our tangle.\" He shook his\nhead in sudden, unwonted passion.\n\n\"Evidently there's something criminal in her record,\" said Barnett,\nfrowning at the fusty schooner astern. \"Otherwise the name wouldn't be\npainted out.\"\n\n\"Painted out long ago. See how rusty it is. Schermerhorn's work maybe,\"\nreplied Trendon. \"Secret expedition, remember.\"\n\n\"In the name of wonders, why should he do it?\"\n\n\"Secret expedition, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Um-ah; that's true,\" said the other thoughtfully. \"It's quite possible.\"\n\n\"Captain wishes to see both of you gentlemen in the ward room, if you\nplease,\" came a message.\n\nBelow they found all the officers gathered. Captain Parkinson was pacing\nup and down in ill-controlled agitation.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"we are facing a problem which, so far as I know,\nis without parallel. It is my intention to bring the schooner which we\nhave in tow to port at Honolulu. In the present unsettled weather we\ncannot continue to tow her. I wish two officers to take charge. Under the\ncircumstances I shall issue no orders. The duty must be voluntary.\"\n\nInstantly every man, from the veteran Trendon to the youthful paymaster,\nvolunteered.\n\n\"That is what I expected,\" said Captain Parkinson quietly. \"But I have\nstill a word to say. I make no doubt in my own mind that the schooner has\ntwice been beset by the gravest of perils. Nothing less would have driven\nMr. Edwards from his post. All of us who know him will appreciate that.\nNor can I free myself from the darkest forebodings as to his fate and\nthat of his companions. But as to the nature of the peril I am unable to\nmake any conjecture worthy of consideration. Has anyone a theory to\noffer?\"\n\nThere was a dead silence.\n\n\"Mr. Barnett? Dr. Trendon? Mr. Ives?\"\n\n\"Is there not possibly some connection between the unexplained light\nwhich we have twice seen, and the double desertion of the ship?\"\nsuggested the first officer, after a pause.\n\n\"I have asked myself that over and over. Whatever the source of the light\nand however near to it the schooner may have been, she is evidently\nunharmed.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Barnett. \"That seems to vitiate that explanation.\"\n\n\"I thank you, gentlemen, for the promptitude of your offers,\" continued\nthe captain. \"In this respect you make my duty the more difficult. I\nshall accept Mr. Ives because of his familiarity with sailing craft and\nwith these seas.\" His eyes ranged the group.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Captain Parkinson,\" eagerly put in the paymaster,\n\"but I've handled a schooner yacht for several years and I'd appreciate\nthe chance of----\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. McGuire, you shall be the second in command.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"You gentlemen will pick a volunteer crew and go aboard at once. Spare no\neffort to find records of the schooner's cruise. Keep in company and\nwatch for signals. Report at once any discovery or unusual incident,\nhowever slight.\"\n\nNot so easily was a crew obtained. Having in mind the excusable\nsuperstition of the men, Captain Parkinson was unwilling to compel any of\nthem to the duty. Awed by the mystery of their mates' disappearance, the\nsailors hung back. Finally by temptation of extra prize money, a\ncomplement was made up.\n\nAt ten o'clock of a puffy, mist-laden morning a new and strong crew of\nnine men boarded the _Laughing Lass_. There were no farewells among\nthe officers. Forebodings weighed too heavy for such open expression.\n\nAll the fates of weather seemed to combine to part the schooner from her\nconvoy. As before, the fog fell, only to be succeeded by squally\nrain-showers that cut out the vista into a checkerboard pattern of\nvisible sea and impenetrable greyness. Before evening the _Laughing\nLass_, making slow way through the mists, had become separated by a\nleague of waves from the cruiser. One glimpse of her between mist areas\nthe _Wolverines_ caught at sunset. Then wind and rain descended in\nfurious volume from the southeast. The cruiser immediately headed about,\nfollowing the probable course of her charge, which would be beaten far\ndown to leeward. It was a gloomy mess on the warship. In his cabin,\nCaptain Parkinson was frankly sea-sick: a condition which nothing but the\nextreme of nervous depression ever induced in him.\n\nFor several hours the rain fell and the gale howled. Then the sky swiftly\ncleared, and with the clearing there rose a great cry of amaze from stem\nto stern of the _Wolverine_. For far toward the western horizon\nappeared such a prodigy as the eye of no man aboard that ship had ever\nbeheld. From a belt of marvellous, glowing gold, rich and splendid\nstreamers of light spiralled up into the blackness of the heavens.\n\nIn all the colours of the spectrum they rose and fell; blazing orange,\nsilken, wonderful, translucent blues, and shimmering reds. Below, a broad\nband of paler hue, like sheet lightning fixed to rigidity, wavered and\nrippled. All the auroras of the northland blended in one could but have\npaled away before the splendour of that terrific celestial apparition.\n\nOn board the cruiser all hands stood petrified, bound in a stricture of\nspeechless wonder. After the first cry, silence lay leaden over the ship.\nIt was broken by a scream of terror from forward. The quartermaster who\nhad been at the wheel came clambering down the ladder and ran along the\ndeck, his fingers splayed and stiffened before him in the intensity of\nhis panic.\n\n\"The needle! The compass!\" he shrieked.\n\nBarnett ran to the wheel house with Trendon at his heels. The others\nfollowed. The needle was swaying like a cobra's head. And as a cobra's\nhead spits venom, it spat forth a thin, steel-blue stream of lucent fire.\nThen so swiftly it whirled that the sparks scattered from it in a tiny\nshower. It stopped, quivered, and curved itself upward until it rattled\nlike a fairy drum upon the glass shield. Barnett looked at Trendon.\n\n\"Volcanic?\" he said.\n\n\"'Mine eyes have seen the coming of the glory of the Lord,'\" muttered the\nsurgeon in his deep bass, as he looked forth upon the streaming, radiant\nheavens. \"It's like nothing else.\"\n\nIn the west the splendour and the terror shot to the zenith. Barnett\nwhirled the wheel. The ship responded perfectly.\n\n\"I though she might be bewitched, too,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You may heal her for the light, Mr. Barnett,\" said Captain Parkinson\ncalmly. He had come from his cabin, all his nervous depression gone in\nthe face of an imminent and visible danger.\n\nSlowly the great mass of steel swung to the unknown. For an hour the\nunknown guided her. Then fell blackness, sudden, complete. After that\nradiance the dazzled eye could make out no stars, but the look-out's\nkeen vision discerned something else.\n\n\"Ship afire,\" he shouted hoarsely.\n\n\"Where away?\"\n\n\"Two points to leeward, near where the light was, sir.\"\n\nThey turned their eyes to the direction indicated, and beheld a majestic\nrolling volume of purple light. Suddenly a fiercer red shot it through.\n\n\"That's no ship afire,\" said Trendon. \"Volcano in eruption.\"\n\n\"And the other?\" asked the captain.\n\n\"No volcano, sir.\"\n\n\"Poor Billy Edwards wins his bet,\" said Forsythe, in a low voice.\n\n\"God grant he's on earth to collect it,\" replied Barnett solemnly.\n\nNo one turned in that night. When the sun of June 8th rose, it showed an\nocean bare of prospect except that on the far horizon where the chart\nshowed no land there rose a smudge of dirty rolling smoke. Of the\nschooner there was neither sign nor trace.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE CASTAWAYS\n\n\n\"This ship,\" growled Carter, the second officer, to Dr. Trendon, as they\nstood watching the growing smoke-column, \"is a worse hot-bed of rumours\nthan a down-east village. That's the third sea-gull we've had officially\nreported since breakfast.\"\n\nAs he said, three distinct times the _Wolverine_ had thrilled to an\nimminent discovery, which, upon nearer investigation, had dwindled to\nnothing more than a floating fowl. Upon the heels of Carter's complaint\ncame another hail.\n\n\"Boat ahoy. Three points on the starboard bow.\"\n\n\"If that's another gull,\" muttered Carter, \"I'll have something to say to\nyou, my festive lookout.\"\n\nThe news ran electrically through the cruiser, and all eyes were strained\nfor a glimpse of the boat. The ship swung away to starboard.\n\n\"Let me know as soon as you can make her out,\" ordered Carter.\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\n\n\"There's certainly something there,\" said Forsythe, presently. \"I can\nmake out a speck rising on the waves.\"\n\n\"Bit o' wreckage from Barnett's derelict,\" muttered Trendon, scowling\nthrough his glasses.\n\n\"Rides too high for a spar or anything of that sort,\" said the junior\nlieutenant.\n\n\"She's a small boat,\" came in the clear tones of the lookout, \"driftin'\ndown.\"\n\n\"Anyone in her?\" asked Carter.\n\n\"Can't make out yet, sir. No one's in charge though, sir.\"\n\nCaptain Parkinson appeared and Carter pointed out the speck to him.\n\n\"Yes. Give her full speed,\" said the captain, replying to a question from\nthe officer of the deck.\n\nForward leapt the swift cruiser, all too slow for the anxious hearts of\nthose aboard. For there was not one of the _Wolverines_ who did not\nexpect from this aimless traveller of desert seas at the least a leading\nclue to the riddle that oppressed them.\n\n\"Aloft there!\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\n\n\"Can you make out her build?\"\n\n\"Rides high, like a dory, sir.\"\n\n\"Wasn't there a dory on the _Laughing Lass_?\" cried Forsythe.\n\n\"On her stern davits,\" answered Trendon.\n\n\"It is hardly probable that unattached small boats should be drifting\nabout these seas,\" said Captain Parkinson, thoughtfully. \"If she's a\ndory, she's the _Laughing Lass_'s boat.\"\n\n\"That's what she is,\" said Barnett. \"You can see her build plain enough\nnow.\"\n\n\"Mr. Barnett, will you go aloft and keep me posted?\" said the captain.\n\nThe executive officer climbed to join the lookout. As he ascended, those\nbelow saw the little craft rise high and slow on a broad swell.\n\n\"Same dory,\" said Trendon. \"I'd swear to her in Constantinople.\"\n\n\"What else could she be?\" muttered Forsythe.\n\n\"Somethin' that looks like a man in the bottom of her,\" sang out the\ncrow's-nest. \"Two of 'em, I think.\"\n\nFor five minutes there was stillness aboard, broken only by an occasional\nlow-voiced conjecture. Then from aloft:\n\n\"Two men rolling in the bottom.\"\n\n\"Are they alive?\"\n\n\"No, sir; not that I can see.\"\n\nThe wind, which had been extremely variable since dawn, now whipped\naround a couple of points, swinging the boat's stern to them. Barnet,\nputting aside his glass for a moment, called down:\n\n\"That's the one, sir. I can make out the name.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the captain quietly. \"We should have news, at least.\"\n\n\"Ives or McGuire,\" suggested Forsythe, in low tones.\n\n\"Or Billy Edwards,\" amended Carter.\n\n\"Not Edwards,\" said Trendon.\n\n\"How do you know?\" demanded Forsythe.\n\n\"Dory was aboard when we found her the second time, after Edwards had\nleft.\"\n\n\"Can you make out which of the men are in her?\" hailed the captain.\n\n\"Don't think it's any of our people,\" came the astonishing reply from\nBarnett.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"I can see only one man's face, sir. It isn't Ives or McGuire. He's a\nstranger to me.\"\n\n\"It must be one of the crew, then.\"\n\n\"No, sir, beg your parding,\" called the lookout. \"Nothin' like that in\nour crew, sir.\"\n\nThe boat came down upon them swiftly. Soon the quarter-deck was looking\ninto her. She was of a type common enough on the high seas, except that a\nstep for a mast showed that she had presumably been used for skimming\nabout open shores. Of her passengers, one lay forward, prone and quiet. A\nlength of sail cloth spread over him made it impossible to see his garb.\nAt his breast an ugly protuberance, outlined vaguely, hinted a deformity.\n\nThe other sprawled aft, and at a nearer sight of him some of the men\nbroke out into nervous titters. There was some excuse, for surely such a\nscarecrow had never before been the sport of wind and wave. A thing of\nshreds he was, elaborately ragged, a face overrun with a scrub of beard,\nand preternaturally drawn, surmounted by a stiff-dried, dirty, cloth\nsemi-turban, with a wide, forbidding stain along the side, worked out the\nlikeness to a make-up.\n\n\"My God!\" cackled Forsythe with an hysterical explosion; and again, \"My\nGod!\"\n\nA long-drawn, irrepressible aspiration of expectancy rose from the\nwarship's decks as the stranger raised his haggard face, turned eyes\nunseeingly upon them, and fell back. The forward occupant stirred not,\nsave as the boat rolled.\n\nFrom between decks someone called out, sharply, an order. In the grim\nsilence it seemed strangely incongruous that the measured business of a\nship's life should be going forward as usual. Something within the\nnewcomer's consciousness stirred to that voice of authority.\nMechanically, like some huge, hideous toy, he raised first one arm, then\nthe other, and hitched himself halfway up on the stern seat. His mouth\nopened. His face wrinkled. He seemed groping for the meaning of a joke at\nwhich he knew he ought to laugh. Suddenly from his lips in surprising\nvolume, raucous, rasping, yet with a certain rollicking deviltry fit to\nset the head a-tilt, burst a chanty:\n\n  \"Oh, their coffin was their ship, and their grave it was the sea:\n    _Blow high, blow low, what care we!_\n  And the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea:\n    _Down on the coast of the high Barbaree-ee._\"\n\nLong-drawn, like the mockery of a wail, the minor cadence wavered through\nthe stillness, and died away.\n\n\"The High Barbaree!\" cried Trendon.\n\n\"You know it?\" asked the captain, expectant of a clue.\n\n\"One of those cursed tunes you can't forget,\" said the surgeon. \"Heard a\nscoundrel of a beach-comber sing it years ago. Down in New Zealand, that\nwas. When the fever rose on him he'd pipe up. Used to beat time with a\nsteel hook he wore in place of a hand. The thing haunted me till I was\nsorry I hadn't let the rascal die. This creature might have learned it\nfrom him. Howls it out exactly like.\"\n\n\"I don't see that that helps us any,\" said Forsythe, looking down on the\npreparations that were making to receive the unexpected guests.\n\nWith a deftness which had made the _Wolverine_ famous in the navy\nfor the niceties of seamanship, the great cruiser let down her tackle as\nshe drew skilfully alongside, and made fast, preparatory to lifting the\ndory gently to her broad deck. But before the order came to hoist away,\none of the jackies who had gone down drew the covering back from the\nstill figure forward, and turned it over. With a half-stifled cry he\nshrank back. And at that the tension of soul and mind on the\n_Wolverine_ snapped, breaking into outcries and sudden, sharp\nimprecations. The face revealed was that of Timmins, the bo's'n's mate,\nwho had sailed with the first vanished crew. A life preserver was\nfastened under his arms. He was dead.\n\n\"I'm out,\" said the surgeon briefly, and stood with mouth agape. Never\nhad the disciplined _Wolverines_ performed a sea duty with so ragged\na routine as the getting in of the boat containing the live man and the\ndead body. The dead seaman was reverently disposed and covered. As to the\nsurvivor there was some hesitancy on the part of the captain, who was\ninclined to send him forward until Dr. Trendon, after a swift scrutiny,\nsuggested that for the present, at least, he be berthed aft. They took\nthe stranger to Edwards's vacant room, where Trendon was closeted with\nhim for half an hour. When he emerged he was beset with questions.\n\n\"Can't give any account of himself yet,\" said the surgeon. \"Weak and not\nrightly conscious.\"\n\n\"What ails him?\"\n\n\"Enough. Gash in his scalp. Fever. Thirst and exhaustion. Nervous shock,\ntoo, I think.\"\n\n\"How came he aboard the _Laughing Lass_?\" \"Does he know anything of\nBilly?\" \"Was he a stow-away?\" \"Did you ask him about Ives and McGuire?\"\n\"How came he in the small boat?\" \"Where are the rest?\"\n\n\"Now, now,\" said the veteran chidingly. \"How can I tell? Would you have\nme kill the man with questions?\"\n\nHe left them to look at the body of the bo's'n's mate. Not a word had he\nto say when he returned. Only the captain got anything out of him but\ngrowling and unintelligible expressions, which seemed to be objurgatory\nand to express bewildered cogitation.\n\n\"How long had poor Timmins been drowned?\" the captain had asked him, and\nTrendon replied:\n\n\"Captain Parkinson, the man wasn't drowned. No water in his lungs.\"\n\n\"Not drowned! Then how came he by his death?\"\n\n\"If I were to diagnose it under any other conditions I should say that he\nhad inhaled flames.\"\n\nThen the two men stared at each other in blank impotency. Meantime the\nscarecrow was showing signs of returning consciousness and a message was\ndispatched for the physician. On his way he met Barnett, who asked and\nreceived permission to accompany him. The stranger was tossing restlessly\nin his bunk, opening and shutting his parched mouth in silent, piteous\nappeal for the water that must still be doled to him parsimoniously.\n\n\"I think I'll try him with a little brandy,\" said Trendon, and sent for\nthe liquor.\n\nBarnett raised the patient while the surgeon held the glass to his lips.\nThe man's hand rose, wavered, and clasped the glass.\n\n\"All right, my friend. Take it yourself, if you like,\" said Trendon.\n\nThe fingers closed. Tremulously held, the little glass tilted and rattled\nagainst the teeth. There was one deep, eager spasm of swallowing. Then\nthe fevered eyes opened upon the face of the _Wolverine_'s first\nofficer.\n\n\"Prosit, Barnett,\" said the man, in a voice like the rasp of rusty metal.\n\nThe navy man straightened up as from a blow under the jaw.\n\n\"Be careful what you are about,\" warned Trendon, addressing his superior\nofficer sharply, for Barnett had all but let his charge drop. His face\nwas a puckered mask of amaze and incredulity.\n\n\"Did you hear him speak my name--or am I dreaming?\" he half whispered.\n\n\"Heard him plain enough. Who is he?\"\n\nThe man's eyes closed, but he smiled a little--a singular, wry-mouthed,\nwinning smile. With that there sprung from behind the brush of beard,\nfilling out the deep lines of emaciation, a memory to the recognition of\nBarnett; a keen and gay countenance that whisked him back across seven\nyears time to the days of Dewey and the Philippines.\n\n\"Ralph Slade, by the Lord!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Of the _Laughing Lass_?\" cried Trendon.\n\n\"Of the _Laughing Lass_.\"\n\nSuch a fury of eagerness burned in the face of Barnett that Trendon\ncautioned him. \"See here, Mr. Barnett, you're not going to fire a\nbroadside of disturbing questions at my patient yet a while. He's in no\ncondition.\"\n\nBut it was from the other that the questions came. Opening his eyes he\nwhispered, \"The sailor? Where?\"\n\n\"Dead,\" said Trendon bluntly. Then, breaking his own rule of repression,\nhe asked:\n\n\"Did he come off the schooner with you?\"\n\n\"Picked him up,\" was the straining answer. \"Drifting.\"\n\nThe survivor looked around him, then into Barnett's face, and his mind\ntoo, traversed the years.\n\n\"_North Dakota?_\" he queried.\n\n\"No; I've changed my ship,\" said Barnett. \"This is the _Wolverine_.\"\n\n\"Where's the _Laughing Lass_?\"\n\nBarnett shook his head.\n\n\"Tell me,\" begged Slade.\n\n\"Wait till you're stronger,\" admonished Trendon.\n\n\"Can't wait,\" said the weak voice. The eyes grew wild.\n\n\"Mr. Barnett, tell him the bare outline and make it short,\" said the\nsurgeon.\n\n\"We sighted the _Laughing Lass_ two days ago. She was in good shape,\nbut deserted. That is, we thought she was deserted.\"\n\nThe man nodded eagerly.\n\n\"I suppose you were aboard,\" said Barnett, and Trendon made a quick\ngesture of impatience and rebuke.\n\n\"No,\" said Slade. \"Left three--four--don't know how many nights ago.\"\n\nThe officers looked at each other. \"Go on,\" said Trendon to his\ncompanion.\n\n\"We put a crew aboard in command of an ensign,\" continued Barnett, \"and\npicked up the schooner the next night, deserted. You must know about it.\nWhere is Billy Edwards?\"\n\n\"Never heard of him,\" whispered the other.\n\n\"Ives and McGuire, then. They were there after--Great God, man!\" he\ncried, his agitation breaking out, \"Pull yourself together! Give us\nsomething to go on.\"\n\n\"Mr. Barnett!\" said the surgeon peremptorily.\n\nBut the suggestion was working in the sick man's brain. He turned to the\nofficers a face of horror.\n\n\"Your man, Edwards--the crew--they left her? In the night?\"\n\n\"What does he mean?\" cried Barnett.\n\n\"The light! You saw it?\"\n\n\"Yes; we saw a strange light,\" answered Trendon soothingly. Slade half\nrose. \"Lost; all lost!\" he cried, and fell back unconscious. Trendon\nexploded into curses. \"See what you've done to my patient,\" he fumed.\nBarnett looked at him with contrite eyes.\n\n\"Better get out before he comes to,\" growled the surgeon. \"Nice way to\ntreat a man half dead of exhaustion.\"\n\nIt was nearly an hour before Slade came back to the world again. The\ndoctor forbade him to attempt speech. But of one thing he would not be\ndenied. There was a struggle for utterance, then:\n\n\"The volcano?\" he rasped out.\n\n\"Dead ahead,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Stand by!\" grasped Slade. He strove to rise, to say something further,\nbut endurance had reached its limit. The man was utterly done.\n\nDr. Trendon went on deck, his head sunk between his shoulders. For a\nminute he was in earnest talk with the captain. Presently the\n_Wolverine_'s engines slowed down, and she lay head to the waves,\nwith just enough turn of the screw to hold her against the sea-way.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nTHE FREE LANCE\n\n\nBy the following afternoon Dr. Trendon reported his patient as quite\nrecovered.\n\n\"Starved for water,\" proffered the surgeon. \"Tissues fairly dried out.\nSoaked him up. Fed him broth. Put him to sleep. He's all right. Just\nwakes up to eat; then off again like a two-year old. Wonderful\nconstitution.\"\n\n\"The gentleman wants to know if he can come on deck, sir,\" saluted an\norderly.\n\n\"Waked up, eh. Come on, Barnett. Help me boost him on deck.\"\n\nThe two officers disappeared to return in a moment arm-in-arm with Ralph\nSlade.\n\nNearly twenty-four hours' rest and skilful treatment had done wonders. He\nwas still a trifle weak and uncertain, was still a little glad to lean on\nthe arms of his companions, but his eye was bright and alert, and his\nhollow cheeks mounted a slight colour. This, with the clothes lent him by\nBarnett, transformed his appearance, and led Captain Parkinson to\ncongratulate himself that he had not obeyed his first impulse to send the\ncastaway forward with the men.\n\nThe officers pressed forward.\n\n\"Mighty glad to see you out.\" \"Hope you've got your pins under you\nagain.\" \"Old man, I'm mighty glad we came along.\"\n\nThe chorus of greeting was hearty enough, but the journalist barely paid\nthe courtesy of acknowledgment. His eye swept the horizon eagerly until\nit rested on the cloud of volcanic smoke billowing up across the setting\nsun. A sigh of relief escaped him.\n\n\"Where are we?\" he asked Barnett. \"I mean since you picked me up. How\nlong ago was that, anyway?\"\n\n\"Yesterday,\" replied the navigating officer. \"We've stood off and on,\nlooking for some of our men.\"\n\n\"Then that's the same volcano----\"\n\nBarnett laughed softly. \"Well, they aren't quite holding a caucus of\nvolcanoes down in this country. One like that is enough.\"\n\nBut Slade brushed the remark aside.\n\n\"Head for it!\" he cried excitedly. \"We may be in time! There's a man on\nthat island.\"\n\n\"A man!\" \"Another!\" \"Not Billy Edwards?\" \"Not some of our boys?\"\n\nSlade stared at them bewildered.\n\n\"Hold on,\" interposed Dr. Trendon authoritatively. \"What's his name?\" he\ninquired of the journalist.\n\n\"Darrow,\" replied the latter. \"Percy Darrow. Do you know him?\"\n\n\"Who in Kamschatka is Percy Darrow?\" demanded Forsythe.\n\n\"Why, he's the assistant.\" It's a long story----\"\n\n\"Of course, it's a long story. There's a lot we want to know,\"\ninterrupted Captain Parkinson. \"Quartermaster, head for the volcano\nyonder. Mr. Slade, we want to know where you came from; and why you left\nthe schooner, and who Percy Darrow is. And there's dinner, so we'll just\nadjourn to the messroom and hear what you can tell us. But there's one\nthing we're all anxious to know; how came you in the dory which we found\nand left on the _Laughing Lass_ no later than two days ago?\"\n\n\"I haven't set eyes on the _Laughing Lass_ for--well, I don't know\nhow long, but it's five days anyway, perhaps more,\" replied Slade.\n\nThey stared at him incredulously.\n\n\"Oh, I see!\" he burst out suddenly; \"there were twin dories on the\nschooner. The other one's still there, I suppose. Did you find her on the\nstern davits?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That's it, then. You see when I left----\"\n\nCaptain Parkinson's raised hand checked him. \"If you will be so good, Mr.\nSlade, let us have it all at once, after mess.\"\n\nAt table the young officers, at a sharp hint from Dr. Trendon, conversed\non indifferent subjects until the journalist had partaken heartily of\nwhat the physician allowed him. Slade ate with keen appreciation.\n\n\"I tell you, that's good,\" he sighed, when he had finished. \"Real, live,\nafter-dinner coffee, too. Why, gentlemen, I haven't eaten a civilised\nmeal, with all the trimmings, for over two years. Doctor, do you think a\nlittle of the real stuff would hurt me? It's a pretty dry yarning.\"\n\n\"One glass,\" growled the surgeon, \"no more.\"\n\n\"Scotch high-ball, then,\" voted Slade, \"the higher the better.\"\n\nThe steward brought a tall glass with ice, in which the newcomer mixed\nhis drink. Then for quite a minute he sat silent, staring at the table,\nhis fingers aimlessly rubbing into spots of wetness the water beads as\nthey gathered on the outside of his glass. Suddenly he looked up.\n\n\"I don't know how to begin,\" he confessed. \"It's too confounded\nimprobable. I hardly believe it myself, now that I'm sitting here in\nhuman clothes, surrounded by human beings. Old Scrubs, and the <DW65>,\nand Handy Solomon, and the Professor, and the chest, and the--well, they\nwere real enough when I was caught in the mess. But I warn you, you are\nnot going to believe me, and hanged if I blame you a bit.\"\n\n\"We've seen marvels ourselves in the last few days,\" encouraged Captain\nParkinson.\n\n\"Fire ahead, man,\" advised Barnett impatiently. \"Just begin at the\nbeginning and let it go at that.\"\n\nSlade sipped at his glass reflectively.\n\n\"Well,\" said he at length, \"the best way to begin is to show you how I\nhappened to be mixed up in it at all.\"\n\nThe officers unconsciously relaxed into attitudes of greater ease.\nOverhead the lamps swayed gently to the swell. The dull throb of the\nscrew pulsated. Stewards clad in white moved noiselessly, filling the\nglasses, deferentially striking lights for the smokers, clearing away the\nlast dishes of the repast.\n\n\"I'm a reporter by choice, and a detective by instinct,\" began Slade,\nwith startling abruptness. \"Furthermore, I'm pretty well off. I'm what\nthey call a free lance, for I have no regular desk on any of the\njournals. I generally turn my stuff in to the _Star_ because they\ntreat me well. In return it is pretty well understood between us that I'm\nto use my judgment in regard to 'stories' and that they'll stand back of\nme for expenses. You see, I've been with them quite a while.\"\n\nHe looked around the circle as though in appeal to the comprehension of\nhis audience. Some of the men nodded. Others sipped from their glasses or\ndrew at their cigars.\n\n\"I loaf around here and there in the world, having a good time\ntravelling, visiting, fooling around. Every once in a while something\ninterests me. The thing is a sort of instinct. I run it down. If it's a\ngood story, I send it in. That's all there is to it.\" He laughed\nslightly. \"You see, I'm a sort of magazine writer in method, but my stuff\nis newspaper stuff. Also the game suits me. That's why I play it. That's\nwhy I'm here. I have to tell you about myself this way so you will\nunderstand how I came to be mixed up in this _Laughing Lass_\nmatter.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" commented Barnett, \"that when you came aboard the _South\nDakota_, you had a little trouble making Captain Arnold see it.\" He\nturned to the others with a laugh. \"He had all kinds of papers of ancient\ndate, but nothing modern--letter from the _Star_ dated five years\nback, recommendations to everybody on earth, except Captain Arnold,\ncertificate of bravery in Apache campaign, bank identifications, and all\nthe rest. 'Maybe you're the _Star's_ correspondent, and maybe you're\nnot,' said the Captain, 'I don't see anything here to prove it.' Slade\nargued an hour; no go. Remember how you caught him?\" he inquired of\nSlade.\n\nThe reporter grinned assent.\n\n\"After the old man had turned him down for good, Slade fished down in his\nwarbag and hauled out an old tattered document from an oilskin case.\n'Hold on a minute,' said he, 'you old shellback. I've proved to you that\nI can write; and I've proved to you that I have fought, and now here I'll\nprove to you that I can sail. If writing, fighting, and sailing don't fit\nme adequately to report any little disturbances your antiquated\nwashboiler may blunder into, I'll go to raising cabbages.' With that he\npresented a master's certificate! Where did you get it, anyway? I never\nfound out.\"\n\n\"Passed as 'fresh-water' on the Great Lakes,\" replied Slade briefly.\n\n\"Well, the spunk and the certificate finished the captain. He was an old\nsquare rigger himself in the Civil War.\"\n\n\"So much for myself,\" Slade continued. \"As for the _Laughing\nLass_----\"\n\n\n\n\nPART TWO\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BRASS BOUND CHEST\n\n_Being the story told by Ralph Slade, Free Lance, to the officers of\nthe United States cruiser Wolverine_.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTHE BARBARY COAST\n\n\nA coincidence got me aboard her. I'll tell you how it was. One evening\nlate I was just coming out of a dark alley on the Barbary Coast, San\nFrancisco. You know--the water front, where you can hear more tongues\nthan at Port Said, see stranger sights, and meet adventure with the\njoyous certainty of mediaeval times. I'd been down there hunting up a man\nreported, by a wharf-rat of my acquaintance, to have just returned from a\ntwo years' whaling voyage. He'd been \"shanghaied\" aboard, and as a matter\nof fact, was worth nearly a million dollars. Landed in the city without a\ncent, could get nobody to believe him, nor trust him to the extent of a\ntelegram East. Wharf-rat laughed at his yarn; but I believe it was true.\nGood copy anyway----\n\nJust at the turn of the alley I nearly bumped into two men. On the\nBarbary Coast you don't pass men in narrow places until you have\nreconnoitered a little. I pulled up, thanking fortune that they had not\nseen me. The first words were uttered in a voice I knew well.\n\nYou've all heard of Dr. Karl Augustus Schermerhorn. He did some big\nthings, and had in mind still bigger. I'd met him some time before in\nconnection with his telepathy and wireless waves theory. It was\npicturesque stuff for my purpose, but wasn't in it with what the old\nfellow had really done. He showed me--well, that doesn't matter. The\npoint is, that good, staid, self-centred, or rather science-centred, Dr.\nSchermerhorn was standing at midnight in a dark alley on the Barbary\nCoast in San Francisco talking to an individual whose facial outline at\nleast was not ornamental.\n\nMy curiosity, or professional instinct, whichever you please, was all\naroused. I flattened myself against the wall.\n\nThe first remark I lost. The reply came to me in a shrill falsetto. So\ngrotesque was the effect of this treble from a bulk so squat and broad\nand hairy as the silhouette before me that I almost laughed aloud.\n\n\"I guess you've made no mistake on that. I'm her master, and her owner\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Well, I haf been told you might rent her,\" said the Doctor.\n\n\"Rent her!\" mimicked the falsetto. \"Well, that--hell, yes, I'll\n_rent_ her!\" he laughed again.\n\n\"Doch recht.\" The Doctor was plainly at the end of his practical\nresources.\n\nAfter waiting a moment for something more definite, the falsetto inquired\nrather drily:\n\n\"How long? What to? What for? Who are you, anyway?\"\n\n\"I am Dr. Schermerhorn,\" the latter answered.\n\n\"Seen pieces about you in the papers.\"\n\n\"How many men haf you in the crew?\"\n\n\"Me and the mate and the cook and four hands.\"\n\n\"And you could go--soon?\"\n\n\"Soon as you want--_if_ I go.\"\n\n\"I wish to leaf to-morrow.\"\n\n\"If I can get the crew together, I might make it. But say, let's not hang\nout here in this run of darkness. Come over to the grog shop yonder where\nwe can sit down.\"\n\nTo my relief, for my curiosity was fully aroused--Dr. Schermerhorn's\nmovements are usually productive--this proposal was vetoed.\n\n\"No, no!\" cried the Doctor, with some haste, \"this iss well! Somebody\nmight oferhear.\"\n\nThe huge figure stirred into an attitude of close attention. After a\npause the falsetto asked deliberately:\n\n\"Where we goin'?\"\n\n\"I brefer not to say.\"\n\n\"H'm! How long a cruise?\"\n\n\"I want to rent your schooner and your crew as-long-as I-please-to\nremain.\"\n\n\"H'm! How long's that likely to be?\"\n\n\"Maybe a few months; maybe seferal years.\"\n\n\"H'm! Unknown port; unknown cruise. See here, anything crooked in this?\"\n\n\"No, no! Not at all! It iss simply business of my own.\"\n\n\"Not that I care,\" commented the other easily, \"only risks is worth\npaying for.\"\n\n\"There shall not be risk.\"\n\n\"Pearls likely?\" hazarded the other, without much heed to the assurance.\n\"Them <DW61> gunboats is getting pretty hard to dodge of late years.\nHowever, I've dodged 'em before.\"\n\n\"Now as to pay--how mooch iss your boat worth?\"\n\nI could almost follow the man's thoughts as he pondered how much he dared\nask.\n\n\"Well, you see, for a proposition like that--don't know where we're\ngoing, when we're going to get back,--and them gunboats--how would a\nhundred and twenty-five a month strike you?\"\n\n\"Double it up. I want you to do ass I say, and I will also give your crew\ndouble wages. Bud I want goot men, who will stay, and who will keep the\nmouth shut.\"\n\n\"Gosh all fish-hooks! They'd go to hell with you for that!\"\n\n\"Now you can get all you want of Adams & Marsh. Tell them it iss for me,\nBrovisions for three years, anyhow. Be ready to sail to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Tide turns at eight in the evening.\"\n\n\"I will send some effects in the morning.\"\n\nThe master hesitated.\n\n\"That's all right, Doctor, but how do I know it's all right? Maybe by\nmorning you'll change your mind.\"\n\n\"That cannot be. My plans are all----\"\n\n\"It's the usual thing to pay something----\"\n\n\"Ach, but yes. I haf forgot. Darrow told me. I will make you a check. Let\nus go to the table of which you spoke.\"\n\nThey moved away, still talking. I did not dare follow them into the\nlight, for I feared that the Doctor would recognise me. I'd have given my\neye teeth, though, to have gathered the name of the schooner, or that of\nher master. As it was, I hung around until the two had emerged from the\ncorner saloon. They paused outside, still talking earnestly. I ventured a\nhasty interview with the bar-keeper.\n\n\"Did you notice the two men who were sitting at the middle table?\" I\nasked him.\n\n\"Sure!\" said he, shoving me my glass of beer.\n\n\"Know them?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Never laid eyes on 'em before. Old chap looked like a sort of corn\ndoctor or corner spell-binder. Other was probably one of these longshore\nabalone men.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I muttered, and dodged out again, leaving the beer untouched.\n\nI cursed myself for a blunderer. When I got to the street the two men had\ndisappeared. I should have shadowed the captain to his vessel.\n\nThe affair interested me greatly. Apparently Dr. Schermerhorn was about\nto go on a long voyage. I prided myself on being fairly up to date in\nregard to the plans of those who interested the public; and the public at\nthat time was vastly interested in Dr. Schermerhorn. I, in common with\nthe rest of the world, had imagined him anchored safely in Philadelphia,\nimmersed in chemical research. Here he bobbed up at the other end of the\ncontinent, making shady bargains with obscure shipping captains, and\npaying a big premium for absolute secrecy. It looked good.\n\nAccordingly I was out early the next morning. I had not much to go by;\nschooners are as plenty as tadpoles in San Francisco harbour. However, I\nwas sure I could easily recognise that falsetto voice; and I knew where\nthe supplies were to be purchased. Adams & Marsh are a large firm, and\ncautious. I knew better than to make direct inquiries, or to appear in\nthe salesroom. But by hanging around the door of the shipping room I soon\nhad track of the large orders to be sent that day. In this manner I had\nno great difficulty in following a truck to Pier 10, nor to identify a\nconsignment to Captain Ezra Selover as probably that of which I was in\nsearch.\n\nThe mate was in charge of the stowage, so I could not be quite sure.\nHere, however, was a schooner--of about a hundred and fifty tons burden.\nI looked her over.\n\nYou're all acquainted with the _Laughing Lass_ and the perfection of\nher lines. You have not known her under Captain Ezra Selover. She was the\ncleanest ship I ever saw. Don't know how he accomplished it, with a crew\nof four and the cook; but he did. The deck looked as though it had been\nholystoned every morning by a crew of jackies; the stays were whipped and\ntarred, the mast new-slushed, and every foot of running gear coiled down\nshipshape and Bristol fashion. There was a good deal of brass about her;\nit shone like gold, and I don't believe she owned an inch of paint that\nwasn't either fresh or new-scrubbed.\n\nI gazed for some time at this marvel. It's unusual enough anywhere, but\naboard a California hooker it is little short of miraculous. The crew had\nall turned up, apparently, and a swarm of stevedores were hustling every\nsort of provisions, supplies, stock, spars, lines and canvas down into\nthe hold. It was a rush job, and that mate was having his hands full. I\ndidn't wonder at his language nor at his looks, both of which were\nsomewhat mussed up. Then almost at my elbow I heard that shrill falsetto\nsqueal, and turned just in time to see the captain ascend the after\ngangplank.\n\nHe was probably the most dishevelled and untidy man I ever laid my eyes\non. His hair and beard were not only long, but tangled and unkempt, and\ngrew so far toward each other as barely to expose a strip of dirty brown\nskin. His shoulders were bowed and enormous. His arms hung like a\ngorilla's, palms turned slightly outwards. On his head was jammed a linen\nboating hat that had once been white; gaping away from his hairy chest\nwas a faded dingy checked cotton shirt that had once been brown and\nwhite; his blue trousers were spotted and splashed with dusty stains; he\nwas chewing tobacco. A figure more in contrast to the exquisitely neat\nvessel it would be hard to imagine.\n\nThe captain mounted the gangplank with a steadiness that disproved my\nfirst suspicion of his having been on a drunk. He glanced aloft, cast a\nspeculative eye on the stevedores trooping across the waist of the ship,\nand ascended to the quarter-deck where the mate stood leaning over the\nrail and uttering directed curses from between sweat-beaded lips. There\nthe big man roamed aimlessly on what seemed to be a tour of casual\ninspection. Once he stopped to breathe on the brass binnacle and to rub\nit bright with the dirtiest red bandana handkerchief I ever want to see.\n\nHis actions amused me. The discrepancy between his personal habits and\nhis particularity in the matter of his surroundings was exceedingly\ninteresting. I have often noticed that such discrepancies seem to\nindicate exceptional characters. As I watched him, his whole frame\nstiffened. The long gorilla arms contracted, the hairy head sunk forward\nin the tenseness of a serpent ready to strike. He uttered a shrill\nfalsetto shriek that brought to a standstill every stevedore on the job;\nand sprang forward to seize his mate by, the shoulder.\n\nEvidently the grasp hurt. I can believe it might, from those huge hands.\nThe man wrenched himself about with an oath of inquiry and pain. I could\nhear one side of what followed. The captain's high-pitched tones carried\nclearly; but the grumble and growl of the mate were indistinguishable at\nthat distance.\n\n\"How far is it to the side of the ship, you hound of hell?\" shrieked the\ncaptain.\n\nMumble--surprised--for an answer.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you, you _swab_! It's just two fathom from where\nyou stand. Just two fathom! How long would it take you to walk there? How\nlong? Just about six seconds! There and back! You--\" I won't bother with\nall the epithets, although by now I know Captain Selover's vocabulary\nfairly well. \"And you couldn't take six seconds off to spit over the\nside! Couldn't walk two fathom! Had to spit on my quarter-deck, did you!\"\n\nRumble from the mate.\n\n\"No, by God, you won't call up any of the crew. You'll get a swab and do\nit yourself. You'll get a _hand_ swab and get down on your knees,\ndamn you! I'll teach you to be lazy!\"\n\nThe mate said something again.\n\n\"It don't matter if we ain't under way. That has nothing to do with it.\nThe quarter-deck is clean, if the waist ain't, and nobody but a damn\nmisbegotten son-of-a-sea-lawyer would spit on deck anyhow!\" From this\nCaptain Selover went on into a good old-fashioned deep-sea \"cussing out,\"\nto the great joy of the stevedores.\n\nThe mate stood it pretty well, but there comes a time when further talk\nis useless even in regard to a most heinous offense. And, of course, as\nyou know, the mate could hardly consider himself very seriously at fault.\nWhy, the ship was not yet at sea, and in all the clutter of charging. He\nbegan to answer back. In a moment it was a quarrel. Abruptly it was a\nfight. The mate marked Selover beneath the left eye. The captain with\nbeautiful simplicity crushed his antagonist in his gorilla-like squeeze,\ncarried him to the side of the vessel, and dropped him limp and beaten to\nthe pier. And the mate was a good stout specimen of a sea-farer, too.\n\nThen the captain rushed below, emerging after an instant with a chest\nwhich he flung after his subordinate. It was followed a moment later by a\nstream of small stuff,--mingled with language--projected through an open\nport-hole. This in turn ceased. The captain reappeared with a pail and\nbrush, scrubbed feverishly at the offending spot, mopped it dry with that\nsame old red bandana handkerchief, glared about him,--and abruptly became\nas serene and placid as a noon calm. He took up the direction of the\nstevedores. It was all most astounding.\n\nNobody paid any attention to the mate. He looked toward the ship once or\ntwice, thought better of it, and began to pick up his effects, muttering\nsavagely. In a moment or so he threw his chest aboard an outgoing truck\nand departed.\n\nIt was now nearly noon and I was just in the way of going for something\nto eat, when I caught sight of another dray laden with boxes and crated\naffairs which I recognised as scientific apparatus. It was followed in\nquick succession by three others. Ignorant as I was of the requirements\nof a scientist, my common sense told me this could be no exploring\noutfit. I revised my first intention of going to the club, and bought a\nsandwich or two at the corner coffee house. I don't know why, but even\nthen the affair seemed big with mystery, with the portent of tragedy.\nPerhaps the smell of tar was in my nostrils and the sea called. It has\nalways possessed for me an extraordinary allurement----\n\nA little after two o'clock a cab drove to the after gangplank and\nstopped. From it alighted a young man of whom I shall later have occasion\nto tell you more, followed by Dr. Schermerhorn. The young man carried\nonly a light leather \"serviette,\" such as students use abroad; while the\ndoctor fairly staggered under the weight of a square, brass-bound chest\nwithout handles. The singularity of this unequal division of labour\nstruck me at once.\n\nIt struck also one of the dock men, who ran forward, eager for a tip.\n\n\"Kin I carry th' box for you, boss?\" he asked, at the same time reaching\nfor it.\n\nThe doctor's thin figure seemed fairly to shrink at the idea.\n\n\"No, no!\" he cried. \"It iss not for you to carry!\"\n\nHe hastened up the gangplank, clutching the chest close. At the top\nCaptain Selover met him.\n\n\"Hello, doctor,\" he squeaked. \"Here in good time. We're busy, you see.\nLet me carry your chest for you.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" Dr. Schermerhorn fairly glared.\n\n\"It's almighty heavy,\" insisted the captain. \"Let me give you a hand.\"\n\n\"You must not _touch!_\" emphatically ordered the scientist. \"Where\niss the cabin?\"\n\nHe disappeared down the companionway clasping his precious load. The\nyoung man remained on deck to superintend the stowing of the scientific\ngoods and the personal baggage.\n\nAll this time I had been thinking busily. I remembered distinctly one\nother instance when Dr. Schermerhorn had disappeared. He came back\ninscrutably, but within a week his results on aerial photography were\npublic property. I told myself that in the present instance his lavish\nuse of money, the elaborate nature of his preparations, the evident\nsecrecy of the expedition as evidenced by the fact that he had negotiated\nfor the vessel only the day before setting sail, the importance of\npersonal supervision as proved by the fact that he--notoriously\nimpractical in practical matters, and notoriously disliking anything to\ndo with business--had conducted the affair himself instead of delegating\nit,--why; gentlemen, don't you see that all this was more than enough to\nwake me up, body and soul? Suddenly I came to a definite resolution.\nCaptain Selover had descended to the pier. I approached him.\n\n\"You need a mate,\" said I.\n\nHe looked me over.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he admitted. \"Where's your man?\"\n\n\"Right here,\" said I.\n\nHis eyes widened a little. Otherwise he showed no sign of surprise. I\ncursed my clothes.\n\nFortunately I had my master's certificate with me--I'd passed\nfresh-water on the Great Lakes--I always carry that sort of document on\nthe chance that it may come handy. It chanced to have a couple of naval\nendorsements, results of the late war.\n\n\"Look here,\" I said before I gave it to him. \"You don't believe in me. My\nclothes are too good. That's all right. They're all I have that are good.\nI'm broke. I came down here wondering whether I'd better throw myself in\nthe drink.\"\n\n\"You look like a dude,\" he squeaked. \"Where did you ever ship?\"\n\nI handed him my certificate. The endorsements from Admiral Keays and\nCaptain Arnold impressed him. He stared at me again, and a gleam of\ncunning crept into his eyes.\n\n\"Nothing crooked about this?\" he breathed softly.\n\nI had the key to this side of his character. You remember I had overheard\nthe night before his statement of his moral scruples. I said nothing, but\nlooked knowing.\n\n\"What was it?\" he murmured. \"Plain desertion, or something worse?\"\n\nI remained inscrutable.\n\n\"Well,\" he conceded, \"I do need a mate; and a naval man--even if he is\nwantin' to get out of sight----\"\n\n\"He won't spit on your decks, anyway,\" I broke in boldly.\n\nCaptain Selover's hairy face bristled about the mouth. This I\nsubsequently discovered was symptom of a grin.\n\n\"You saw that, eh?\" he trebled.\n\n\"Aren't you afraid he'll bring down the police and delay your sailing?\" I\nasked.\n\nHe grinned again, with a cunning twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"You needn't worry. There ain't goin' to be any police. He had his\nadvance money, and he won't risk it by tryin' to come back.\"\n\nWe came to an agreement. I professed surprise at the wages. The captain\nguardedly explained that the expedition was secret.\n\n\"What's our port?\" I asked, to test him.\n\n\"Our papers are made out for Honolulu,\" he replied.\n\nWe adjourned to sign articles.\n\n\"By the way,\" said I, \"I wish you wouldn't make them out in my own name.\n'Eagen' will do.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he laughed, \"I _sabe_. Eagen it is.\"\n\n\"I'll be aboard at six,\" said I. \"I've got to make some arrangements.\"\n\n\"Wish you could help with the lading,\" said he. \"Still, I can get along.\nWant any advance money?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied; then I remembered that I was supposed to be broke.\n\"Yes,\" I amended.\n\nHe gave me ten dollars.\n\n\"I guess you'll show up,\" he said. \"Wouldn't do this to everybody. But a\nnaval man--even if he is dodgin' Uncle Sam----\"\n\n\"I'll be here,\" I assured him.\n\nAt that time I wore a pointed beard. This I shaved. Also I was accustomed\nto use eye-glasses. The trouble was merely a slight astigmatism which\nbothered me only in reading or close inspection. I could get along\nperfectly well without the glasses, so I discarded them. I had my hair\ncut rather close. When I had put on sea boots, blue trousers and shirt, a\npea jacket and a cap I felt quite safe from the recognition of a man like\nDr. Schermerhorn. In fact, as you shall see, I hardly spoke to him during\nall the voyage out.\n\nPromptly at six, then, I returned with a sea chest, bound I knew not\nwhither, to be gone I knew not for how long, and pledged to act as second\nofficer on a little hundred-and-fifty-ton schooner.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE GRAVEN IMAGE\n\n\nI had every reason to be satisfied with my disguise,--if such it could\nbe called. Captain Selover at first failed to recognise me. Then he burst\ninto his shrill cackle.\n\n\"Didn't know you,\" he trebled. \"But you look shipshape. Come, I'll show\nyou your quarters.\"\n\nImmediately I discovered what I had suspected before; that on so small a\nschooner the mate took rank with the men rather than the afterguard.\nCabin accommodations were of course very limited. My own lurked in the\nwaist of the ship--a tiny little airless hole.\n\n\"Here's where Johnson stayed,\" proffered Selover. \"You can bunk here, or\nyou can go in the foc'sle with the men. They's more room there. We'll get\nunder way with the turn of the tide.\"\n\nHe left me. I examined the cabin. It was just a trifle larger than its\nsingle berth, and the berth was just a trifle larger than myself. My\nchest would have to be left outside. I strongly suspected that my lungs\nwould have to be left outside also; for the life of me I could not see\nwhere the air was to come from. With a mental reservation in favour of\ninvestigating the forecastle, I went on deck.\n\nThe _Laughing Lass_ was one of the prettiest little schooners I ever\nsaw. Were it not for the lines of her bilges and the internal arrangement\nof her hold, it might be imagined she had been built originally as a\npleasure yacht. Even the rake of her masts, a little forward of the\nplumb, bore out this impression, which a comparatively new suit of\ncanvas, well stopped down, brass stanchions forward, and two little guns\nunder tarpaulins, almost confirmed. One thing struck me as peculiar. Her\ncomplement of boats was ample enough. She had two surf boats, a dingy,\nand a dory slung to the davits. In addition another dory,--the one you\npicked me up in--was lashed to the top of the deck house.\n\n\"They'd mighty near have a boat apiece,\" I thought, and went forward.\n\nJust outside the forecastle hatch I paused. Someone below was singing in\na voice singularly rich in quality. The words and the quaintness of the\nminor air struck me immensely and have clung to my memory like a burr\never since.\n\n  \"'Are you a man-o'-war or a privateer,' said he.\n    _Blow high, blow low, what care we!_\n  'Oh, I am a jolly pirate, and I'm sailing for my fee.'\n    _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e.\"_\n\nI stepped to the companion. The voice at once ceased. I descended.\n\nA glimmer of late afternoon struggled through the deadlights. I found\nmyself in a really commodious space,--extending far back of where the\nforward bulk-heads are usually placed,--accommodating rows and row of\nbunks--eighteen of them, in fact. The unlighted lamp cast its shadow on\nwood stained black by much use, but polished like ebony from the\ncontinued friction of men's garments. I wish I could convey to you the\nuncanny effect, this--of dropping from the decks of a miniature craft to\nthe internal arrangements of a square-rigged ship. It was as though,\nentering a cottage door, you were to discover yourself on the floor of\nMadison Square Garden. A fresh sweet breeze of evening sucked down the\nhatch. I immediately decided on the forecastle. Already it was being\nborne in on me that I was little more than a glorified bo's'n's mate. The\nsituation suited me, however. It enabled me to watch the course of events\nmore safely, less exposed to the danger of recognition.\n\nI stood for a moment at the foot of the companion accustoming my eyes to\nthe gloom. After a moment, with a shock of surprise, I made out a shining\npair of bead-points gazing at me unblinkingly from the shadow under the\nbitts. Slowly the man defined himself, as a shape takes form in a fog. He\nwas leaning forward in an attitude of attention, his elbows resting on\nhis knees, his forearms depending between them, his head thrust out. I\ncould detect no faintest movement of eyelash, no faintest sound of\nbreathing. The stillness was portentous. The creature was exactly like a\nwax figure, one of the sort you meet in corridors of cheap museums and\nfor a moment mistake for living beings. Almost I thought to make out the\ncustomary grey dust lying on the wax of his features.\n\nI am going to tell you more of this man, because, as you shall see, he\nwas destined to have much to do with my life, the fate of Dr. Karl\nAugustus Schermerhorn, and the doom of the _Laughing Lass_.\n\nHe wore on his head a red bandana handkerchief. I never saw him with\nother covering. From beneath It straggled oily and tangled locks of\nglossy black. His face was long, narrow, hook-nosed and sinister; his\neyes, as I have described them, a steady and beady black. I could at\nfirst glance ascribe great activity, but only moderate strength to his\nslender, wiry figure. In this I was mistaken. His sheer physical power\nwas second only to that of Captain Selover. One of his forearms ended in\na steel hook. At the moment I could not understand this; could not see\nhow a man so maimed could be useful aboard a ship. Later I wished we had\nmore as handy. He knew a jam hitch which he caught over and under his\nhook quicker than most men can grasp a line with the naked hand. It would\nrender one way, but held fast the other. He told me it was a cinch-hook\nhitch employed by mule packers in the mountains, and that he had used it\non swamp-hooks in the lumber woods of Michigan. I shouldn't wonder. He\nwas a Wandering Jew.--His name was Anderson, but I never heard him called\nthat. It was always \"Handy Solomon\" with men and masters.\n\nWe stared at each other, I fascinated by something, some spell of the\nship, which I have never been able to explain to myself--nor even\ndescribe. It was a mystery, a portent, a premonition such as overtakes a\nman sometimes in the dark passageways of life. I cannot tell you of it,\nnor make you believe--let it pass----\n\nThen by a slow process of successive perceptions I became aware that I\nwas watched by other eyes, other wax figures, other human beings with\nunwavering gaze. They seemed to the sense of mystic apprehension that for\nthe moment held possession of me, to be everywhere--in the bunks, on the\nfloor, back in the shadows, watching, watching, watching from the\nadvantage of another world.\n\n[Illustration: Slowly the man defined himself as a shape takes form in a\nfog.]\n\nI don't know why I tell you this; why I lay so much stress on the first\nweird impression I got of the forecastle. It means something to me\nnow--in view of all that happened subsequently. Almost can I look back\nand see, in that moment of occultism, a warning, an enlightenment----But\nthe point is, it meant something to me then. I stood there fascinated,\nunable to move, unable to speak.\n\nThen the grotesque figure in the corner stirred.\n\n\"Well, mates,\" said the man, \"believe or not believe, it's in the book,\nand it stands to reason, too. We have gold mines here in Californy and\nNevada and all them States; and we hear of gold mines in Mexico and\nAustralia, too, but did you ever hear tell of gold mines in Europe? Tell\nme that! And where did the gold come from then, before they discovered\nAmerica? Tell me that! Why they made it, just as the man that wrote\nthis-here says, and you can kiss the Book on that.\"\n\n\"How about that place, Ophir, I read about?\" asked a voice from the\nbunks.\n\nThe man shot a keen glance thither from beneath his brows.\n\n\"Know last year's output from the mines of Ophir, Thrackles?\" he inquired\nin silky tones.\n\n\"Why, no,\" stammered the man addressed as Thrackles.\n\n\"Well I do,\" pursued the man with the steel hook, \"and it's just the\nwhole of nothing, and you can kiss the Book on that too! There ain't any\ngold output, because there ain't any mines, and there never have been.\nThey made their gold.\"\n\nHe tossed aside a book he had been holding in his left hand. I recognised\nthe fat little paper duodecimo with amusement, and some wonder. The only\nother copy I had ever laid my eyes on is in the Astor Library. It is\nsomewhat of a rarity, called _The Secret of Alchemy, or the Grand\nDoctrine of Transmutation Fully Explained_, and was written by a Dr.\nEdward Duvall,--a most extraordinary volume to have fallen into the hands\nof seamen.\n\nI stepped forward, greeting and being greeted. Besides the man I have\nmentioned they were four. The cook was a bullet-headed squat <DW64> with a\nbroken nose. I believe he had a name,--Robinson, or something of that\nsort. He was to all of us, simply the <DW65>. Unlike most of his race, he\nwas gloomy and taciturn.\n\nOf the other two, a little white-faced, thin-chested youth named Pulz,\nand a villainous-looking Mexican called Perdosa, I shall have more to say\nlater.\n\nMy arrival broke the talk on alchemy. It resumed its course in the\ndirection of our voyage. Each discovered that the others knew nothing;\nand each blundered against the astounding fact of double wages.\n\n\"All I know is the pay's good; and that's enough,\" concluded Thrackles,\nfrom a bunk.\n\n\"The pay's too good,\" growled Handy Solomon.\n\n\"This ain't no job to go look at the 'clipse of the moon, or the devil's\na preacher!\"\n\n\"W'at you maik heem, den?\" queried Perdosa.\n\n\"It's treasure, of course,\" said Handy Solomon shortly.\n\n\"He, he, he!\" laughed the <DW64>, without mirth.\n\n\"What's the matter with you, Doctor?\" demanded Thrackles.\n\n\"Treasure!\" repeated the <DW65>. \"You see dat box he done carry so\ncairful? You see dat?\"\n\nA pause ensued. Somebody scratched a match and lit a pipe.\n\n\"No, I don't see that!\" broke out Thrackles finally, with some\nimpatience. \"I _sabe_ how a man goes after treasure with a box; but\nwhy should he take treasure away in a box? What do you think, Bucko?\" he\nsuddenly appealed to me.\n\nI looked up from my investigation of the empty berths.\n\n\"I don't think much about it,\" I replied, \"except that by the look of the\nstores we're due for more than Honolulu; and from the look of the light\nwe'd better turn to on deck.\"\n\nAn embarrassed pause fell.\n\n\"Who are you, anyway?\" bluntly demanded the man with the steel hook.\n\n\"My name is Eagen,\" I replied; \"I've the berth of mate. Which of these\nbunks are empty?\"\n\nThey indicated what I desired with just a trace of sullenness. I\nunderstood well enough their resentment at having a ship's officer\nquartered on them,--the forec'stle they considered as their only liberty\nwhen at sea, and my presence as a curtailment to the freedom of speech. I\nsubsequently did my best to overcome this feeling, but never quite\nsucceeded.\n\nAt my command the <DW65> went to his galley, I ascended to the deck. Dusk\nwas falling, in the swift Californian fashion. Already the outlines of\nthe wharf houses were growing indistinct, and the lights of the city were\nbeginning to twinkle. Captain Selover came to my side and leaned over the\nrail, peering critically at the black water against the piles.\n\n\"She's at the flood,\" he squeaked. \"And here comes the Lucy Belle.\"\n\nThe tug took us in charge and puffed with us down the harbour and through\nthe Golden Gate. We had sweated the canvas on her, even to the flying jib\nand a huge club topsail she sometimes carried at the main, for the\nafternoon trades had lost their strength. About midnight we drew up on\nthe Farallones.\n\nThe schooner handled well. Our crew was divided into three watches--an\nunusual arrangement, but comfortable. Two men could sail her handily in\nmost sorts of weather. Handy Solomon had the wheel. Otherwise the deck\nwas empty. The man's fantastic headgear, the fringe of his curling oily\nlocks, the hawk outline of his face momentarily silhouetted against the\nphosphorescence astern as he glanced to windward, all lent him an\nappearance of another day. I could almost imagine I caught the gleam of\nsilver-butted horse pistols and cutlasses at his waist.\n\nI brooded in wonder at what I had seen and how little I had explained.\nThe number of boats, sufficient for a craft of three times the tonnage;\nthe capacity of the forec'stle with its eighteen bunks, enough for a\npassenger ship,--what did it mean? And this wild, unkempt, villainous\ncrew with its master and his almost ridiculous contrast of neatness and\nfilth;--did Dr. Schermerhorn realise to what he had trusted himself and\nhis precious expedition, whatever it might be?\n\nThe lights of shore had sunk; the _Laughing Lass_ staggered and\nleaped joyously with the glory of the open sea. She seemed alone on the\nbosom of the ocean; and for the life of me I could not but feel that I\nwas embarked on some desperate adventure. The notion was utterly\nillogical; that I knew well. In sober thought, I, a reporter, was\nshadowing a respectable and venerable scientist, who in turn was probably\nabout to investigate at length some little-known deep-sea conditions or\nphenomena of an unexplored island. But that did not suffice to my\nimagination. The ship, its surroundings, its equipment, its crew--all\nread fantastic. So much the better story, I thought, shrugging my\nshoulders at last.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE TWELVE REPEATING RIFLES\n\n\nAfter my watch below the next morning I met Percy Darrow. In many ways he\nis, or was, the most extraordinary of my many acquaintances. During that\nfirst half hour's chat with him I changed my mind at least a dozen times.\nOne moment I thought him clever, the next an utter ass; now I found him\nfrank, open, a good companion, eager to please,--and then a droop of his\nblond eyelashes, a lazy, impertinent drawl of his voice, a hint of\nhalf-bored condescension in his manner, convinced me that he was shy and\naffected. In a breath I appraised him as intellectual, a fool, a shallow\nmind, a deep schemer, an idler, and an enthusiast. One result of his\nspasmodic confidences was to throw a doubt upon their accuracy. This\nmight be what he desired; or with equal probability it might be the\nchance reflection of a childish and aimless amiability.\n\nHe was tall and slender and pale, languid of movement, languid of eye,\nlanguid of speech. His eyes drooped, half-closed beneath blond brows; a\nlong wiry hand lazily twisted a rather affected blond moustache, his\nvoice drawled his speech in a manner either insufferably condescending\nand impertinent, or ineffably tired,--who could tell which?\n\nI found him leaning against the taffrail, his languid graceful figure\nsupported by his elbows, his chin propped against his hand. As I\napproached the binnacle, he raised his eyes and motioned me to him. The\ninsolence of it was so superb that for a moment I was angry enough to\nignore him. Then I reflected that I was here, not to stand on my personal\ndignity, but to get information. I joined him.\n\n\"You are the mate?\" he drawled.\n\n\"Since I am on the quarter-deck,\" I snapped back at him.\n\nHe eyed me thoughtfully, while he rolled with one hand a corn-husk\nMexican cigarette.\n\n\"Do you know where you are going?\" he inquired at length.\n\n\"Depends on the moral character of my future actions,\" I rejoined tartly.\n\nHe allowed a smile to break and fade, then lighted his cigarette.\n\n\"The first mate seems to have a remarkable command of language,\" said he.\n\nI did not reply.\n\n\"Well, to tell you the truth I don't know where we are going,\" he\ncontinued. \"Thought you might be able to inform me. Where did this ship\nand its precious gang of cutthroats come from, anyway?\"\n\n\"Meaning me?\"\n\n\"Oh, meaning you too, for all I know,\" he shrugged wearily. Suddenly he\nturned to me and laid his hand on my shoulder with one of those sudden\nbursts of confidence I came later to recognise and look for, but in which\nI could never quite believe--nor disbelieve.\n\n\"I am eaten with curiosity,\" he stated in the least curious voice in the\nworld. \"I suppose you know who his Nibs is?\"\n\n\"Dr. Schermerhorn, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes. Well, I've been with him ten years. I am his right-hand man. All\nhis business I transact down to the last penny. I even order his meals.\nHis discoveries have taken shape in my hands. Suddenly he gets a freak.\nHe will go on a voyage. Where? I shall know in good time. For how long? I\nshall know in good time. For what purpose? Same answer. What\naccommodations shall I engage? I experience the worst shock of my\nlife;--he will engage them himself. What scientific apparatus? Shock\nnumber two;--he will attend to that. Is there anything I can do? What do\nyou suppose he says?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" I asked.\n\n\"You should know in the course of intelligent conversation with me,\" he\ndrawled. \"Well, he, good old staid Schermie with the vertebrated thoughts\ngets kittenish. He says to me, 'Joost imachin, Percy, you are\nall-alone-on-a-desert-island placed; and that you will sit on those sands\nand wish within yourself all you would buy to be comfortable. Go out and\nbuy me those things--in abundance.' Those were my directions.\"\n\nHe puffed.\n\n\"What does he pay you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Enough,\" I replied.\n\n\"More than enough, by a good deal, I'll bet,\" he rejoined. \"The old fool!\nHe ought to have left it to me. What is this craft? Have you ever sailed\non her before?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Have any of the crew?\"\n\nI replied that I believed all of them were Selover's men. He threw the\ncigarette butt into the sea and turned back.\n\n\"Well, I wish you joy of your double wages,\" he mocked.\n\nSo he knew that, after all! How much more of his ignorance was pretended\nI had no means of guessing. His eye gleamed sarcastically as he sauntered\ntoward the companion-way. Handy Solomon was at the wheel, steering easily\nwith one foot and an elbow. His steel hook lay fully exposed, glittering\nin the sunlight. Darrow glanced at it curiously, and at the man's\nheadgear.\n\n\"Well, my genial pirate,\" he drawled, \"if you had a line to fit that\nhook, you'd be equipped for fishing.\" The man's teeth bared like an\nanimal's, but Darrow went on easily as though unconscious of giving\noffence. \"If I were you, I'd have it arranged so the hook would turn\nbackward as well as forward. It would be handier for some\nthings,--fighting, for instance.\"\n\nHe passed on down the companion. Handy Solomon glared after him, then\ndown at his hook. He bent his arm this way and that, drawing the hook\ntoward him softly, as a cat does her claws. His eyes cleared and a look\nof admiration crept into them.\n\n\"By God, he's right!\" he muttered, and after a moment; \"I've wore that\nten year and never thought of it. The little son of a gun!\"\n\nHe remained staring for a moment at the hook. Then he looked up and\ncaught my eye. His own turned quizzical. He shifted his quid and began to\nhum:\n\n  \"The bos'n laid aloft, aloft laid he,\n    _Blow high, blow low! What care we?_\n  'There's a ship upon the wind'ard, a wreck upon the lee,'\n    _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e.\"_\n\nWe had entered the trades and were making good time. I was content to\nstay on deck, even in my watch below. The wind was strong, the waves\ndashing, the sky very blue. From under our forefoot the flying fish sped,\nthe monsters pursued them. A tingle of spray was in the air. It was all\nvery pleasant. The red handkerchief around Solomon's head made a pretty\nspot of colour against the blue of the sky and the darker blue of the\nsea. Silhouetted over the flaw-less white of the deck house was the\nsullen, polished profile of the <DW65>. Beneath me the ship swerved\nand leaped, yielded and recovered. I breathed deep, and saw cutlasses in\nharmless shadows. It was two years ago. I was young--then----\n\nAt the mess hour I stood in doubt. However, I was informed by the\ncaptain's falsetto that I was to eat in the cabin. As the only other\nofficer, I ate alone, after the others had finished, helping myself from\nthe dishes left on the table. It was a handsome cabin, well kept, with\nwhite woodwork spotlessly clean, leather cushions--much better than one\nwould expect. I afterwards found that the neatness of this cabin and of\nthe three staterooms was maintained by the <DW65>--at peril of his neck.\nA rack held a dozen rifles, five revolvers, and,--at last--my cutlasses.\nI examined the lot with interest. They were modern weapons,--the new high\npower 30-40 box-magazine rifle, shooting government ammunition,--and had\nbeen used. The revolvers were of course the old 45 Colt's. This was an\nextraordinary armament for a peaceable schooner of one hundred and fifty\ntons burden.\n\nThe rest of the cabin's fittings were not remarkable. By the\nconfiguration of the ship I guessed that two of the staterooms must be\nrather large. I could make out voices within.\n\nOn deck I talked with Captain Selover.\n\n\"She's a snug craft,\" I approached him.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"You have armed her well.\"\n\nHe muttered something of pirates and the China seas.\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"You have arms enough to give your crew about two magazine rifles\napiece--unless you filled all your berths forward!\"\n\nCaptain Selover looked me direct in the eye.\n\n\"Talk straight, Mr. Eagen,\" said he.\n\n\"What is this ship, and where is she bound?\" I asked, with equal\nsimplicity.\n\nHe considered.\n\n\"As for the ship,\" he replied at length, \"I don't mind saying. You're my\nfirst officer, and on you I depend if it comes to--well, the small arms\nbelow. If the ship's a little under the shade, why, so are you. She's by\nway of being called a manner of hard names by some people. I do not see\nit myself. It is a matter of conscience. If you would ask some\ninterested, they would call her a smuggler, a thief, a wrecker, and all\nthe other evil titles in the catalogue. She has taken in Chinks by way of\nSanta Cruz Island--if that is smuggling. The country is free, and a Chink\nis a man. Besides, it paid ten dollars a head for the landing. She has\ncarried in a cargo or so of junk; it was lying on the beach where a fool\nmaster had piled it, and I took what I found. I couldn't keep track of\nthe underwriters' intentions.\"\n\n\"But the room forward----?\" I broke in.\n\n\"Well, you see, last season we were pearl fishing.\"\n\n\"But you needed only your diver and your crew,\" I objected.\n\n\"There was the matter of a Japanese gunboat or so,\" he explained.\n\n\"Poaching!\" I cried.\n\n\"So some call it. The shells are there. The islands are not inhabited. I\ndo not see how men claim property beyond the tide water. I have heard it\nargued----\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" I cried. \"There was a trouble last year in the Ishigaki Jima\nIslands where a poacher beat off the _Oyama_. It was a desperate\nfight.\"\n\nCaptain Selover's eye lit up.\n\n\"I've commanded a black brigantine, name of _The Petrel_,\" he\nadmitted simply. \"She was a brigantine aloft, but _alow_ she had\nmuch the same lines as the _Laughing Lass_.\" He whirled on his heel\nto roll to one of the covered yacht's cannon. \"Looks like a harmless\nlittle toy to burn black powder, don't she?\" he remarked. He stripped off\nthe tarpaulin and the false brass muzzle to display as pretty a little\nMaxim as you would care to see. \"Now you know all about it,\" he said.\n\n\"Look here, Captain Selover,\" I demanded, \"don't you know that I could\nblow your whole shooting-match higher than Gilderoy's kite. How do you\nknow I won't do it when I get back? How do you know I won't inform the\ndoctor at once what kind of an outfit he has tied to?\"\n\nHe planted far apart his thick legs in their soiled blue trousers, pushed\nback his greasy linen boating hat and stared at me with some amusement.\n\n\"How do you know I won't blow on Lieutenant or Ensign Ralph Slade,\nU.S.N., when I get back?\" he demanded. I blessed that illusion, anyway.\n\"Besides, I know my man. You won't do anything of the sort.\" He walked to\nthe rail and spat carefully over the side.\n\n\"As for the doctor,\" he went on, \"he knows all about it. He told me all\nabout myself, and everything I had ever done from the time I'd licked\nBuck Jones until last season's little diversion. Then he told me that was\nwhy he wanted me to ship for this cruise.\" The captain eyed me\nquizzically.\n\nI threw out my hands in a comic gesture of surrender.\n\n\"Well, where are we bound, anyway?\"\n\nThe dirty, unkempt, dishevelled figure stiffened.\n\n\"Mr. Eagen,\" its falsetto shrilled, \"you are mate of this vessel. Your\nduty is to see that my orders as to sailing are carried out. Beyond that\nyou do not go. As to navigation, and latitude and longitude and where the\nhell we are, that is outside your line of duty. As to where we are bound,\nyou are getting double wages not to get too damn curious. Remember to\nearn your wages, Mr. Eagen!\"\n\nHe turned away to the binnacle. In spite of his personal filth, in spite\nof the lawless, almost piratical, character of the man, in that moment I\ncould not but admire him. If Percy Darrow was ignorant of the purposes of\nthis expedition, how much more so Captain Selover. Yet he accepted his\ntrust blindly, and as far as I could then see, intended to fulfil it\nfaithfully. I liked him none the worse for snubbing me. It indicated a\nstreak in his moral nature akin to and quite as curious as his excessive\nneatness regarding his immediate surroundings.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE STEEL CLAW\n\n\nDuring the next few days the crew discussed our destination. Discipline,\nwhile maintained strictly, was not conventional. During the dog watches,\noften, every man aboard would be below, for at that period Captain\nSelover loved to take the wheel in person, a thick cigar between his\nlips, the dingy checked shirt wide open to expose his hairy chest to the\nbreeze. In the twilight of the forecastle we had some great sea-lawyer's\ntalks--I say \"We,\" though I took little part in them. Generally I lay\nacross my bunk smoking my pipe while Handy Solomon held forth, his speech\npunctuated by surly speculations from the <DW65>, with hesitating\ndeep-sea wisdom from the hairy Thrackles, or with voluminous bursts of\nfractured English from Perdosa. Pulz had nothing to offer, but watched\nfrom his pale green eyes. The light shifted and wavered from one to the\nother as the ship swayed: garments swung; the empty berths yawned\ncavernous. I could imagine the forecastle filled with the desperate men\nwho had beaten off the _Oyama_. The story is told that they had\nswept the gunboat's decks with her own rapid-fires, turned in.\n\nNo one knew where we were going, nor why. The doctor puzzled them, and\nthe quantity of his belongings.\n\n\"It ain't pearls,\" said Handy Solomon. \"You can kiss the Book on that,\nfor we ain't a diver among us. It ain't Chinks, for we are cruising\nsou'-sou'-west. Likely it's trade,--trade down in the Islands.\"\n\nWe were all below. The captain himself had the wheel. Discipline, while\nstrict, was not conventional.\n\n\"Contrabandista,\" muttered the Mexican, \"for dat he geev us double pay.\"\n\n\"We don't get her for nothing,\" agreed Thrackles. \"Double pay and duff on\nWednesday generally means get your head broke.\"\n\n\"No trade,\" said the <DW65> gloomily.\n\nThey turned to him with one accord.\n\n\"Why not?\" demanded Pulz, breaking his silence.\n\n\"No trade,\" repeated the <DW65>.\n\n\"Ain't you got a reason, Doctor?\" asked Handy Solomon.\n\n\"No trade,\" insisted the <DW65>.\n\nAn uneasy silence fell. I could not but observe that the others held the\n<DW65>'s statements in a respect not due them as mere opinions.\nSubsequently I understood a little more of the reputation he possessed.\nHe was believed to see things hidden, as their phrase went.\n\nNobody said anything for some time; nobody stirred, except that Handy\nSolomon, his steel claw removed from its socket, whittled and tested,\nscrewed and turned, trying to fix the hook so that, in accordance with\nthe advice of Percy Darrow, it would turn either way.\n\n\"What is it, then, Doctor?\" he asked softly at last.\n\n\"Gold,\" said the <DW65> shortly. \"Gold--treasure.\"\n\n\"That's what I said at first!\" cried Handy Solomon triumphantly. It was\nextraordinary, the unquestioning and entire faith with which they\naccepted as gospel fact the <DW64>'s dictum.\n\nThere followed much talk of the nature of this treasure, whether it was\nto be sought or conveyed, bought, stolen, or ravished in fair fight. No\nfurther soothsaying could they elicit from the <DW65>. They followed\ntheir own ideas, which led them nowhere. Someone lit the forecastle lamp.\nThey settled themselves. Pulz read aloud.\n\nThis was the programme every day during the dog watch. Sometimes the\nwatch on deck was absent, leaving only Handy Solomon, the <DW65> and\nPulz, but the order of the day was not on that account varied. They\ntalked, they lit the lamp, they read. Always the talk was of the\ntreasure.\n\nAs to the reading, it was of the sort usual to seamen, cowboys,\nlumbermen, and miners. Thrackles had a number of volumes of very cheap\nlove stories. Pulz had brought some extraordinary garish detective\nstories. The others contributed sensational literature with paper covers\nadorned lithographically. By the usual incongruity a fragment of _The\nMarble Faun_ was included in the collection. The <DW65> has his copy\nof _Duvall on Alchemy_. I haven't the slightest idea where he could\nhave got it.\n\nWhile Pulz read, Handy Solomon worked on the alteration of his claw. He\ncould never get it to hold, and I remember as an undertone to Pulz's\nreading, the rumble of strange, exasperated oaths. Whatever the evening's\nlecture, it always ended with the book on alchemy. These men had no\nperspective by which to judge such things. They accepted its speculations\nand theories at their face value. Extremely laughable were the\ndiscussions that followed. I often wished the shade of old Duvall could\nbe permitted to see these, his last disciples, spelling out dimly his\nteachings, mispronouncing his grave utterances, but believing utterly.\n\nDr. Schermerhorn appeared on deck seldom. When he did, often his fingers\nheld a pen which he had forgotten to lay aside. I imagined him\npreoccupied by some calculation of his own, but the forecastle, more\npicturesquely, saw him as guarding constantly the heavy casket he had\nhimself carried aboard. He breathed the air, walked briskly, turned with\nthe German military precision at the end of his score of strides, and\nre-entered his cabin at the lapse of the half hour. After he had gone,\nremained Percy Darrow leaning indolently against the taffrail, his\ngraceful figure swaying with the ship's motion, smoking always the\ncorn-husk Mexican cigarettes which he rolled with one hand. He seemed\nfrom that farthest point aft to hold in review the appliances, the\nfabric, the actions, yes, even the very thoughts, of the entire ship.\nFrom them he selected that on which he should comment or with which he\nshould play, always with a sardonic, half-serious, quite wearied and\nindifferent manner. His inner knowledge, viewed by the light of this\nmanner or mannerism, was sometimes uncanny, though perhaps the sources of\nhis information were commonplace enough, after all. Certainly he always\nviewed with amusement his victim's wonder.\n\nThus one evening at the close of our day-watch on deck, he approached\nHandy Solomon. It was at the end of ten days, on no one of which had the\nseaman failed to tinker away at his steel claw. Darrow balanced in front\nof him with a thin smile.\n\n\"Too bad it doesn't work, my amiable pirate,\" said he. \"It would be so\nhandy for fighting--See here,\" he suddenly continued, pulling some object\nfrom his pocket, \"here's a pipe; present to me; I don't smoke 'em. Twist\nher halfway, like that, she comes out. Twist her halfway, like this, she\ngoes in. That's your principle. Give her back to me when you get\nthrough.\"\n\nHe thrust the briar pipe into the man's hand, and turned away without\nwaiting for a reply. The seaman looked after him in open amazement. That\nevening he worked on the socket of the steel hook, and in two days he had\nthe job finished. Then he returned the pipe to Darrow with some growling\nof thanks.\n\n\"That's all right,\" said the young man, smiling full at him. \"Now what\nare you going to fight?\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE\n\n\nCaptain Selover received as his due the most absolute and implicit\nobedience imaginable. When he condescended to give an order in his\nown person, the men fairly jumped to execute it. The matter had evidently\nbeen threshed out long ago. They did not love him, not they; but they\nfeared him with a mighty fear, and did not hesitate to say so,\nvividly, and often, when in the privacy of the forecastle. The\nprevailing spirit was that of the wild beast, cowed but snarling\nstill. Pulz and Thrackles in especial had a great deal to say of what\nthey were or were not going to do, but I noticed that their resolution\nalways began to run out of them when first foot was set to the\ncompanion ladder.\n\nOne day we were loafing along, everything drawing well, and everybody\nbut the doctor on deck to enjoy the sun. I was in the crow's-nest for\nmy pleasure. Below me on the deck Captain Selover roamed here and\nthere, as was his custom, his eye cocked out like a housewife's for\ndisorder. He found it, again in the evidence of expectoration, and\nas Perdosa happened to be handiest, fell on the unfortunate Mexican.\n\nPerdosa protested that he had had nothing to do with it, but Captain\nSelover, enraged as always when his precious deck was soiled, would\nnot listen. Finally the Mexican grew sulky and turned away as though\nrefusing to hear more. The captain thereupon felled him to the deck,\nand began brutally to kick him in the face and head.\n\nPerdosa writhed and begged, but without avail. The other members of\nthe crew gathered near. After a moment, they began to murmur. Finally\nThrackles ventured, most respectfully, to intervene.\n\n\"You'll kill him, sir,\" he interposed. \"He's had enough.\"\n\n\"Had enough, has he?\" screeched the captain. \"Well, you take what's\nleft.\"\n\nHe marked Thrackles heavily over the eye. There was a breathless\npause; and then Thrackles, Pulz, the <DW65>, and Perdosa attacked at\nonce.\n\nThey caught the master unawares, and bore him to the deck. I dropped\nat once to the ratlines, and commenced my descent. Before I had\nreached the deck, however, Selover was afoot again, the four hanging\nto him like dogs. In a moment more he had shaken them off; and before\nI could intervene, he had seized a belaying pin in either hand, and\nwas hazing them up and down the deck.\n\n\"Mutiny, would you?\" he shrilled. \"You poor swabs! Forgot who was your\ncaptain, did ye? Well, it's Captain Ezra Selover, and you can lay to\nthat! It would need about eight fathom of _stuff_ like you to\ntie me down.\"\n\nHe chased them forward, and he chased them aft, and every time the\npins fell, blood followed. Finally they dived like rabbits into the\nforecastle hatch. Captain Selover leaned down after them.\n\n\"Now tie yourselves up,\" he advised, \"and then come on deck and clean\nup after yourselves!\" He turned to me. \"Mr. Eagen, turn out the crew\nto clean decks.\"\n\nI descended to the forecastle, followed immediately by Handy Solomon.\nThe latter had taken no part in the affair. We found the men in\nhorrible shape, what with the bruises and cuts, and bleeding freely.\n\n\"Now you're a nice-looking Sunday school!\" observed Handy Soloman,\neyeing them sardonically. \"Tackel Old Scrubs, will ye? Well, some\nneeds a bale of cotton to fall on 'em afore they learns anything.\nEnjoyed your little diversions, mates? And w'at do you expect to gain?\nI asks you that, now. You poor little infants! Ain't you never tackled\nhim afore? Don't remember a little brigatine, name of the\n_Petrel!_ My eye, but you _are_ a pack of damn fools!\"\n\nTo this he received no reply. The men sullenly assisted each other.\nThen they went immediately on deck and to work.\n\nAfter this taste of his quality, Captain Selover enjoyed a quiet ship.\nWe made good time, but for a long while nothing happened. Finally the\nmonotony was broken by an incident.\n\nOne evening before the night winds I sat in the shadow of the extra\ndory on top of the deck house. The moon was but just beyond the full,\nso I suppose I must have been practically invisible. Certainly the\n<DW65> did not know of my presence, for he came and stood within three\nfeet of me without giving any sign. The companion was open. In a\nmoment some door below was opened also, and a scrap of conversation\ncame up to us very clearly.\n\n\"You haf dem finished?\" the doctor's voice inquired. \"So, that iss\nwell,\"--papers rustled for a few moments. \"And the r-result--\nah--exactly--it iss that exactly. Percy, mein son, that maigs\nthe experiment exact. We haf the process----\"\n\n\"I don't see, sir, quite,\" replied the voice of Percy Darrow, with\na tinge of excitement. \"I can follow the logic of the experiment, of\ncourse--so can I follow the logic of a trip to the moon. But when you\ncome to apply it--how do you get your re-agent? There's no known\nmethod----\"\n\nDr. Schermerhorn broke in: \"Ach, it iss that I haf perfected. Pardon\nme, my boy, it iss the first I haf worked from you apart. It iss for\na surprise. I haf made in small quantities the missing ingredient.\nIt will form a perfect interruption to the current. Now we go----\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" almost shouted Darrow, \"that you have succeeded\nin freeing it in the metal?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the doctor simply.\n\nI could hear a chair overturned.\n\n\"Why, with that you can----\"\n\n\"I can do everything,\" broke in the doctor. \"The possibilities are\nenormous.\"\n\n\"And you can really produce it in quantity?\"\n\n\"I think so; it iss for us to discover.\"\n\nA pause ensued.\n\n\"Why!\" came the voice of Percy Darrow, awestricken. \"With fifty\ncentigrammes only you could--you could transmute any substance--why,\nyou could make anything you pleased almost! You could make enough\ndiamonds to fill that chest! It is the philosopher's stone!\"\n\n\"Diamonds--yes--it is possible,\" interrupted the doctor impatiently,\n\"if it was worth while. But you should see the real importance----\"\n\nThe ship careened to a chance swell; a door slammed; the voices were\ncut off. I looked up. The <DW65>'s head was thrust forward fairly into\nthe glow from the companionway. The mask of his sullenness had fallen.\nHis eyes fairly rolled in excitement, his thick lips were drawn back\nto expose his teeth, his powerful figure was gathered with the tensity\nof a bow. When the door slammed, he turned silently to glide away.\nAt that instant the watch was changed, and in a moment I found myself\nin my bunk.\n\nTen seconds later the <DW65>, detained by Captain Selover for some\ntrifling duty, burst into the forecastle. He was possessed by the\nwildest excitement. This in itself was enough to gain the attention\nof the men, but his first words were startling.\n\n\"I found de treasure!\" he almost shouted. \"I know where he kept!\"\n\nThey leaped at him--Handy Solomon and Pulz--and fairly shook out of\nhim what he thought he knew. He babbled in the forgotten terms of\nalchemy, dressing modern facts in the garments of mediaeval thought\nuntil they were scarcely to be recognised.\n\n\"And so he say dat he fine him, de Philosopher Stone, and he keep him\nin dat heavy box we see him carry aboard, and he don' have to make\ngol' with it--he can make diamon's--_diamon's_--he say it too\neasy to fill dat box plum full of diamon's.\"\n\nThey gesticulated and exclaimed and breathed hard, full of the marvel\nof such a thought. Then abruptly the clamour died to nothing. I felt\nsix eyes bent on me, six unwinking eyes moving restless in motionless\nfigures, suspicious, deadly as cobras----\n\nUp to now my standing with the men had been well enough. Now they drew\nfrankly apart. One of the most significant indications of this was\nthe increased respect they paid my office. It was as though by prompt\nobedience, instant deference, and the emphasising of ship's etiquette\nthey intended to draw sharply the line between themselves and me.\nThere was much whispering apart, many private talks and consultations\nin which I had no part. Ordinarily they talked freely enough before\nme. Even the reading during the dog watch was intermitted--at least\nit was on such days as I happened to be in the watch below. But twice\nI caught the <DW65> and Handy Solomon consulting together over the\nvolume on alchemy.\n\nI was in two minds whether to report the whole matter to Captain\nSelover. The only thing that restrained me was the vagueness of the\nintention, and the fact that the afterguard was armed, and was four\nto the crew's five. An incident, however, decided me. One evening I\nwas awakened by a sound of violent voices. Captain Selover occasionally\njuggled the watches for variety's sake, and I now had Handy Solomon\nand Perdosa. The <DW65>, being cook, stood no watch.\n\n\"You drunken Greaser swab!\" snarled Handy Solomon. \"You misbegotten\nson of a Yaqui! I'll learn you to step on a seaman's foot, and you\ncan kiss the book on that! I'll cut your heart out and feed it to the\nsharks!\"\n\n\"Potha!\" sneered Perdosa. \"You cut heem you finger wid your knife.\"\n\nThey wrangled. At first I thought the quarrel genuine, but after a\nmoment or so I could not avoid a sort of reminiscent impression of\nthe cheap melodrama. It seemed incredible, but soon I could not dodge\nthe conclusion that it was a made-up quarrel designed to impress me.\n\nWhy should they desire to do so? I had to give it up, but the fact\nitself was obvious enough. I laughed to see them. The affair did not\ncome to blows, but it did come to black looks on meeting, muttered\noaths, growls of enmity every time they happened to pass each other\non the deck. Perdosa was not so bad; his Mexican blood inclined him\nto the histrionic, and his Mexican cast lent itself well to evil looks.\nBut Handy Solomon, for the first time in my acquaintance with him,\nwas ridiculous.\n\nAbout this time we crossed into frequent thunders. One evening just\nat dark we made out a heavy black squall. Not knowing exactly what\nweight lay behind it, I called up all hands. We ducked the staysail\nand foresail, lowered the peak of the mainsail, and waited to feel\nof it--a rough and ready seamanship often used in these little California\nwindjammers. I was pretty busy, but I heard distinctly Handy Solomon's\nvoice behind me.\n\n\"I'll kill you sure, you Greaser, as soon as my hands are free!\"\n\nAnd some muttered reply from the Mexican.\n\nThe wind hit us hard, held on a few moments, and moderated to a stiff\npuff. There followed the rain, so of course I knew it would amount\nto nothing. I was just stooping to throw the stops off the staysail\nwhen I felt myself seized from behind, and forced rapidly toward the\nside of the ship.\n\nOf course I struggled. The Japanese have a little trick to fool a man\nwho catches you around the waist from behind. It is part of the\njiu-jitsu taught the Samurai--quite a different proposition from the\nordinary \"policeman jiu-jitsu.\" I picked it up from a friend in the\nnobility. It came in very handy now, and by good luck a roll of the\nship helped me. In a moment I stood free, and Perdosa was picking\nhimself out of the scuppers.\n\nThe expression of astonishment was fairly well done--I will say that\nfor him--but I was prepared for histrionics.\n\n\"Senor!\" he gasped. \"Eet is you! _Sacrosanta Maria!_ I thought\nyou was dat Solomon! Pardon me, senor! Pardon! Have I hurt you?\"\n\nHe approached me almost wheedling. I could have laughed at the\nvillain. It was all so transparent. He no more mistook me for Handy\nSolomon than he felt any real enmity for that person. But being angry,\nand perhaps a little scared, I beat him to his quarters with a\nbelaying pin.\n\nOn thinking the matter over, however, I failed to see all the ins and\nouts of it. I could understand a desire to get rid of me; there would\nbe one less of the afterguard, and then, too, I knew too much of the\nmen's sentiments, if not of their plans. But why all this elaborate\nfarce of the mock quarrel and the alleged mistake? Could it be to\nguard against possible failure? I could hardly think it worth while.\nMy only theory was that they had wished to test my strength and\ndetermination. The whole affair, even on that supposition, was\nchildish enough, but I referred the exaggerated cunning to Handy\nSolomon, and considered it quite adequately explained. It is a minor\npoint, but subsequently I learned that this surmise was correct. I\nwas to be saved because none of the conspirators understood navigation.\n\nThe next morning I approached Captain Selover.\n\n\"Captain,\" said I, \"I think it my duty to report that there is trouble\nbrewing among the crew.\"\n\n\"There always is,\" he replied, unmoved.\n\n\"But this is serious. Dr. Schermerhorn came aboard with a chest which\nthe men think holds treasure. The other evening Robinson overheard\nhim tell his assistant that he could easily fill the box with diamonds.\nOf course, he was merely illustrating the value of some scientific\nexperiment, but Robinson thinks, and has made the others think, that\nthe chest contains something to make diamonds with. I am sure they\nintend to get hold of it. The affair is coming to a head.\"\n\nCaptain Selover listened almost indifferently.\n\n\"I came back from the islands last year,\" he piped, \"with three\nhundred thousand dollars' worth of pearls. There was sixteen in the\ncrew, and every man of them was blood hungry for them pearls. They\nhad three or four shindies and killed one man over the proper way to\ndivide the loot after they had got it. They didn't get it. Why?\" He\ndrew his powerful figure to its height and spread his thick arms out\nin the luxury of stretching. \"Why?\" he repeated, exhaling abruptly.\n\"Because their captain was Ezra Selover! Well, Mr. Eagen,\" he went\non crisply, \"Captain Ezra Selover is their captain, _and they know\nit_! They'll talk and palaver and git into dark corners, and\nsharpen their knives, and perhaps fight it out as to which one's going\nto work the monkey-doodle business in the doctor's chest, and which\none's going to tie up the sacks of them diamonds, but they won't git\nany farther as long as Captain Ezra is on deck.\" \"Yes,\" I objected,\n\"but they mean business. Last night in the squall one of them tried\nto throw me overboard.\"\n\nCaptain Selover grinned.\n\n\"What did you do?\" he asked.\n\n\"Hazed him to his quarters with a belaying pin.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all settled then, isn't it? What more do you want?\"\n\nI stood undecided.\n\n\"I can take care of myself,\" he went on. \"You ought to take care of\nyourself. Then there's nothing more to do.\"\n\nHe mused a moment.\n\n\"You have a gun, of course?\" he inquired. \"I forgot to ask.\"\n\n\"No,\" said I.\n\nHe whistled.\n\n\"Well, no wonder you feel sort of lost and hopeless! Here, take this,\nit'll make a man of you.\"\n\nHe gave me a Colt's 45, the barrel of which had been filed down to\nabout two inches of length. It was a most extraordinary weapon, but\neffective at short range.\n\n\"Here's a few loose cartridges,\" said he. \"Now go easy. This is no\nwarship, and we ain't got men to experiment on. Lick 'em with your\nfists or a pin, if you can; and if you do shoot, for God's sake just\nwing 'em a little. They're awful good lads, but a little restless.\"\n\nI took the gun and felt better. With it I could easily handle the\nmembers of my own watch, and I did not doubt that with the assistance\nof Percy Darrow even a surprise would hardly overwhelm us. I did not\ncount on Dr. Schermerhorn. He was quite capable of losing himself in\na problem of trajectory after the first shot.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE ISLAND\n\n\nI came on deck one morning at about four bells to find the entire\nship's company afoot. Even the doctor was there. Everybody was gazing\neagerly at a narrow, mountainous island lying slate- across\nthe early morning.\n\nWe were as yet some twenty miles distant from it, and could make out\nnothing but its general outline. The latter was sharply defined,\nrising and falling to a highest point one side of the middle. Over\nthe island, and raggedly clasping its sides, hung a cloud, the only\none visible in the sky.\n\nI joined the afterguard.\n\n\"You see?\" the doctor was exclaiming. \"It iss as I haf said. The\nisland iss there. Everything iss as it should be!\" He was quite\nexcited.\n\nPercy Darrow, too, was shaken out of his ordinary calm.\n\n\"The volcano is active,\" was his only comment, but it explained the\nragged cloud.\n\n\"You say there's a harbour?\" inquired Captain Selover.\n\n\"It should be on the west end,\" said Dr. Schermerhorn.\n\nCaptain Selover drew me one side. He, too was a little aroused.\n\n\"Now wouldn't that get you?\" he squeaked. \"Doctor runs up against a\nNorwegian bum who tells him about a volcanic island, and gives its\nbearings. The island ain't on the map at all. Doctor believes it, and\nmakes me lay my course for those bearings. _And here's the\nisland_! So the bum's story was true! I'd like to know what the\nrest of it was!\" His eyes were shining.\n\n\"Do we anchor or stand off and on?\" I asked.\n\nCaptain Selover turned to grip me by the shoulder.\n\n\"I have orders from Darrow to get to a good berth, to land, to build\nshore quarters, and to snug down for a stay of a year at least!\"\n\nWe stared at each other.\n\n\"Joyous prospect,\" I muttered. \"Hope there's something to do there.\"\n\nThe morning wore, and we rapidly approached the island. It proved to\nbe utterly precipitous. The high rounded hills sloped easily to within\na hundred feet or so of the water and then fell away abruptly. Where\nthe earth ended was a fantastic filigree border, like the fancy paper\nwith which our mothers used to line the pantry shelves. Below, the\nwhite surges flung themselves against the cliffs with a wild abandon.\nThousands of sea birds wheeled in the eddies of the wind, thousands\nof ravens perched on the <DW72>s. With our glasses we could make out\nthe heads of seals fishing outside the surf, and a ragged belt of kelp.\n\nWhen within a mile we put the helm up, and ran for the west end. A\nbold point we avoided far out, lest there should be outlying ledges.\nThen we came in sight of a broad beach and pounding surf.\n\nI was ordered to take a surf boat and investigate for a landing and\nan anchorage. The swell was running high. We rowed back and forth,\npuzzled as to how to get ashore with all the freight it would be\nnecessary to land. The ship would lie well enough, for the only open\nexposure was broken by a long reef over which we could make out the\nseas tumbling. But inshore the great waves rolled smoothly, swiftly--\nthen suddenly fell forward as over a ledge, and spread with a roar\nacross the yellow sands. The fresh winds blew the spume back to us.\nWe conversed in shouts.\n\n\"We can surf the boat,\" yelled Thrackles, \"but we can't land a load.\"\n\nThat was my opinion. We rowed slowly along, parallel to the shore,\nand just outside the line of breakers. I don't know exactly how to\ntell you the manner in which we became aware of the cove. It was as\nnearly the instantaneous as can be imagined. One minute I looked ahead\non a cliff as unbroken as the side of a cabin; the very next I peered\ndown the length of a cove fifty fathoms long by about ten wide, at\nthe end of which was a gravel beach. I cried out sharply to the men.\nThey were quite as much astonished as I. We backed water, watching\nclosely. At a given point the cove and all trace of its entrance\ndisappeared. We could only just make out the line where the headlands\ndissolved into the background of the cliffs, and that merely because\nwe knew of its existence. The blending was perfect.\n\nWe rowed in. The water was still. A faint ebb and flow whispered\nagainst the tiny gravel beach at the end. I noted a practicable way\nfrom it to the top of the cliff, and from the cliff down again to the\nsand beach. Everything was perfect. The water was a beautiful light\ngreen, like semi-opaque glass, and from the indistinctness of its\ndepths waved and beckoned, rose and disappeared with indescribable\ngrace and deliberation long feathery sea growths. In a moment the\nbottom abruptly shallowed. The motion of the boat toward the beach\npermitted us to catch a hasty glimpse of little fish darting, of big\nfish turning, of yellow sand and some vivid colour. Then came the\ngrate of gravel and the scraping of the boat's bottom on the beach.\nWe jumped ashore eagerly. I left the men, very reluctant, and ascended\na natural trail to a high sloping down over which blew the great Trades.\nGrass sprung knee-high. A low hill rose at the back. From below the\nfall of the cliff came the pounding of surf.\n\nI walked to the edge. Various ledges, sloping toward me, ran down to\nthe sea. Against one of them was a wreck, not so very old, head on,\nher afterworks gone. I recognised the name _Golden Horn_, and\nwas vastly astonished to find her here against this unknown island.\nFar up the coast I could see--with the surges dashing up like the explosion\nof shells, and the cliffs, and the rampart of hills grown with grass\nand cactus. A bold promontory terminated the coast view to the north,\nand behind it I could glimpse a more fertile and wooded country. The\nsky was partly overcast by the volcanic murk. It fled before the\nTrades, and the red sun alternately blazed and clouded through it.\n\nAs there was nothing more to be seen here, I turned above the hollow\nof our cove, skirted the base of the hill, and so down to the beach.\n\nIt occupied a wide semicircle where the hills drew back. The flat was\ndry and grown with thick, coarse grass. A stream emerged from a sort\nof canon on its landward side. I tasted it, found it sulphurous, and\na trifle worse than lukewarm. A little nearer the cliff, however, was\na clear, cold spring from the rock, and of this I had a satisfying\ndrink. When I arose from my knees, I made out an animal on the hill\ncrest looking at me, but before I could distinguish its\ncharacteristics it had disappeared.\n\nI returned along the tide sands. The surf dashed and roared, lifting\nseaweeds of a blood red, so that in places the water looked pink.\nSeals innumerable watched me from just outside the breakers. As the\nwaves lifted to a semi-transparence, I could make out others playing,\ndarting back and forth, up and down like disturbed tadpoles, clinging\nto the wave until the very instant of its fall, then disappearing as\nthough blotted out. The salt smell of seaweed was in my nostrils: I\nfound the place pleasant--\n\nWith these few and scattered impressions we returned to the ship. It\nhad been warped to a secure anchorage, and snugged down. Dr.\nSchermerhorn and Darrow were on deck waiting to go ashore.\n\nI made my report. The two passengers disappeared. They carried lunch\nand would not be back until night-fall. We had orders to pitch a large\ntent at a suitable spot and to lighten ship of the doctor's personal\nand scientific effects. By the time this was accomplished, the two\nhad returned.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Darrow volunteered to Captain Selover, as he came\nover the side. \"We've found what we want.\"\n\nTheir clothes were picked by brush and their boots muddy. Next morning\nCaptain Selover detailed me to especial work.\n\n\"You'll take two of the men and go ashore under Darrow's orders,\" said\nhe.\n\nDarrow told us to take clothes for a week, an axe apiece, and a block\nand tackle. We made up our ditty bags, stepped into one of the surf\nboats, and were rowed ashore. There Darrow at once took the lead.\n\nOur way proceeded across the grass flat, through the opening of the\nnarrow canon, and so on back into the interior by way of the bed\nthrough which flowed the sulphur stream. The country was badly eroded.\nMost of the time we marched between perpendicular clay banks about\nforty feet high. These were occasionally broken by smaller tributary\narroyos of the same sort. It would have been impossible to reach the\nlevel of the upper country. The bed of the main arroyo was flat, and\ngrown with grasses and herbage of an extraordinary vividness, due,\nI supposed, to the sulphur water. The stream itself meandered aimlessly\nthrough the broader bed. It steadily grew warmer and the sulphur smell\nmore noticeable. Above us we could see the sky and the sharp clay edge\nof the arroyo. I noticed the tracks of Darrow and Dr. Schermerhorn\nmade the day before.\n\nAfter a mile of this, the bottom ran up nearly to the level of the\nsides, and we stepped out on the floor of a little valley almost\nsurrounded by more hills.\n\nIt was an extraordinary place, and since much happened there, I must\ngive you an idea of it.\n\nIt was round and nearly encircled by naked painted hills. From its\nfloor came steam and a roaring sound. The steam blew here and\nthere among the pines on the floor; rose to eddy about the naked\npainted hills. At one end we saw intermittently a broad ascending\ncanon--deep red and blue-black--ending in the cone of a smoking\nvolcano. The other seemed quite closed by the sheer hills; in fact\nthe only exit was the route by which we had come.\n\nFor the hills were utterly precipitous. I suppose a man might have\nmade his way up the various knobs, ledges, and inequalities, but it\nwould have required long study and a careful head. I, myself, later\nworked my way a short distance, merely to examine the texture of their\nmarvellous colour.\n\nThis was at once varied and of great body--not at all like the smooth,\nglossed colour of most rock, but soft and rich. You've seen painters'\npalettes--it was just like that, pasty and _fat_. There were reds\nof all shades, from a veritable scarlet to a red umber; greens, from\nsea-green to emerald; several kinds of blue, and an indeterminate\npurple-mauve. The whole effect was splendid and barbaric.\n\nWe stopped and gasped as it hit our eyes. Darrow alone was unmoved.\nHe led the way forward and in an instant had disappeared behind the\nveil of steam. Thrackles and Perdosa hung back murmuring, but at a\nsharp word from me gathered their courage in their two hands and proceeded.\n\nWe found that the first veil of steam, and a fearful stench of gases,\nproceeded from a miniature crater whose edge was heavily encrusted\nwith a white salt. Beyond, close under the rise of the hill, was\nanother. Between the two Percy Darrow had stopped and was waiting.\n\nHe eyed us with his lazy, half-quizzical glance as we approached.\n\n\"Think the place is going to blow up?\" he inquired, with a tinge of\nirony. \"Well, it isn't.\" He turned to me. \"Here's where we shall stay\nfor a while. You and the men are to cut a number of these pine trees\nfor a house. Better pick out the little ones, about three or four\ninches through: they're easier handled. I'll be back by noon.\"\n\nWe set to work then in the roaring, steaming valley with the vapour\nswirling about us, sometimes concealing us, sometimes half revealing\nus gigantic, again in the utterness of exposure showing us dwindled\npigmies against the magnitudes about us. The labour was not difficult.\nBy the time Darrow returned we had a pile of the saplings ready for\nhis next direction.\n\nHe was accompanied by the <DW65>, very much terrified, very much\nburdened with food and cooking utensils. The assistant was lazily\nrelating tales of voodoos, a glimmer of mischief in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nCAPTAIN SELOVER LOSES HIS NERVE\n\n\nI lived in the place for three weeks. We were afoot shortly after\ndaybreak, under way by sun-up, and at work before the heats began.\nThree of us worked on the buildings, and the rest formed a pack train\ncarrying all sorts of things from the shore to the valley. The men\ngrumbled fiercely at this, but Captain Selover drove them with slight\nregard for their opinions or feelings.\n\n\"You're getting double pay,\" was his only word, \"earn it!\"\n\nThey certainly earned it during those three weeks. The things they\nbrought up were astounding. Besides a lot of scientific apparatus and\nchests of chemical supplies, everything that could possibly be\nrequired, had been provided by that omniscient young man. After we\nhad built a long, low structure, windows were forthcoming, shelves,\ntables, sinks, faucets, forges, burners, all cut out, fitted and ready\nto put together, each with its proper screws, nails, clamps, or pipes\nready to our hands. When we had finished, we had constructed as\ncomplete a laboratory on a small scale as you could find on a college\ncampus, even to the stone pillar down to bed-rock for delicate\nmicroscopic experiments, and hot and cold water led from the springs.\nAnd we were utterly unskilled. It was all Percy Darrow.\n\nI was toward the last engaged in screwing on a fixture for the\ngeneration of acetelyne gas.\n\n\"Darrow,\" said I, \"there's one thing you've overlooked; you forgot\nto bring a cupola and a gilt weather-cock for this concern.\"\n\nAfter the laboratory was completed, we put up sleeping quarters for\nthe two men, with wide porches well screened, and a square, heavy\nstoreroom. By the end of the third week we had quite finished.\n\nDr. Schermerhorn had turned with enthusiasm to the unpacking of his\nchemical apparatus. Almost immediately at the close of the\nfreight-carrying, he had appeared, lugging his precious chest, this\ntime suffering the assistance of Darrow, and had camped on the spot.\nWe could not induce him to leave, so we put up a tent for him. Darrow\nremained with him by way of safety against the men, whose measure,\nI believe, he had taken. Now that all the work was finished, the doctor\nput in a sudden appearance.\n\n\"Percy,\" said he, \"now we will have the defence built.\"\n\n\nHe dragged us with him to the narrow part of the arroyo, just before\nit rose to the level of the valley.\n\n\"Here we will build the stockade-defence,\" he announced.\n\nDarrow and I stared at each other blankly.\n\n\"What for, sir?\" inquired the assistant.\n\n\"I haf come to be undisturbed,\" announced the doctor, with owl-like,\nTeutonic gravity, \"and I will not be disturbed.\"\n\nDarrow nodded to me and drew his principal aside.\n\nThey conversed earnestly for several minutes. Then the assistant\nreturned to me.\n\n\"No use,\" he shrugged in complete return to his indifferent manner.\n\"Stockade it is. Better make it of fourteen foot logs, slanted out.\nDig a trench across, plant your logs three or four feet, bind them\nat the top. That's his specification for it. Go at it.\"\n\n\"But,\" I expostulated, \"what's the _use_ of it? Even if the men\nwere dangerous, that would just make them think you _did_ have\nsomething to guard.\"\n\n\"I know that. Orders,\" replied Percy Darrow.\n\nWe built the stockade in a day. When it was finished we marched to\nthe beach, and never, save in the three instances of which I shall\nlater tell you, did I see the valley again. The next day we washed\nour clothes, and moved ashore with all our belongings.\n\n\"I'm not going to have this crew aboard,\" stated Captain Selover\npositively, \"I'm going to clean her.\" He himself stayed, however.\n\nWe rowed in, constructed a hasty fireplace of stones, spread our\nblankets, and built an unnecessary fire near the beach.\n\n\"Clean her!\" grumbled Thrackles, \"my eye!\"\n\n\"I'd rather round the Cape,\" growled Pulz hopelessly.\n\n\"Come, now, it can't be as bad as all that,\" I tried to cheer them.\n\"It can't be more than a week or ten days' job, even if we careen her.\"\n\n\"You don't know what you're talking about,\" said Thrackles. \"It's\nworse than the yellow jack. It's six weeks at least. Mind when we last\n'cleaned her'?\" he inquired of Handy Solomon.\n\n\"You can kiss the Book on it,\" replied he. \"Down by the line in that\nlittle swab of a sand island. My eye, but _don't_ I remember!\nI sweated my liver white.\"\n\nThey smoked in silence.\n\n\"That's a main queer contrivance of the Perfessor's--that\nstockade-like,\" ventured Solomon, after a little.\n\n\"He doesn't want any intrusion,\" I said. \"These scientific experiments\nare very delicate.\"\n\n\"Quite like,\" he commented non-committally.\n\nWe slept on the ground that night, and next morning, under Captain\nSelover's directions, we commenced the task of lightening the ship.\nHe detailed the <DW65> and Perdosa for special duty.\n\n\"I'll just see to your shore quarters,\" he squeaked. \"You empty her.\"\n\nAll day long we rowed back and forth from the ship to the cove,\nlanding the contents of the hold. These, by good fortune, we did not\nhave to carry over the neck of land, for just above the gravel beach\nwas a wide ledge on which we could pile the stores. We ate aboard,\nand so had no opportunity of seeing what Captain Selover and his men\nwere about, until evening. Then we discovered that they had collected\nand lowered to the beach a quantity of stateroom doors from the wreck,\nand had trundled the galley stove to the edge where it awaited our\nassistance. We hitched a cable to it, and let it down gently. The\n<DW65> was immensely pleased. After some experiment he got it to draw,\nand so cooked us our supper on it. After supper, Captain Selover rowed\nhimself back to the ship.\n\n\n\"Eagen,\" he had said, drawing me aside, \"I'm going to leave you with\nthem. It's better that one of us--I think as owner I ought to be\naboard----\"\n\n\"Of course, sir,\" said I, \"it's the only proper place for you.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you think so,\" he rejoined, apparently relieved. \"And\nanyway,\" he cried, with a burst of feeling, \"I hate the gritty feeling\nof it under my feet! Solid oak's the only walking for a man.\"\n\nHe left me hastily, as though a trifle ashamed. I thought he seemed\ndepressed, even a little furtive, and yet on analysis I could discover\nnothing definite on which to base such a conclusion.\n\nIt was rather a feeling of difference from the man I had known. In\nmy fatigue it seemed hardly worth thinking about.\n\nThe men had rolled themselves in their blankets, tired with the long\nday.\n\nNext morning Captain Selover was ashore early. He had quite recovered\nhis spirits, and offered me a dram of French brandy, which I refused.\nWe worked hard again; again the master returned at night to his\nvessel, this time without a word to any of us; again the men, drugged\nby toil, turned in early and slept like the dead.\n\nWe became entangled in a mesh of days like these, during which things\nwere accomplished, but in which was no space for anything but the\ntasks imposed upon us. The men for the most part had little to say.\n\n\"Por Dios, eet is too mooch work!\" sighed Perdosa once.\n\n\"Why don't you kick to the Old Man, then?\" sneered Thrackles.\n\nThe silence that followed, and the sullenness with which Perdosa\nreaddressed himself to his work, was significant enough of Captain\nSelover's past relations with the men.\n\nAnd how we did clean her! We stripped her of every stitch and sliver\nuntil she floated high, an empty hull, even her spars and running\nrigging ashore. I understood now the crew's grumbling. We literally\nwent at her with a nail brush.\n\nCaptain Selover took charge of us when we had reached this period.\nHe and the <DW65> and Perdosa had long since finished the installation\nof the permanent camp. They had built us huts from the wreck, collecting\nstateroom doors for the sides, and hatches for the roofs, huge and\nsolid, with iron rings in them. The bronze and iron ventilation\ngratings to the doors gave us glimpses of the coast through fretwork;\nthe rich inlaying of woods surrounded us. We set up on a solid rock\nthe galley stove--with its rails to hold the cooking pots from\nupsetting, in a sea way. In it we burned the debris of the wreck, all\nsorts of wood, some sweet and aromatic and spicy as an incensed\ncathedral. I have seen the <DW65> boiling beans over a blaze of sandal\nwood fragrant as an Eastern shop.\n\nFirst we scrubbed the _Laughing Lass_, then we painted her, and\nresized and tarred her standing rigging, resized and rove her running\ngear, slushed her masts, finally careened her and scraped and painted\nher below.\n\nWhen we had quite finished, we had the anchor chain dealt out to us\nin fathoms, and scraped, pounded and polished that. These were indeed\ndays full of labour.\n\nBeing busy from morning until night we knew but little of what was\nabout us. We saw the open sea and the waves tumbling over the reef\noutside. We saw the headlands, and the bow of the bay and the surf\nwith its watching seals and the curve of yellow sands. We saw the\nsweep of coast and the downs and the strange huts we had built out\nof departed magnificence. And that was all; that constituted our world.\n\nIn the evening sometimes we lit a big bonfire, sailor fashion, just\nat the edge of the beach. There we sat at ease and smoked our pipes\nin silence, too tired to talk. Even Handy Solomon's song was still.\nOutside the circle of light were mysterious things--strange wavings\nof white hands, bendings of figures, callings of voices, rustling of\nfeet. We knew them for the surf and the wind in the grasses: but they\nwere not the less mysterious for that.\n\nLogically Captain Selover and I should have passed most of our\nevenings together. As a matter of fact we so spent very few. Early\nin the dusk the captain invariably rowed himself out to his beloved\nschooner. What he did there I do not know. We could see his light now\nin one part of her, now in the other. The men claimed he was scrubbing\nher teeth. \"Old Scrubs\" they called him to his back: never Captain\nSelover.\n\n\"He has to clean up after his own feet, he's so dirty,\" sagely\nproffered Handy Solomon. And this was true.\n\nThe seaman's prophecy held good. Seven weeks held us at that infernal\njob--seven weeks of solid, grinding work. The worst of it was, that\nwe were kept at it so breathlessly, as though our very existence were\nto depend on the headlong rush of our labour. And then we had fully\nhalf the stores to put away again, and the other half to transport\npainfully over the neck of land from the cove to the beach.\n\nSo accustomed had I become to the routine in which we were involved,\nso habituated to anticipating the coming day as exactly like the day\nthat had gone, that the completion of our job caught me quite by\nsurprise. I had thrown myself down by the fire prepared for the some\nold half hour of drowsy nicotine, to be followed by the accustomed\nheavy sleep, and the usual early rising to toil. The evening was warm;\nI half closed my eyes.\n\nHandy Solomon was coming in last. Instead of dropping to his place,\nhe straddled the fire, stretching his arms over his head. He let them\nfall with a sharp exhalation.\n\n \"'Lay aloft, lay aloft,' the jolly bos'n cried.\n     _Blow high, blow low, what care we!_\n  'Look ahead, look astern, look a-windward, look a-lee.'\n     _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e._\"\n\nThe effect was electrical. We all sprang to our feet and fell to\ntalking at once.\n\n\"By God, we're _through_!\" cried Pulz. \"I'd clean forgot it!\"\n\nThe <DW65> piled on more wood. We drew closer about the fire. All the\ninterests in life, so long held in the background, leaped forward,\neager for recognition. We spoke of trivialities almost for the first\ntime since our landing, fused into a temporary but complete good\nfellowship by the relief.\n\n\"Wonder how the old doctor is getting on?\" ventured Thrackles, after\na while.\n\n\"The devil's a preacher! I wonder?\" cried Handy Solomon.\n\n\"Let's make 'em a call,\" suggested Pulz.\n\n\"Don't believe they'd appreciate the compliment,\" I laughed. \"Better\nlet them make first call: they're the longer established.\" This was\nlost on them, of course. But we all felt kindly to one another that\nevening.\n\nI carried the glow of it with me over until next morning, and was\ntherefore somewhat dashed to meet Captain Selover, with clouded brows\nand an uncertain manner. He quite ignored my greeting.\n\n\"By God, Eagen,\" he squeaked, \"can you think of anything more to be\ndone?\"\n\nI straightened my back and laughed.\n\n\"Haven't you worked us hard enough?\" I inquired. \"Unless you gild the\ncabins, I don't see what else there can be to do.\"\n\nCaptain Selover stared me over.\n\n\"And you a naval man!\" he marvelled. \"Don't you see that the only\nthing that keeps this crew from gettin' restless is keeping them busy?\nI've sweat a damn sight more with my brain than you have with your\nback thinking up things to do. I can't see anything ahead, and then\nwe'll have hell to pay. Oh, they're a sweet lot!\"\n\nI whistled and my crest fell. Here was a new point of view; and also\na new Captain Ezra. Where was the confidence in the might of his two\nhands?\n\nHe seemed to read my thoughts, and went on.\n\n\"I don't feel _sure_ here on this cussed land. It ain't like a\ndeck where a man has some show. They can scatter. They can hide. It\nain't right to put a man ashore alone with such a crew. I'm doing my\nbest, but it ain't goin' to be good enough. I wisht we were safe in\n'Frisco harbour----\"\n\nHe would have maundered on, but I seized his arm and led him out of\npossible hearing of the men.\n\n\"Here, buck up!\" I said to him sternly. \"There's nothing to be scared\nof. If it comes to a row, there's three of us and we've got guns. We\ncould even sail the schooner at a pinch, and leave them here. You've\nstood them off before.\"\n\n\"Not ashore,\" protested Captain Selover weakly.\n\n\"Well, they don't know that. For God's sake don't let them see you've\nlost your nerve this way.\" He did not even wince at the accusation.\n\"Put up a front.\"\n\nHe shook his head. The sand had completely run out of him. Yet I am\nconvinced that if he could have felt the heave and roll of the deck\nbeneath him, he would have faced three times the difficulties he now\nfeared. However, I could see readily enough the wisdom of keeping the\nmen at work.\n\n\"You can wreck the _Golden Horn_,\" I suggested. \"I don't know\nwhether there's anything left worth salvage; but it'll be something\nto do.\"\n\nHe clapped me on the shoulder.\n\n\"Good!\" he cried, \"I never thought of it.\"\n\n\"Another thing,\" said I, \"you better give them a day off a week. That\ncan't hurt them and it'll waste just that much more time.\"\n\n\"All right,\" agreed Captain Selover.\n\n\"Another thing yet. You know I'm not lazy, so it ain't that I'm trying\nto dodge work. But you'd better lay me off. It'll be so much more for\nthe others.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said he.\n\n\n\nI could not recognise the man for what I knew him to be. He groped,\nas one in the dark, or as a sea animal taken out of its element and\nplaced on the sands. Courage had given place to fear; decision to\nwavering; and singleness of purpose to a divided counsel. He who had\nso thoroughly dominated the entire ship, eagerly accepted advice of\nme--a man without experience.\n\nThat evening I sat apart considerably disturbed. I felt that the\nground had dropped away beneath my feet. To be sure, everything was\ntranquil at present; but now I understood the source of that\ntranquillity and how soon it must fail. With opportunity would come\nmore scheming, more speculation, more cupidity. How was I to meet it,\nwith none to back me but a scared man, an absorbed man, and an\nindifferent man?\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nWRECKING OF THE GOLDEN HORN\n\n\nPercy Darrow, unexpected, made his first visit to us the very next\nevening. He sauntered in with a Mexican corn-husk cigarette between\nhis lips, carrying a lantern; blew the light out, and sat down with\na careless greeting, as though he had seen us only the day before.\n\n\"Hullo, boys,\" said he, \"been busy?\"\n\n\"How are ye, sir?\" replied Handy Solomon. \"Good Lord, mates, look at\nthat!\"\n\nOur eyes followed the direction of his forefinger. Against the dark\nblue of the evening sky to northward glowed a faint phosphorescence,\narch-shaped, from which shot, with pulsating regularity, long shafts\nof light. They beat almost to the zenith, and back again, a half dozen\ntimes, then the whole illumination disappeared with the suddenness\nof gas turned out.\n\n\"Now I wonder what that might be!\" marvelled Thrackles.\n\n\"Northern lights,\" hazarded Pulz. \"I've seen them almost like that\nin the Behring Seas.\"\n\n\"Northern lights your eye!\" sneered Handy Solomon. \"You may have seen\nthem in the Behring Seas, but never this far south, and in August,\nand you can, kiss the Book on that.\"\n\n\"What do you think, sir?\" Thrackles inquired of the assistant.\n\n\"Devil's fire,\" replied Percy Darrow briefly. \"The island's a little\nqueer. I've noticed it before.\"\n\n\"Debbil fire,\" repeated the <DW65>.\n\nDarrow turned directly to him.\n\n\"Yes, devil's fire; and devils, too, for all I know; and certainly\nvampires. Did you ever hear of vampires, Doctor?\"\n\n\n\"No,\" growled the <DW65>.\n\n\"Well, they are women, wonderful, beautiful women. A man on a long\nvoyage would just smack his lips to see them. They have shiny grey\neyes, and lips red as raspberries. When you meet them they will talk\nwith you and go home with you. And then when you're asleep they tear\na little hole in your neck with their sharp claws, and they suck the\nblood with their red lips. When they aren't women, they take the shape\nof big bats like birds.\" He turned to me with so beautifully casual\nan air that I wanted to clap him on the back with the joy of it.\n\n\"By the way, Eagen, have you noticed those big bats the last few\nevenings, over by the cliff? _I_ can't make out in the dusk\nwhether they are vampires or just plain bats.\" He directed his remarks\nagain to the <DW65>. \"Next time you see any of those big bats, Doctor,\njust you notice close. If they have just plain, black eyes, they're\nall right; but if they have grey eyes, with red rims around 'em,\nthey're vampires. I wish you'd let me know, if you do find out. It's\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"Don' get me near no bats,\" growled the <DW65>.\n\n\"Where's Selover?\" inquired Darrow.\n\n\"He stays aboard,\" I hastened to say. \"Wants to keep an eye on the\nship.\"\n\n\"That's laudable. What have you been doing?\"\n\n\"We've been cleaning ship. Just finished yesterday evening.\"\n\n\"What next?\"\n\n\"We were thinking of wrecking the _Golden Horn_.\"\n\n\"Quite right. Well, if you want any help with your engines or anything\nof the sort, call on me.\"\n\n\nHe arose and began to light his lantern. \"I hope as how you're getting\non well there above, sir?\" ventured Handy Solomon insinuatingly.\n\n\"Very well, I thank you, my man,\" replied Percy Darrow drily.\n\"Remember those vampires, Doctor.\"\n\nHe swung the lantern and departed without further speech. We followed\nthe spark of it until it disappeared in the arroyo.\n\nBehind us bellowed the sea; over against us in the sky was the dull\nthreatening glow of the volcano; about us were mysterious noises of\ncrying birds, barking seals, rustling or rushing winds. I felt the\nthronging ghosts of all the old world's superstition swirling madly\nbehind us in the eddies that twisted the smoke of our fire.\n\nWe wrecked the _Golden Horn_. Forward was a rusted-out donkey\nengine, which we took to pieces and put together again. It was no mean\njob, for all the running parts had to be cleaned smooth, and with the\nexception of a rudimentary knowledge on the part of Pulz and Perdosa,\nwe were ignorant. In fact we should not have succeeded at all had it\nnot been for Percy Darrow and his lantern. The first evening we took\nhim over to the cliff's edge he laughed aloud.\n\n\"Jove, boys, how could you guess it _all_ wrong,\" he wondered.\n\nWith a few brief words he set us right, Pulz, Perdosa, and I listening\nintently; the others indifferent in the hopelessness of being able\nto comprehend. Of course, we went wrong again in our next day's\nexperiments; but Darrow was down two or three times a week, and\ngradually we edged toward a practical result.\n\nHis explanations consumed but a few moments. After they were finished,\nwe adjourned to the fire.\n\nThus we came gradually to a better acquaintance with the doctor's\nassistant. In many respects he remained always a puzzle, to me.\nCertainly the men never knew how to take him. He was evidently not\nonly unafraid of them, but genuinely indifferent to them.\n\nYet he displayed a certain interest in their needs and affairs. His\npractical knowledge was enormous. I think I have told you of the\ncompleteness of his arrangements--everything had been foreseen from\ngrindstones to gas nippers. The same quality of concrete speculation\nshowed him what we lacked in our own lives.\n\nThere was, as you remember, the matter of Handy Solomon's steel claw.\nHe showed Thrackles a kind of lanyard knot that deep-sea person had\nnever used. He taught Captain Selover how to make soft soap out of\none species of seaweed. Me, he initiated in the art of fishing with\na white bone lure. Our camp itself he reconstructed on scientific lines\nso that we enjoyed less aromatic smoke and more palatable dinner. And\nall of it he did amusedly, as though his ideas were almost too obvious\nto need communication.\n\nWe became in a manner intimate with him. He guyed the men in his\nindolent fashion, playing on their credulity, their good nature, even\ntheir forbearance. They alternately grinned and scowled. He left\nalways a confused impression, so that no one really knew whether he\ncherished rancour against Percy Darrow or kindly feeling.\n\n\nThe <DW65> was Darrow's especial prey. The assistant had early\ndiscovered that the cook was given to signs, omens, and superstitions.\n\nFrom a curious scholar's lore he drew fantastics with which to torment\nhis victim. We heard of all the witches, warlocks, incubi, succibi,\nharpies, devils, imps, and haunters of Avitchi, from all the teachings\nof history, sacred and profane, Hindu, Egyptian, Greek, mediaeval,\nSwedenborg, Rosicrucian, theosophy, theology, with every last ounce\nof horror, mystery, shivers, and creeps squeezed out of them. They\nwere gorgeous ghost stories, for they were told by a man fully informed\nas to all the legendary and gruesome details. At first I used to think\nhe might have communicated it more effectively. Then I saw that the\ncool, drawling manner, the level voice, were in reality the highest\nart. He told his stories in a half-amused, detached manner which imposed\nconfidence more readily than any amount of earnest asseveration. The\nmere fact of his own belief in what he said came to matter little.\nHe was the vehicle by which was brought accurate knowledge. He had\nread all these things, and now reported them as he had read: each man\ncould decide for himself as to their credibility.\n\nAt last the donkey engine was cleared and reinstalled, atop the cliff.\nThe <DW65> built under her a fire of black walnut; Captain Selover\nhanded out grog all around; and we started her up with a cheer, just\nto see the wheels revolve.\n\nNext we half buried some long hatches, end up, to serve as bitts for\nthe lines, hitched our cables to them, and joyfully commenced the task\nof pulling the _Golden Horn_ piece by piece up the side of the\ncliff.\n\nThe stores were badly damaged by the wet, and there was no liquor,\nfor which I was sincerely grateful. We broke into the boxes, and arrayed\nourselves in various garments--which speedily fell to pieces--and\nappropriated gim-cracks of all sorts. There were some arms, but the\nammunition had gone bad. Perdosa, out of forty or fifty mis-fires,\ngot one feeble sputter, and a tremendous _bang_ which blew up\nhis piece, leaving only the stock in his hand. A few tinned goods were\nedible; but all the rest was destroyed. A lot of hard woods, a\nthousand feet of chain cable, and a fairly good anchor might be\nconsidered as prizes. As for the rest, it was foolishness, but we\nhauled it up just the same until nothing at all remained. Then we shut\noff the donkey engine, and put on dry clothes. We had been quite happy\nfor the eight months.\n\nIt was now well along toward spring. The winter had been like summer,\nand with the exception of a few rains of a week or so, we had enjoyed\nbeautiful skies. The seals had thinned out considerably, but were now\nreturning in vast numbers ready for their annual domestic\narrangements.\n\n\nOur Sundays we had mostly spent in resting, or in fishing. There were\nmany deep sea fish to be had, of great palatability, but small\ngameness; they came like so many leaden weights. A few of us had\nclimbed some of the hills in a half-hearted curiosity, but from their\nsummits saw nothing to tempt weariness. Practically we knew nothing\nbeyond the mile or so of beach on which we lived.\n\nCaptain Selover had made a habit of coming ashore at least once during\nthe day. He had contented himself with standing aloof, but I took\npains to seem to confer with him, so that the men might suppose that\nI, as mate, was engaged in carrying out his directions. The dread of\nhim was my most potent influence over them.\n\nDuring the last few days of our wrecking, Captain Selover had omitted\nhis daily visit. The fact made me uneasy, so that at my first\nopportunity I sculled myself out to the schooner. I found him,\nmoist-eyed as usual, leaning against the mainmast doing nothing.\n\n\"We've finished, sir,\" said I.\n\n\nHe looked at me.\n\n\"Will you come ashore and have a look, sir?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I ain't going ashore again,\" he muttered thickly.\n\n\"What!\" I cried.\n\n\"I ain't going ashore again,\" he repeated obstinately, \"and that's\nall there is to it. It's too much of a strain on any man. Suit yourself.\nYou run them. I shipped as captain of a vessel. I'm no dock walloper.\nI won't _do_ it--for no man!\"\n\nI gasped with dismay at the man's complete moral collapse. It seemed\nincredible. I caught myself wondering whether he would recover tone\nwere he again to put to sea.\n\n\"My God, man, but you _must_!\" I cried at last.\n\n\"I won't, and that's flat,\" said he, and turned deliberately on his\nheel and disappeared in the cabin.\n\nI went ashore thoughtful and a little scared. But on reflection I\nregained a great part of my ease of mind. You see, I had been with\nthese men now eight months, during which they had been as orderly as\nso many primary schoolboys. They had worked hard, without grumbling,\nand had even approached a sort of friendliness about the camp fire.\nMy first impression was overlaid. As I looked back on the voyage, with\nwhat I took to be a clearer vision, I could not but admit that the\nincidents were in themselves trivial enough--a natural excitement by\na superstitious <DW64>, a little tall talk that meant nothing. It must\nhave been the glamour of the adventure that had deceived me; that,\nand the unusual stage setting and costuming. Certainly few men would\nwork hard for eight months without a murmur, without a chance to look\nabout them.\n\nIn that, of course, I was deceived by my inexperience. I realised\nlater the wonderful effect Captain Selover threw away with his empty\nbrandy bottles. The crew might grumble and plot during the watch\nbelow; but when Captain Ezra Selover said _work_, they worked.\nHe had been saying work, for eight months. They had, from force of\nexperience, obeyed him. It was all very simple.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE EMPTY BRANDY BOTTLE\n\n\nSo there I was at once deprived of my chief support. Although no\ndanger seemed imminent, nevertheless the necessity of acting on my\nown initiative and responsibility oppressed me somewhat.\n\nTruth to tell, after the first, I was more relieved than dismayed at\nthe captain's resolution to stay aboard. His drinking habit was\ngrowing on him, and afloat or ashore he was now little more than a\nfigurehead, so that my chief asset as far as he was concerned, was\nrather his reputation than his direct influence. In contact with the\nmen, I dreaded lest sooner or later he do something to lessen or\ndestroy the awe in which they held him.\n\nOf course Dr. Schermerhorn had been mistaken in his man: A real\ncaptain of men would have risen to circumstances wherever he found\nthem. But who could have foretold? Captain Selover had been a rascal\nalways, but a successful and courageous rascal. He had run desperate\nchances, dominated desperate crews. Who could know that a crumble of\nisland beach and six months ashore would turn him into what he had\nbecome? Yet I believe such cases are not uncommon in other walks of\nlife. A man and his work combine to mean something; yet both may be\nabsolutely useless when separated. It was the weak link----\n\nI put in some time praying earnestly that the eyes of the crew might\nbe blinded, and that the doctor would finish his experiments before\nthe cauldron could boil up again.\n\nMy first act as real commander was to announce holiday. My idea was\nthat the island would keep the men busy for a while. Then I would\nassign them more work to do. They proposed at once a tour into the\ninterior.\n\nWe started up the west coast. After three or four miles along a mesa\nformation where often we had to circle long detours to avoid the\ngullies, we came upon another short beach, and beyond it a series of\nledges on which basked several hundred seals. They did not seem\nalarmed. In fact one old bull, scarred by many battles, made toward\nus.\n\nWe left him, scaled the cliff, and turned up a broad, pleasant valley\ntoward the interior.\n\nThere the later lava flow had been deflected. All that showed of the\noriginal eruption were occasional red outcropping rocks. Soil and\ngrass had overlaid the mineral. Scattered trees were planted\nthroughout the flat. Cacti and semi-tropical bushes mingled with brush\non the rounded side hills. A number of brilliant birds fluttered at\nour approach.\n\nSuddenly Handy Solomon, who was in advance, stopped and pointed to\nthe crest of the hill. A file of animals moved along the sky line.\n\n\"Mutton!\" said he, \"or the devil's a preacher!\"\n\n\"Sheep!\" cried Thrackles. \"Where did they come from?\"\n\n\"_Golden Horn_,\" I suggested. \"Remember that wide, empty deck\nforward? They carried sheep there.\" The men separated, intending fresh\nmeat. The affair was ridiculous. These sheep had become as wild as\ndeer. Our surrounding party with its silly bared knives could only\nlook after them open-mouthed, as they skipped nimbly between its\nmembers.\n\n\"Get a gun of the Old Man, Mr. Eagen,\" suggested Pulz, \"and we'll have\nsomething besides salt horse and fish.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\nWe continued. The island was like this as far as we went. When we\nclimbed a ridge, we found ourselves looking down on a spider-web of\nother valleys and canons of the same nature, all diverging to broad\ndowns and a jump into the sea, all converging to the outworks that\nguarded the volcano with its canopy of vapour.\n\nOn our way home we cut across the higher country and the heads of the\ncanons until we found ourselves looking down on the valley and Dr.\nSchermerhorn's camp. The steam from the volcanic blowholes swayed\nbelow us. Through its rifts we saw the tops of the buildings.\nPresently we made out Percy Darrow, dressed in overalls, his sleeves\nrolled back, and carrying a retort. He walked, very preoccupied, to\none of the miniature craters, where he knelt and went through some\noperation indistinguishable at the distance. I looked around to see\nmy companions staring at him fascinated, their necks craned out, their\nbodies drawn back into hiding. In a moment he had finished, and\ncarried the retort carefully into the laboratory. The men sighed and\nstood erect, once more themselves. As we turned away Perdosa voiced\nwhat must have been in the minds of all.\n\n\"A man could climb down there,\" said he.\n\n\"Why should he want to?\" I demanded sharply.\n\n\"_Quien sabe_?\" shrugged he.\n\nWe turned in silence toward the beach. Each brooded his thoughts. The\nsight of that man dressed in overalls, carrying on some mysterious\nbusiness, brought home to each of us the fact that our expedition had\nan object, as yet unknown to us. The thought had of late dropped into\nthe background. For my part I had been so immersed in the adventure\nand the labour and the insistent need of the hour that I had forgotten\nwhy I had come. Dr. Schermerhorn's purpose was as inscrutable to me\nas at first. What had I accomplished?\n\nThe men, too, seemed struck with some such idea. There were no yarns\nabout the camp fire that night. Percy Darrow did not appear, for which\nI was sincerely sorry. His presence might have created a diversion.\nFor some unknown reason all my old apprehensions, my sense of\nimpending disaster, had returned to me strengthened. In the firelight\nthe <DW65>'s sullen face looked sinister, Pulz's nervous white\ncountenance looked vicious. Thrackles' heavy, bulldog expression was\nthreatening, Perdosa's Mexican cast fit for knife work in the back.\nAnd Handy Solomon, stretched out, leaning on his elbow, with his red\nheadgear, his snaky hair, his hook nose, his restless eye and his\nglittering steel claw--the glow wrote across his aura the names of\nKid, Morgan, Blackbeard. They sat smoking, staring into the fire with\nmesmerised eyes. The silence got on my nerves I arose impatiently and\nwalked down the pale beach, where the stars glimmered in splashes\nalong the wettest sands. The black silhouette of the hills against\nthe dark blue of the night sky; the white of breakers athwart the\nindistinct heave of the ocean, a faint light marking the position of\nthe _Laughing Lass_--that was everything in the world. I made\nout some object rolled about in the edge of the wash. At the cost of\nwet feet I rescued it. It was an empty brandy bottle.\n\n[Illustration: \"These sheep had become as wild as deer\"]\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nCHANGE OF MASTERS\n\n\nThe next day we continued our explorations by land, and so for a week\nafter that. I thought it best not to relinquish all authority, so I\norganised regular expeditions, and ordered their direction. The men\ndid not object. It was all good enough fun to them.\n\nThe net results were that we found a nesting place of sea birds--too\nlate in the season for eggs; a hot spring near enough camp to be\nuseful; and that was about all. The sheep were the only animals on\nthe island, although there were several sorts of birds. In general,\nthe country was as I have described it--either volcanic or overlaid\nwith fertile earth. In any case it was canon and hill. We soon grew\ntired of climbing and turned our attention to the sea.\n\nWith the surf boat we skirted the coast. It was impregnable except\nin three places: our own beach, that near the seal rookery, and on\nthe south side of the island. We landed at each one of these places.\nBut returning close to the coast we happened upon a cave mouth more\nor less guarded by an outlying rock.\n\nThe day was calm, so we ventured in. At first I thought it merely a\ngorge in the rock, but even while peering for the end wall we slipped\nunder the archway and found ourselves in a vast room.\n\nOur eyes were dazzled so we could make out little at first. But\nthrough the still, clear water the light filtered freely from below,\nshowing the bottom as through a sea glass. We saw the fish near the\nentrance, and coral and sea growths of marvellous vividness. They\nwaved slowly as in a draught of air. The medium in which they floated\nwas absolutely invisible, for, of course, there were no reflections\nfrom its surface. We seemed to be suspended in mid-air, and only when\nthe dipping oars made rings could we realise that anything sustained\nus.\n\nSuddenly the place let loose in pandemonium. The most fiendish cries,\ngroans, shrieks, broke out, confusing themselves so thoroughly with\ntheir own echoes that the volume of sound was continuous. Heavy\nsplashes shook the water. The boat rocked. The invisible surface was\nbroken into facets.\n\nWe shrank, terrified. From all about us glowed hundreds of eyes like\ncoals of fire--on a level with us, above us, almost over our heads.\nTwo by two the coals were extinguished.\n\nBelow us the bottom was clouded with black figures, darting rapidly\nlike a school of minnows beneath a boat. They darkened the coral and\nthe sands and the glistening sea growths just as a cloud temporarily\ndarkens the landscape--only the occultations and brightenings\nsucceeded each other much more swiftly.\n\nWe stared stupefied, our thinking power blurred by the incessent whirl\nof motion and noise.\n\nSuddenly Thrackles laughed aloud.\n\n\"Seals!\" he shouted through his trumpeted hands.\n\nOur eyes were expanding to the twilight. We could make out the arch\nof the room, its shelves, and hollows, and niches. Lying on them we\ncould discern the seals, hundreds and hundreds of them, all staring\nat us, all barking and bellowing. As we approached, they scrambled\nfrom their elevations, and, diving to the bottom, scurried to the entrance\nof the cave.\n\nWe lay on our oars for ten minutes. Then silence fell. There persisted\na tiny _drip, drip, drip_ from some point in the darkness. It\nmerely accentuated the hush. Suddenly from far in the interior of the\nhill there came a long, hollow _boo-o-o-m_! It reverberated,\nroaring. The surge that had lifted our boat some minutes before thus\nreached its journey's end.\n\nThe chamber was very lofty. As we rowed cautiously in, it lost nothing\nof its height, but something in width. It was marvellously ,\nlike all the volcanic rocks of this island. In addition some chemical\ndrip had thrown across its vividness long gauzy streamers of white.\nWe rowed in as far as the faintest daylight lasted us. The occasional\nreverberating _boom_ of the surges seemed as distant as ever.\n\nThis was beyond the seal rookery on the beach. Below it we entered\nan open cleft of some size to another squarer cave. It was now high\ntide; the water extended a scant ten fathoms to end on an interior\nshale beach. The cave was a perfectly straight passage following the\nline of the cleft. How far in it reached we could not determine, for\nit, too, was full of seals, and after we had driven them back a hundred\nfeet or so their fiery eyes scared us out. We did not care to put them\nat bay. The next day I rowed out to the _Laughing Lass_ and got\na rifle. I found the captain asleep in his bunk, and did not disturb\nhim. Perdosa and I, with infinite pains, tracked and stalked the\nsheep, of which I killed one. We found the mutton excellent. The\nhunting was difficult, and the quarry, as time went on, more and more\nsuspicious, but henceforward we did not lack for fresh meat.\nFurthermore we soon discovered that fine trolling was to be had\noutside the reef. We rigged a sail for the extra dory, and spent much\nof our time at the sport. I do not know the names of the fish. They\nwere very gamy indeed, and ran from five to an indeterminate number\nof pounds in weight. Above fifty pounds our light tackle parted, so\nwe had no means of knowing how large they may have been.\n\nThus we spent very pleasantly the greater part of two weeks. At the\nend of that time I made up my mind that it would be just as well to\nget back to business. Accordingly I called Perdosa and directed him\nto sort and clear of rust the salvaged chain cable. He refused flatly.\nI took a step toward him. He drew his knife and backed away.\n\n\"Perdosa,\" said I firmly, \"put up that knife.\"\n\n\"No,\" said he.\n\nI pulled the saw-barrelled Colt's 45 and raised it slowly to a level\nwith his breast.\n\n\"Perdosa,\" I repeated, \"drop that knife.\"\n\nThe crisis had come, but my resolution was fully prepared for it. I\nshould not have cared greatly if I had had to shoot the man--as I\ncertainly should have done had he disobeyed. There would then have\nbeen one less to deal with in the final accounting, which strangely\nenough I now for a moment never doubted would come. I had not before\naimed at a man's life, so you can see to what tensity the baffling\nmystery had strung me.\n\nPerdosa hesitated a fraction of an instant. I really think he might\nhave chanced it, but Handy Solomon, who had been watching me closely,\ngrowled at him.\n\n\"Drop it, you fool!\" he said.\n\nPerdosa let fall the knife.\n\n\"Now, get at that cable,\" I commanded, still at white heat. I stood\nover him until he was well at work, then turned back to set tasks for\nthe other men. Handy Solomon met me halfway.\n\n\"Begging your pardon, Mr. Eagen,\" said he, \"I want a word with you.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say to you,\" I snapped, still excited.\n\n\"It ain't reasonable not to hear a man's say,\" he advised in his most\nconciliatory manner, \"I'm talking for all of us.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, took my silence for consent, and went ahead.\n\n\n\"Begging your pardon, Mr. Eagen,\" said he, \"we ain't going to do any\nmore useless work. There ain't no laziness about us, but we ain't\ngoing to be busy at nothing. All the camp work and the haulin' and\ncuttin' and cleanin' and the rest of it, we'll do gladly. But we ain't\ngoin' to pound any more cable, and you can kiss the Book on that.\"\n\n\"You mean to mutiny?\" I asked.\n\nHe made a deprecatory gesture.\n\n\"Put us aboard ship, sir, and let us hear the Old Man give his orders,\nand you'll find no mutiny in us. But here ashore it's different. Did\nthe Old Man give orders to pound the cable?\"\n\n\"I represent the captain,\" I stammered.\n\nHe caught the evasion. \"I thought so. Well, if you got any kick on\nus, please, sir, go get the Old Man. If he says to our face, pound\ncable, why pound cable it is. Ain't that right, boys?\"\n\nThey murmured something. Perdosa deliberately dropped his hammer and\njoined the group. My hand strayed again toward the sawed-off Colt's\n45.\n\n\"I wouldn't do that,\" said Handy Solomon, almost kindly. \"You couldn't\nkill us all. And w'at good would it do? I asks you that. I can cut\ndown a chicken with my knife at twenty feet. You must surely see, sir,\nthat I could have killed you too easy while you were covering Pancho\nthere. This ain't got to be a war, Mr. Eagen, just because we don't\nwant to work without any sense to it.\"\n\nThere was more of the same sort. I had plenty of time to see my\ndilemma. Either I would have to abandon my attempt to keep the men\nbusy, or I would have to invoke the authority of Captain Selover. To\ndo the latter would be to destroy it. The master had become a stuffed\nfigure, a bogie with which to frighten, an empty bladder that a prick\nwould collapse. With what grace I could muster, I had to give in.\n\n\"You'll have to have it your own way, I suppose,\" I snapped.\n\nThrackles grinned, and Pulz started to say something, but Handy\nSolomon, with a peremptory gesture, and a black scowl, stopped him\nshort.\n\n\"Now that's what I calls right proper and handsome!\" he cried\nadmiringly. \"We reely had no right to expect that, boys, as seamen,\nfrom our first officer! You can kiss the Book on it, that very few\ncrews have such kind masters. Mr. Eagen has the right, and we signed\nto it all straight, to work us as he pleases; and w'at does he do?\nWhy, he up and gives us a week shore leave, and then he gives us light\nwatches, and all the time our pay goes on just the same. Now that's\nw'at I calls right proper and handsome conduct, or the devil's a\npreacher, and I ventures with all respect to propose three cheers for\nMr. Eagen.\"\n\nThey gave them, grinning broadly. The villain stood looking at me,\na sardonic gleam in the back of his eye. Then he gave a little hitch\nto his red head covering, and sauntered away humming between his teeth.\nI stood watching him, choked with rage and indecision. The humming\nbroke into words.\n\n  \"'Oh, quarter, oh, quarter!' the jolly pirates cried.\n     _Blow high, blow low! What care we_?\n  But the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea,\n     _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e_.\"\n\n\"Here, you swab,\" he cried to Thrackles, \"and you, Pancho! get some\nwood, lively! And Pulz, bring us a pail of water. Doctor, let's have\nduff to celebrate on.\"\n\nThe men fell to work with alacrity.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nTHE CORROSIVE\n\n\nThat evening I smoked in a splendid isolation while the men whispered\napart. I had nothing to do but smoke, and to chew my cud, which was\nbitter. There could be no doubt, however I may have saved my face,\nthat command had been taken from me by that rascal, Handy Solomon.\nI was in two minds as to whether or not I should attempt to warn Darrow\nor the doctor. Yet what could I say? and against whom should I warn\nthem? The men had grumbled, as men always do grumble in idleness, and\nhad perhaps talked a little wildly; but that was nothing.\n\nThe only indisputable fact I could adduce was that I had allowed my\nauthority to slip through my fingers. And adequately to excuse that,\nI should have to confess that I was a writer and no handler of men.\n\nI abandoned the unpleasant train of thought with a snort of disgust,\nbut it had led me to another. In the joy and uncertainty of living\nI had practically lost sight of the reason for my coming. With me it\nhad always been more the adventure than the story; my writing was a\nby-product, a utilisation of what life offered me. I had set sail\npossessed by the sole idea of ferreting out Dr. Schermerhorn's\ninvestigations, but the gradual development of affairs had ended by\nabsorbing my every faculty. Now, cast into an eddy by my change of\nfortunes, the original idea regained its force. I was out of the\nactive government of affairs, with leisure on my hands, and my\nthoughts naturally turned with curiosity again to the laboratory in\nthe valley.\n\nDarrow's \"devil fires\" were again painting the sky. I had noticed them\nfrom time to time, always with increasing wonder. The men accepted\nthem easily as only one of the unexplained phenomena of a sailor's\nexperience, but I had not as yet hit on a hypothesis that suited me.\nThey were not allied to the aurora; they differed radically from the\nordinary volcanic emanations; and scarcely resembled any electrical\ndisplays I had ever seen. The night was cool; the stars bright: I\nresolved to investigate.\n\nWithout further delay I arose to my feet and set off into the\ndarkness. Immediately one of the group detached himself from the fire\nand joined me.\n\n\"Going for a little walk, sir?\" asked Handy Solomon sweetly. \"That's\nquite right and proper. Nothin' like a little walk to get you fit and\nright for your bunk.\"\n\nHe held close to my elbow. We got just as far as the stockade in the\nbed of the arroyo. The lights we could make out now across the zenith;\nbut owing to the precipitance of the cliffs, and the rise of the\narroyo bed, it was impossible to see more. Handy Solomon felt the\ndefences carefully.\n\n\"A man would think, sir, it was a cannibal island,\" he observed. \"All\nso tight and tidy-like here. It would take a ship's guns to batter\nher down. A man might dig under these here two gate logs, if no one\nwas against him. Like to try it, sir?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered gruffly.\n\nFrom that time on I was virtually a prisoner; yet so carefully was\nmy surveillance accomplished that I could place my finger on nothing\ndefinite. Someone always accompanied me on my walks; and in the\nevening I was herded as closely as any cattle.\n\nHandy Solomon took the direction of affairs off my hands. You may be\nsure he set no very heavy tasks. The men cut a little wood, carried\nup a few pails of water--that was all.\n\nLacking incentive to stir about, they came to spend most of their time\nlying on their backs watching the sky. This in turn bred a languor\nwhich is the sickest, most soul- and temper-destroying affair invented\nby the devil. They could not muster up energy enough to walk down the\nbeach and back, and yet they were wearied to death of the inaction.\nAfter a little they became irritable toward one another. Each\nsuspected the other of doing less than he should. You who know men\nwill realise what this meant.\n\nThe atmosphere of our camp became surly. I recognised the precursor\nof its becoming dangerous. One day on a walk in the hills I came on\nThrackles and Pulz lying on their stomachs gazing down fixedly at Dr.\nSchermerhorn's camp. This was nothing extraordinary, but they started\nguiltily to their feet when they saw me, and made off, growling under\ntheir breaths.\n\nAll this that I have told you so briefly, took time. It was the eating\nthrough of men's spirits by that worst of corrosives, idleness. I\nconceive it unnecessary to weary you with the details----\n\nThe situation was as yet uneasy but not alarming. One evening I\noverheard the beginning of an absurd plot to gain entrance to the\nValley--that was as far as detail went. I became convinced at last\nthat I should in some way warn Percy Darrow.\n\nThat seems a simple enough proposition, does it not? But if you will\nstop to think one moment of the difficulties of my position, you will\nsee that it was not as easy as at first it appears. Darrow still\nvisited us in the evening. The men never allowed me even the chance\nof private communication while he was with us. One or two took pains\nto stretch out between us. Twice I arose when the assistant did, resolved\nto accompany him part way back. Both times men resolutely escorted\nus, and as resolutely separated us from the opportunity of a single\nword apart. The crew never threatened me by word or look. But we understood\neach other.\n\nI was not permitted to row out to the _Laughing Lass_ without\nescort. Therefore I never attempted to visit her again. The men were\nnot anxious to do so, their awe of the captain made them only too glad\nto escape his notice. That empty shell of a past reputation was my\nonly hope. It shielded the arms and ammunition.\n\nAs I look back on it now, the period seems to me to be one of merely\npotential trouble. The men had not taken the pains to crystallise\ntheir ideas. I really think their compelling emotion was that of\ncuriosity. They wanted to _see_. It needed a definite impulse\nto change that desire to one of greed.\n\nThe impulse came from Percy Darrow and his idle talk of voodoos. As\nusual he was directing his remarks to the sullen <DW65>.\n\n\"Voodoos?\" he said. \"Of course there are. Don't fool yourself for a\nminute on that. There are good ones and bad ones. You can tame them\nif you know how, and they will do anything you want them to.\" Pulz\nchuckled in his throat. \"You don't believe it?\" drawled the assistant\nturning to him. \"Well, it's so. You know that heavy box we are so\ncareful of? Well, that's got a tame voodoo in it.\"\n\nThe others laughed.\n\n\"What he like?\" asked the <DW65> gravely.\n\n\"He's a fine voodoo, with wavery arms and green eyes, and red glows.\"\nWatching narrowly its effect he swung off into one of the genuine old\ncrooning voodoo songs, once so common down South, now so rarely heard.\nNo one knows what the words mean--they are generally held to be\ncharm-words only--a magic gibberish. But the <DW65> sprang across the\nfire like lightning, his face altered by terror, to seize Darrow by\nthe shoulders.\n\n\"Doan you! Doan you!\" he gasped, shaking the assistant violently back\nand forth. \"Dat he King Voodoo song! Dat call him all de voodoo--all!\"\n\nHe stared wildly about in the darkness as though expecting to see the\nnight thronged. There was a moment of confusion. Eager for any chance\nI hissed under my breath; \"Danger! Look out!\"\n\nI could not tell whether or not Darrow heard me. He left soon after.\nThe mention of the chest had focussed the men's interest.\n\n\"Well,\" Pulz began, \"we've been here on this spot o' hell for a long\ntime.\"\n\n\"A year and five months,\" reckoned Thrackles.\n\n\"A man can do a lot in that time.\"\n\n\"If he's busy.\"\n\n\"They've been busy.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Wonder what they've done?\"\n\nThere was no answer to this, and the sea lawyer took a new tack.\n\n\"I suppose we're all getting double wages.\"\n\n\"That's so.\"\n\n\"And that's say four hunder' for us and Mr. Eagen here. I suppose the\nOld Man don't let the schooner go for nothing.\"\n\n\"Two hundred and fifty a month,\" said I, and then would have had the\nwords back.\n\nThey cried out in prolonged astonishment.\n\n\"Seventeen months,\" pursued the logician after a few moments. He\nscratched with a stub of lead. \"That makes over eleven thousand\ndollars since we've been out. How much do you suppose his outfit\nstands him?\" he appealed to me.\n\n\"I'm sure I can't tell you,\" I replied shortly.\n\n\"Well, it's a pile of money, anyway.\"\n\nNobody said anything for some time.\n\n\"Wonder what they've done?\" Pulz asked again.\n\n\"Something that pays big.\" Thrackles supplied the desired answer.\n\n\"Dat chis'----\" suggested Perdosa.\n\n\"Voodoo----\" muttered the <DW65>.\n\n\"That's to scare us out,\" said Handy Solomon, with vast contempt.\n\"That's what makes me sure it _is_ the chest.\"\n\nPulz muttered some of the jargon of alchemy.\n\n\"That's it,\" approved Handy Solomon. \"If we could get----\"\n\n\"We wouldn't know how to use it,\" interrupted Pulz.\n\n\"The book----\" said Thrackles.\n\n\"Well, the book----\" asserted Pulz pugnaciously.\n\n\"How do you know what it will be? It may be the Philosopher's Stone\nand it may be one of these other damn things. And then where'd we be?\"\n\nIt was astounding to hear this nonsense bandied about so seriously.\nAnd yet they more than half believed, for they were deep-sea men of\nthe old school, and this was in print. Thrackles voiced approximately\nthe general attitude.\n\n\"Philosopher's stone or not, something's up. The old boy took too good\ncare of that box, and he's spending too much money, and he's got hold\nof too much hell afloat to be doing it for his health.\"\n\n\"You know w'at I t'ink?\" smiled Perdosa. \"He mak' di'mon's. He\n_say_ dat.\"\n\nThe <DW65> had entered one of his black, brooding moods from which\nthese men expected oracles.\n\n\"Get him ches',\" he muttered. \"I see him full--full of di'mon's!\"\n\nThey listened to him with vast respect, and were visibly impressed.\nSo deep was the sense of awe that Handy Solomon unbent enough to whisper\nto me:\n\n\"I don't take any stock in the <DW65>'s talk _ordinarily_. He's\na hell of a fool <DW65>. But when his eye looks like that, then you\nwant to listen close. He sees things then. Lots of times he's seen\nthings. Even last year--the _Oyama_--he told about her three days\nahead. That's why we were so ready for her,\" he chuckled.\n\nNothing more developed for a long time except a savage fight between\nPulz and Perdosa. I hunted sheep, fished, wandered about--always with\nan escort tired to death before he started. The thought came to me\nto kill this man and so to escape and make cause with the scientists.\nMy common sense forbade me. I begin to think that common sense is a\nvery foolish faculty indeed.\n\nIt taught me the obvious--that all this idle, vapouring talk was\ncommon enough among men of this class, so common that it would hardly\njustify a murder, would hardly explain an unwarranted intrusion on\nthose who employed me. How would it look for me to go to them with\nthese words in my mouth:\n\n\"The captain has taken to drinking to dull the monotony. The crew\nthink you are an alchemist and are making diamonds. Their interest\nin this fact seemed to me excessive, so I killed one of them, and here\nI am.\"\n\n\"And who are you?\" they could ask.\n\n\"I am a reporter,\" would be my only truthful reply.\n\nYou can see the false difficulties of my position. I do not defend\nmy attitude. Undoubtedly a born leader of men, like Captain Selover\nat his best, would have known how to act with the proper decision both\nnow and in the inception of the first mutiny. At heart I never doubted\nthe reality of the crisis.\n\nEven Percy Darrow saw the surliness of the men's attitudes, and with\nhis usual good sense divined the cause.\n\n\"You chaps are getting lazy,\" said he, \"why don't you do something?\nWhere's the captain?\"\n\nThey growled something about there being nothing to do, and explained\nthat the captain preferred to live aboard.\n\n\"Don't blame him,\" said Darrow, \"but he might give us a little of his\nsqueaky company occasionally. Boys, I'll tell you something about\nseals. The old bull seals have long, stiff whiskers--a foot long. Do\nyou know there's a market for those whiskers? Well, there is. The\nChinese mount them in gold and use them for cleaners for their long\npipes. Each whisker is worth from six bits to a dollar and a quarter.\nWhy don't you kill a few bull seal for the 'trimmings'?\"\n\n\"Nothin' to do with a voodoo?\" grunted Handy Solomon.\n\nDarrow laughed amusedly. \"No, this is the truth,\" he assured. \"I'll\ntell you what: I'll give you boys six bits apiece for the whisker\nhairs, and four bits for the galls. I expect to sell them at a\nprofit.\"\n\nNext morning they shook off their lethargy and went seal-hunting.\nI was practically commanded to attend. This attitude had been growing\nof late: now it began to take a definite form.\n\n\"Mr. Eagan, don't you want to go hunting?\" or \"Mr. Eagen, I guess I'll\njust go along with you to stretch my legs,\" had given way to, \"We're\ngoing fishing: you'd better come along.\"\n\nI had known for a long time that I had lost any real control of them;\nand that perhaps humiliated me a little. However, my inexperience at\nhandling such men, and the anomalous character of my position to some\nextent consoled me. In the filaments brushed across the face of my\nunderstanding I could discover none so strong as to support an overt\nact on my part. I cannot doubt, that had the affair come to a focus,\nI should have warned the scientists even at the risk of my life. In\nfact, as I shall have occasion to show you, I did my best. But at the\nmoment, in all policy I could see my way to little besides\nacquiescence.\n\nWe killed seals by sequestrating the bulls, surrounding them, and\nclubbing them at a certain point of the forehead. It was surprising\nto see how hard they fought, and how quickly they succumbed to a blow\nproperly directed. Then we stripped the mask with its bristle of long\nwhiskers, took the gall, and dragged the carcass into the surf where\nit was devoured by fish. At first the men, pleased by the novelty,\nstripped the skins. The blubber, often two or three inches in\nthickness, had then to be cut away from the pelt, cube by cube. It\nwas a long, an oily, and odoriferous job. We stunk mightily of seal\noil; our garments were shiny with it, the very pores of our skins seemed\nto ooze it. And even after the pelt was fairly well cleared, it had\nstill to be tanned. Percy Darrow suggested the method, but the process\nwas long, and generally unsatisfactory. With the acquisition of the\nfifth greasy, heavy, and ill-smelling piece of fur the men's interest\nin peltries waned. They confined themselves in all strictness to the\n\"trimmings.\"\n\nPercy Darrow showed us how to clean the whiskers. The process was\nevil. The masks were, quite simply, to be advanced so far in the way\nof putrefaction that the bristles would part readily from their\nsockets. The first batch the men hung out on a line. A few moments\nlater we heard a mighty squawking, and rushed out to find the island\nravens making off with the entire catch. Protection of netting had\nto be rigged. We caught seals for a month or so. There was novelty\nin it, and it satisfied the lust for killing. As time went on, the\nbulls grew warier. Then we made expeditions to outlying rocks.\n\nLater Handy Solomon approached me on another diplomatic errand.\n\n\"The seals is getting shy, sir,\" said he.\n\n\"They are,\" said I.\n\n\"The only way to do is to shoot them,\" said he.\n\n\"Quite like,\" I agreed.\n\nA pause ensued.\n\n\"We've got no cartridges,\" he insinuated.\n\n\"And you've taken charge of my rifle,\" I pointed out.\n\n\"Oh, not a bit, sir,\" he cried. \"Thrackles, he just took it to clean\nit--you can have it whenever you want it, sir.\"\n\n\"I have no cartridges--as you have observed,\" said I.\n\n\"There's plenty aboard,\" he suggested.\n\n\"And they're in very good hands there,\" said I.\n\nHe ruminated a moment, polishing the steel of his hook against the\nother arm of his shirt. Suddenly he looked up at me with a humorous\ntwinkle.\n\n\"You're afraid of us!\" he accused.\n\nI was silent, not knowing just how to meet so direct an attack.\n\n\"No need to be,\" he continued.\n\nI said nothing.\n\nHe looked at me shrewdly; then stood off on another tack.\n\n\"Well, sir, I didn't mean just that. I didn't mean you was really\nscared of us. But we're gettin' to know each other, livin' here on\nthis old island, brothers-like. There ain't no officers and men\nashore--is there, now, sir? When we gets back to the old _Laughing\nLass_, then we drops back into our dooty again all right and\nproper. You can kiss the Book on that. Old Scrubs, he knows that. He\ndon't want no shore in his. _He_ knows enough to stay aboard,\nwhere we'd all rather be.\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly, spat, and looked at me. I wondered whither this\ndevious diplomacy led us.\n\n\"Still, in one way, an officer's an officer, and a seaman's a seaman,\nthinks you, and discipline must be held up among mates ashore or\nafloat, thinks you. Quite proper, sir. And I can see you think that\nthe arms is for the afterguard except in case of trouble. Quite\nproper. You can do the shooting, and you can keep the cartridges\nalways by you. Just for discipline, sir.\"\n\nThe man's boldness in so fully arming me was astonishing, and his\ncarelessness in allowing me aboard with Captain Selover astonished\nme still more. Nevertheless I promised to go for the desired cartridges,\nfully resolved to make an appeal.\n\nA further consideration of the elements of the game convinced me,\nhowever, of the fellow's shrewdness. It was no more dangerous to allow\nme a rifle--under direct surveillance--for the purposes of hunting,\nthan to leave me my sawed--off revolver, which I still retained. The\narguments he had used against my shooting Perdosa were quite as cogent\nnow. As to the second point, I, finding the sun unexpectedly strong,\nreturned from the cove for my hat, and so overheard the following\nbetween Thrackles and his leader:\n\n\"What's to keep him from staying aboard?\" cried Thrackles, protesting.\n\n\"Well, he might,\" acknowledged Handy Solomon, \"and then are we the\nworse off? You ain't going to make a boat attack against Old Scrubs,\nare you?\"\n\nThrackles hesitated.\n\n\"You can kiss the Book on it, you ain't,\" went on Handy Solomon\neasily, \"nor me, nor Pulz, nor the Greaser, nor the <DW65>, nor none\nof us all together. We've had our dose of that. Well, if he goes\naboard and _stays_, where are we the worse off? I asks you that.\nBut he won't. This is w'ats goin' to happen. Says he to Old Scrubs,\n'Sir, the men needs you to bash in their heads.' 'Bash 'em in\nyourself,' says he, 'that's w'at you're for.' And if he should come\nashore, w'at could he do? I asks you that. We ain't disobeyed no\norders dooly delivered. We're ready to pull halliards at the word.\nNo, let him go aboard, and if he peaches to the Old Man, why all the\nbetter, for it just gets the Old Man down on him.\"\n\n\"How about Old Scrubs----\"\n\n\"Don't you believe none in luck?\" asked Handy Solomon. \"Aye.\"\n\n\"Well, so do I, with w'at that law-crimp used to call joodicious\nassistance.\"\n\nI rowed out to the _Laughing Lass_ very thoughtful, and a little\nshaken by the plausible argument. Captain Selover was lying dead drunk\nacross the cabin table. I did my best to waken him, but failed, took\na score of cartridges--no more--and departed sadly. Nothing could be\ngained by staying aboard; every chance might be lost. Besides, an\nopening to escape in the direction of the laboratory might offer--I,\nas well as they, believed in luck judiciously assisted.\n\nIn the ensuing days I learned much of the habits of seals. We sneaked\nalong the cliff tops until over the rookeries; then lay flat on our\nstomachs and peered cautiously down on our quarry. The seals had\nbecome very wary. A slight jar, the fall of a pebble, sometimes even\nsounds unnoticed by ourselves, were enough to send them into the\nwater. There they lined up just outside the surf, their sleek heads\nglossy with the wet, their calm, soft eyes fixed unblinkingly on us.\n\nIt was useless to shoot them in the water: they sank at once.\n\nWhen, however, we succeeded in gaining an advantageous position, it\nwas necessary to shoot with extreme accuracy. A bullet directly\nthrough the back of the head would kill cleanly. A hit anywhere else\nwas practically useless, for even in death the animals seemed to\nretain enough blind instinctive vitality to flop them into the water.\nThere they were lost.\n\nEach rookery consisted of one tremendous bull who officiated\napparently as the standing army; a number of smaller bulls, his direct\ndescendants; the cows, and the pups. The big bull held his position\nby force of arms. Occasionally other, unattached, bulls would come\nswimming by. On arriving opposite the rookery the stranger would utter\na peculiar challenge. It was never refused by the resident champion,\nwho promptly slid into the sea, and engaged battle. If he conquered,\nthe stranger went on his way. If, however, the stranger won, the big\nbull immediately struck out to sea, abandoning his rookery, while the\nnew-comer swam in and attempted to make his title good with all the\nyounger bulls. I have seen some fierce combats out there in the blue\nwater. They gashed each other deep----\n\nYou can see by this how our hunting was never at an end. On Tuesday\nwe would kill the boss bull of a certain establishment. By Thursday,\nat latest, another would be installed.\n\nI learned curious facts about seals in those days. The hunting did\nnot appeal to me particularly, because it seemed to me useless to kill\nso large an animal for so small a spoil. Still, it was a means to my\nall-absorbing end, and I confess that the stalking, the lying belly\ndown on the sun-warmed grass over the surge and under the clear sky,\nwas extremely pleasant. While awaiting the return of the big bull often\nwe had opportunity to watch the others at their daily affairs, and\neven the unresponsive Thrackles was struck with their almost human\nintelligence. Did you know that seals kiss each other, and weep tears\nwhen grieved?\n\nThe men often discussed among themselves the narrow, dry cave. There\nthe animals were practically penned in. They agreed that a great\nkilling could be made there, but the impossibility of distinguishing\nbetween the bulls and the cows deterred them. The cave was quite dark.\n\nImmerced in our own affairs thus, the days, weeks, and months went\nby. Events had slipped beyond my control. I had embarked on a journalistic\nenterprise, and now that purpose was entirely out of my reach.\n\nUp the valley Dr. Schermerhorn and his assistant were engaged in some\nexperiment of whose very nature I was still ignorant. Also I was\nlikely to remain so. The precautions taken against interference by\nthe men were equally effective against me. As if that were not enough,\nany move of investigation on my part would be radically misinterpreted,\nand to my own danger, by the men. I might as well have been in London.\n\nHowever, as to my first purpose in this adventure I had evolved\nanother plan, and therefore was content. I made up my mind that on\nthe voyage home, if nothing prevented, I would tell my story to Percy\nDarrow, and throw myself on his mercy. The results of the experiment\nwould probably by then be ready for the public, and there was no\nreason, as far as I could see, why I should not get the \"scoop\" at\nfirst hand.\n\nCertainly my sincerity would be without question; and I hoped that\ntwo years or more of service such as I had rendered would tickle Dr.\nSchermerhorn's sense of his own importance. So adequate did this plan\nseem, that I gave up thought on the subject.\n\nMy whole life now lay on the shores. I was not again permitted to\nboard the _Laughing Lass_. Captain Selover I saw twice at a\ndistance. Both times he seemed to be rather uncertain. The men did\nnot remark it. The days went by. I relapsed into that state so well\nknown to you all, when one seems caught in the meshes of a dream existence\nwhich has had no beginning and which is destined never to have an end.\n\nWe were to hunt seals, and fish, and pry bivalves from the rocks at\nlow tide, and build fires, and talk, and alternate between suspicion\nand security, between the danger of sedition and the insanity of men\nwithout defined purpose, world without end forever.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\"OLD SCRUBS\" COMES ASHORE\n\n\nThe inevitable happened. One noon Pulz looked up from his labour of\npulling the whiskers from the evil-smelling masks.\n\n\n\"How many of these damn things we got?\" he inquired.\n\n\"About three hunder' and fifty,\" Thrackles replied.\n\n\"Well, we've got enough for me. I'm sick of this job. It stinks.\"\n\nThey looked at each other. I could see the disgust rising in their\neyes, the reek of rotten blubber expanding their nostrils. With one\naccord they cast aside the masks.\n\n\"It ain't such a hell of a fortune,\" growled Pulz, his evil little\nwhite face thrust forward. \"There's other things worth all the seal\ntrimmin's of the islands.\"\n\n\"Diamon's,\" gloomed the <DW65>.\n\n\"You've hit it, Doctor,\" cut in Solomon.\n\nThere we were again, back to the old difficulty, only worse. Idleness\ndescended on us again. We grew touchy on little things, as a misplaced\nplate, a shortage of firewood, too deep a draught at the nearly empty\nbucket. The noise of bickering became as constant as the noise of the\nsurf. If we valued peace, we kept our mouths shut. The way a man spat,\nor ate, or slept, or even breathed became a cause of irritation to\nevery other member of the company. We stood the outrage as long as\nwe could; then we objected in a wild and ridiculous explosion which\ncommunicated its heat to the object of our wrath. Then there was a\nfight. It needed only liquor to complete the deplorable state of\naffairs.\n\nGradually the smaller things came to worry us more and more. A certain\nharmless singer of the cricket or perhaps of the tree-toad variety\nused to chirp his innocent note a short distance from our cabin. For\nall I know he had done so from the moment of our installation, but\nI had never noticed him before. Now I caught myself listening for his\nirregular recurrence with every nerve on the quiver. If he delayed\nby ever so little, it was an agony; yet when he did pipe up, his feeble\nstrain struck to my heart cold and paralysing like a dagger. And with\nevery advancing minute of the night I became broader awake, more\ntense, fairly sweating with nervousness. One night--good God, was it\nonly last week? ... it seems ages ago, another existence ... a state\ncut off from this by the wonder of a transmigration, at least ... Last\nweek!\n\nI did not sleep at all. The moon had risen, had mounted the heavens,\nand now was sailing overhead. By the fretwork of its radiance through\nthe chinks of our rudely-built cabin I had marked off the hours. A\nthunderstorm rumbled and flashed, hull down over the horizon. It was\nmany miles distant, and yet I do not doubt that its electrical\ninfluence had dried the moisture of our equanimity, leaving us\nrattling husks for the winds of destiny to play upon. Certainly I can\nremember no other time, in a rather wide experience, when I have felt\nmyself more on edge, more choked with the restless, purposeless\nnervous energy that leaves a man's tongue parched and his eyes\nstaring. And still that infernal cricket, or whatever it was, chirped.\n\nI had thought myself alone in my vigil, but when finally I could stand\nit no longer, and kicked aside my covering with an oath of protest,\nI was surprised to hear it echoed from all about me.\n\n\"Damn that cricket!\" I cried.\n\nAnd the dead shadows stirred from the bunks, and the hollow-eyed\nvictims of insomnia crept out to curse their tormentor. We organised\nan expedition to hunt him down. It was ridiculous enough, six strong\nmen prowling for the life of one poor little insect. We did not find\nhim, however, though we succeeded in silencing him. But no sooner were\nwe back in our bunks than he began it again, and such was the turmoil\nof our nerves that day found us sitting wan about a fire, hugging our\nknees.\n\nWe were so genuinely emptied, not so much by the cricket as by the\ntwo years of fermentation, that not one of us stirred toward breakfast,\nin fact not one of us moved from the listless attitude in which day\nfound him, until after nine o'clock. Then we pulled ourselves together\nand cooked coffee and salt horse. As a significant fact, the <DW65>\nleft the dishes unwashed, and no one cared.\n\nHandy Solomon finally shook himself and arose.\n\n\"I'm sick of this,\" said he, \"I'm goin' seal-hunting.\"\n\nThey arose without a word. They were sick of it, too, sick to death.\nWe were a silent, gloomy crew indeed as we thrust the surf boat\nafloat, clambered in, and shipped the oars. No one spoke a word; no\none had a comment to make, even when we saw the rookery slide into\nthe water while we were still fifty yards from the beach. We pulled\nback slowly along the coast. Beyond the rock we made out the entrance\nto the dry cave.\n\n\"There's seal in there,\" cried Handy Solomon, \"lots of 'em!\"\n\nHe thrust the rudder over, and we headed for the cave. No one\nexpressed an opinion.\n\nAs it was again high tide, we rowed in to the steep shore inside the\ncave's mouth and beached the boat. The place was full of seals; we\ncould hear them bellowing.\n\n\"Two of you stand here,\" shouted Handy Solomon, \"and take them as they\ngo out. We'll go in and scare 'em down to you.\"\n\n\"They'll run over us,\" screamed Pulz.\n\n\"No, they won't. You can dodge up the sides when they go by.\"\n\nThis was indeed well possible, so we gripped our clubs and ventured\ninto the darkness.\n\nWe advanced four abreast, for the cave was wide enough for that. As\nwe penetrated, the bellowing and barking became more deafening.\nIt was impossible to see anything, although we _felt_ an\nindistinguishable tumbling mass receding before our footsteps.\nThrackles swore violently as he stumbled over a laggard. With uncanny\nabruptness the black wall of darkness in front of us was alive with\nfiery eyeballs. The seals had reached the end of the cave and had\nturned toward us. We, too, stopped, a little uncertain as to how to\nproceed.\n\nThe first plan had been to get behind the band and to drive it slowly\ntoward the entrance to the cave. This was now seen to be impossible.\nThe cavern was too narrow; its sides at this point too steep, and the\nanimals too thickly congested. Our eyes, becoming accustomed to the\ntwilight, now began to make out dimly the individual bodies of the\nseals and the general configuration of the rocks. One big boulder lay\ndirectly in our path, like an island in the shale of the cave's floor.\nPerdosa stepped to the top of it for a better look. The men attempted\nto communicate their ideas of what was to be done, but could not make\nthemselves heard above the uproar. I could see their faces contorting\nwith the fury of being baffled. A big bull made a dash to get by; all\nthe herd flippered after him. If he had won past they would have\nfollowed as obstinately as sheep, and nothing could have stopped them,\nbut the big bull went down beneath the clubs. Thrackles hit the animal\ntwo vindictive blows after it had succumbed.\n\nThis settled the revolt, and we stood as before. Pulz and Handy\nSolomon tried to converse by signs, but evidently failed, for their\nfaces showed angry in the twilight. Perdosa, on his rock, rolled and\nlit a cigarette. Thrackles paced to and fro, and the <DW65> leaned\non his club, farther down the cave. They had been left at the entrance,\nbut now in lack of results had joined their companions.\n\nNow Thrackles approached and screamed himself black trying to impart\nsome plan. He failed; but stooped and picked up a stone and threw it\ninto the mass of seals. The others understood. A shower of stones\nfollowed. The animals milled like cattle, bellowed the louder, but\nwould not face their tormentors. Finally an old cow flopped by in a\npanic. I thought they would have let her go, but she died a little\nbeyond the bull. No more followed, although the men threw stones as\nfast and hard as they were able. Their faces were livid with anger,\nlike that of an evil-tempered man with an obstinate horse.\n\nSuddenly Handy Solomon put his head down, and with a roar distinctly\naudible even above the din that filled the cave, charged directly into\nthe herd. I saw the beasts cringe before him; I saw his club rising\nand falling indiscriminately; and then the whole back of the cave\nseemed to rise and come at us.\n\nThis was no chance of sport now, but a struggle for very life. We\nrealised that once down there would be no hope, for while the seals\nwere more anxious to escape than to fight, we knew that their jaws\nwere powerful. There was no time to pick and choose. We hit out with\nall the strength and quickness we possessed. It was like a bad dream,\nlike struggling with an elusive hydra-headed monster, knee high,\ninvulnerable. We hit, but without apparent effect. New heads rose,\nthe press behind increased. We gave ground. We staggered, struggling\ndesperately to keep our feet.\n\nHow long this lasted I cannot tell. It seemed hours. I know my arms\nbecame leaden from swinging my club; my eyes were full of sweat; my\nbreath gasped. A sharp pain in my knee nearly doubled me to the ground\nand yet I remember clamping to the thought that I must keep my feet,\nkeep my feet at any cost. Then all at once I recalled the fact that\nI was armed. I jerked out the short-barrelled Colt's 45 and turned\nit loose in their faces.\n\nWhether the flash and detonation frightened them; whether Perdosa,\nstill clinging to his rock, managed to turn their attention by his\nflanking efforts, or whether, quite simply, the wall of dead finally\nturned them back, I do not know, but with one accord they gave over\nthe attempt.\n\nI looked at once for Handy Solomon, and was surprised to see him still\nalive, standing upright on a ledge the other side of the herd. His\nclothing was literally torn to shreds, and he was covered with blood.\nBut in this plight he was not alone, for when I turned toward my\ncompanions they, too, were tattered, torn, and gory. We were a\ndreadful crew, standing there in the half-light, our chests heaving,\nour rags dripping red.\n\nFor perhaps ten seconds no one moved. Then with a yell of demoniac\nrage my companions clambered over the rampart of dead seals and\nattacked the herd.\n\nThe seals were now cowed and defenceless. It was a slaughter, and the\nmost debauching and brutal I have ever known. I had hit out with the\nrest when it had been a question of defence, but from this I turned\naside in a sick loathing. The men seemed possessed of devils, and of\ntheir unnatural energy. Perdosa cast aside the club and took to his\nnatural weapon, the knife.\n\nI can see him yet rolling over and over embracing a big cow, his head\njammed in an ecstasy of ferocity between the animal's front flippers,\nhis legs clasped to hold her body, only his right arm rising and\nfalling as he plunged his knife again and again. She struggled,\nturning him over and under, wept great tears, and fairly whined with\nterror and pain. Finally she was still, and Perdosa staggered to his\nfeet, only to stare about him drunkenly for a moment before throwing\nhimself with a screech on another victim.\n\nThe <DW65> alone did not jump into the turmoil. He stood just down\nthe cave, his club ready. Occasionally a disorganised rush to escape\nwould be made. The <DW65>'s lips snarled, and with a truly mad enjoyment\nhe beat the poor animals back.\n\nI pressed against the wall horrified, fascinated, unable either to\ninterfere or to leave. A close, sticky smell took possession of the\nair. After a little a tiny stream, growing each moment, began to flow\npast my feet. It sought its channel daintily, as streamlets do,\nfeeling among the stones in eddies, quiet pools, miniature falls, and\nrapids. For the moment I did not realise what it could be. Then the\nlight caught it down where the <DW65> waited, and I saw it was red.\n\nAt first the racket of the seals was overpowering. Now, gradually,\nit was losing volume. I began to hear the blasphemies, ferocious cries,\nscreams of anger hurled against the cave walls by the men. The thick,\nsticky smell grew stronger; the light seemed to grow dimmer, as though\nit could not burn in that fetid air. A seal came and looked up at me,\nbig tears rolling from her eyes; then she flippered aimlessly away,\nout of her poor wits with terror. The sight finished me. I staggered\ndown the length of the black tunnel to the boat.\n\nAfter a long interval a little three months' pup waddled down to the\nwater's edge, caught sight of me, and with a squeal of fright dived\nfar. Poor little devil! I would not have hurt him for worlds. As far\nas I know this was the only survivor of all that herd.\n\nThe men soon appeared, one by one, tired, sleepy-eyed, glutted,\nwalking in a cat-like trance of satiety. They were blood and tatters\nfrom head to foot, and from drying red masks peered their bloodshot\neyes. Not a word said they, but tumbled into the boat, pushed off,\nand in a moment we were floating in the full sunshine again. We rowed\nhome in an abstraction. For the moment Berserker rage had burned itself\nout. Handy Solomon continually wetted his lips, like an animal licking\nits chops. Thrackles stared into space through eyes drugged with\nkilling. No one spoke.\n\nWe landed in the cove, and were surprised to find it in shadow. The\nafternoon was far advanced. Over the hill we dragged ourselves, and\ndown to the spring. There the men threw themselves flat and drank in\ngreat gulps until they could drink no more. We built a fire, but the\n<DW65> refused to cook.\n\n\"Someone else turn,\" he growled, \"I cook aboard ship.\"\n\nPerdosa, who had hewed the fuel, at once became angry.\n\n\"I cut heem de wood!\" he said, \"I do my share; eef I cut heem de wood\nyou mus' cook heem de grub!\"\n\nBut the <DW65> shook his head, and Perdosa went into an ecstasy of\nrage. He kicked the fire to pieces; he scattered the unburned wood\nup and down the beach; he even threw some of it into the sea.\n\n\"Eef you no cook heem de grub, you no hab my wood!\" he shrieked, with\nenough oaths to sink his soul.\n\nFinally Pulz interfered.\n\n\"Here you damn foreigners,\" said he, \"quit it! Let up, I say! We got\nto eat. You let that wood alone, or you'll pick it up again!\"\n\nPerdosa sprang at him with a screech. Pulz was small but nimble, and\nunderstood rough and tumble fighting. He met Perdosa's rush with two\nswift blows--a short arm jab and an upper-cut. Then they clinched,\nand in a moment were rolling over and over just beyond the wash of\nthe surf.\n\nThe row waked the <DW65> from his sullen abstraction. He seemed to\ncome to himself with a start; his eye fell surprisedly on the\ncombatants, then lit up with an unholy joy. He drew his knife and\ncrept down on the fighters. It was too good an opportunity to pay off\nthe Mexican.\n\nBut Thrackles interfered sharply.\n\n\"Come off!\" he commanded. \"None o' that!\"\n\n\"Go to hell!\" growled the <DW65>.\n\nA great rage fell on them all, blind and terrible, like that leading\nto the slaughter of the seals. They fought indiscriminately, hitting\nat each other with fists and knives. It was difficult to tell who was\nagainst whom. The sound of heavy breathing, dull blows, the tear of\ncloth; and grunts of punishment received; the swirl of the sand, the\nheave of struggling bodies, all riveted my attention, so that I did\nnot see Captain Ezra Selover until he stood almost at my elbow.\n\"Stop!\" he shrieked in his high, falsetto voice.\n\nAnd would you believe it, even through the blood haze of their combat\nthe men heard him, and heeded. They drew reluctantly apart, got to\ntheir feet, stood looking at him through reeking brows half submissive\nand half defiant. The bull-headed Thrackles even took a half step\nforward, but froze in his tracks when Old Scrubs looked at him.\n\n\"I hire you men to fight when I tell you to, and only then,\" said the\ncaptain sternly. \"What does this mean?\"\n\nHe menaced them one after another with his eyes, and one after another\nthey quailed. All their plottings, their threats, their dangerousness\ndissipated like mist before the command of this one resolute man.\nThese pirates who had seemed so dreadful to me, now were nothing more\nthan cringing schoolboys before their master.\n\nAnd then suddenly to my horror I, watching closely, saw the captain's\neye turn blank. I am sure the men must have felt the change, though\ncertainly they were too far away to see it, for they shifted by ever\nso little from their first frozen attitude. The captain's hand sought\nhis pocket, and they froze again, but instead of the expected\nrevolver, he produced a half-full brandy bottle.\n\nThe change in his eyes had crept into his features. They had turned\nfoolishly amiable, vacant, confiding.\n\n\"'llo boys,\" said he appealingly, \"you good fellowsh, ain't you? Have\na drink. 'S good stuff. Good ol' bottl',\" he lurched, caught himself,\nand advanced toward them, still with the empty smile.\n\nThey stared at him for ten seconds, quite at a loss. Then:\n\n\"By God, he's drunk!\" Handy Solomon breathed, scarcely louder than\na whisper.\n\nThere was no other signal given. They sprang as with a single impulse.\nOne instant I saw clear against the waning daylight the bulky,\nfoolish-swaying form of Captain Selover: the next it had disappeared,\ncarried down and obliterated by the rush of attacking bodies. Knives\ngleamed ruddy in the sunset. There was no struggle. I heard a deep\ngroan. Then the murderers rose slowly to their feet.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nI MAKE MY ESCAPE\n\n\nI had plenty of time to run away. I do not know why I did not do so;\nbut the fact stands that I remained where I was until they had\nfinished Captain Selover. Then I took to my heels, but was soon\ncornered. I drew my revolver, remembered that I had emptied it in the\nseal cave--and had time for no more coherent mental processes. A\nsmothering weight flung itself on me, against which I struggled as\nhard as I could, shrinking in anticipation from the thirsty plunge\nof the knives. However, though the weight increased until further\nstruggle was impossible, I was not harmed, and in a few moments found\nmyself, wrists and ankles tied, beside a roaring fire. While I\ncollected myself I heard the grate of a boat being shoved off from\nthe cove, and a few moments later made out lights aboard the _Laughing\nLass_.\n\nThe looting party returned very shortly. Their plundering had gone\nonly as far as liquor and arms. Thrackles let down from the cliff top\na keg at the end of a line. Perdosa and the <DW65> each carried an\narmful of the 30-40 rifles. The keg was rolled to the fire and\nbroached.\n\nThe men got drunk, wildly drunk, but not helplessly so. A flame\ncommunicated itself to them through the liquor. The ordinary\ncharacteristics of their composition sprung into sharper relief. The\n<DW65> became more sullen; Perdosa more snake-like; Pulz more\nviciously evil; Thrackles more brutal; while Handy Solomon staggering\nfrom his seat to the open keg and back again, roaring fragments of\na chanty, his red headgear contrasting with his smoky black hair and\nhis swarthy hook-nosed countenance--he needed no further touch.\n\nTheir evil passions were all awake, and the plan, so long indefinite,\ndeveloped like a photographer's plate.\n\n\"That's one,\" said Thrackles. \"One gone to hell.\"\n\n\"And now the diamonds,\" muttered Pulz.\n\n  \"There's a ship upon the windward, a wreck upon the lee,\n      _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e_,\"\n\nroared Handy Solomon. \"Damn it all, boys, it's the best night's work\nwe ever did. The stuff's ours. Then it's me for a big stone house in\nFrisco O!\"\n\n\"Frisco, hell,\" sneered Pulz, \"that's all you know. You ought to\ntravel. Paris for me and a little gal to learn the language from.\"\n\n\"I get heem a fine _caballo_, an' fine saddle, an' fine clo's,\"\nbreathed Perdosa sentimentally. \"I ride, and the silver jingle, and\nthe _senorita_ look----\"\n\nThrackles was for a ship and the China trade.\n\n\"What you want, Doctor?\" they demanded of the silent <DW65>.\n\nBut the <DW65> only rolled his eyes and shook his head. By and by he\narose and disappeared in the dusk and was no more seen.\n\n\"Dam' fool,\" muttered Handy Solomon. \"Well, here's to crime!\"\n\nHe drank a deep cup of the raw rum, and staggered back to his seat\non the sands.\n\n  \"'I am not a man-o'-war, nor a privateer,' said he.\n      _Blow high, blow low! What care we_!\n  'But I am a jolly pirate and I'm sailing for my fee,'\n      _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e_.\"\n\nhe sang. \"We'll land in Valparaiso and we'll go every man his way;\nand we'll sink the old _Laughing Lass_ so deep the mermaids can't\nfind her.\"\n\nThrackles piled on more wood and the fire leaped high.\n\n\"Let's get after 'em,' said he.\n\n\"To-morrow's jes' 's good,\" muttered Pulz. \"Les' hav' 'nother drink.\"\n\n\"We'll stay here 'n see if our ol' frien' Percy don' show up,\" said\nHandy Solomon. He threw back his head and roared forth a volume of\nsound toward the dim stars.\n\n  \"Broadside to broadside the gallant ships did lay,\n      _Blow high, blow low! What care we_?\n  'Til the jolly man-o'-war shot the pirate's mast away,\n      _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e_.\"\n\nI saw near me a live coal dislodged from the fire when Thrackles had\nthrown on the armful of wood. An idea came to me. I hitched myself\nto the spark, and laid across it the rope with which my wrists were\ntied. This, behind my back, was not easy to accomplish, and twice I\nburned my wrists before I succeeded.\n\nFortunately I was at the edge of illumination, and behind the group.\nI turned over on my side so that my back was toward the fire. Then\nrapidly I cast loose my ankle lashings. Thus I was free, and selecting\na moment when universal attention was turned toward the rum barrel,\nI rolled over a sand dune, got to my hands and knees, and crept away.\n\nThrough the coarse grass I crept thus, to the very entrance of the\narroyo, then rose to my feet. In the middle distance the fire leaped\nred. Its glow fell intermittently on the surges rolling in. The men\nstaggered or lay prone, either as gigantic silhouettes or as\ntatterdemalions painted by the light. The keg stood solid and\nsubstantial, the hub about which reeled the orgy. At the edge of the\nwash I could make out something prone, dim, limp, thrown constantly\nin new positions of weariness as the water ebbed and flowed beneath\nit, now an arm thrown out, now cast back, as though Old Scrubs slept\nfeverishly. The drunkards were getting noisy. Handy Solomon still\nreeled off the verses of, his song. The others joined in, frightfully\noff the key; or punctuated the performance by wild staccato yells.\n\n  \"Their coffin was their ship and their grave it was the sea,\n      _Blow high, blow low! What care we_?\n  And the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea,\n      _Down on the coast of the high Barbare-e-e,_\"\n\nbellowed Handy Solomon.\n\nI turned and plunged into the cool darkness of the canon.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nAN ADVENTURE IN THE NIGHT\n\n\nTen seconds after entering the arroyo I was stumbling along in an\nabsolute blackness. It almost seemed to me that I could reach out my\nhands and touch it, as one would touch a wall. Or perhaps not exactly\nthat, for a wall is hard, and this darkness was soft and yielding,\nin the manner of enveloping hangings. Directly above me was a narrow,\njagged, and irregular strip of sky with stars. I splashed in the\nbrook, finding its waters strangely warm, rustled through the grasses,\nmy head back, chin out, hands extended as one makes his way through\na house at night. There were no sounds except the tinkle of the\nsulphurous stream: successive bends in the canon wall had shut off\neven the faintest echoes of the bacchanalia on the beach.\n\nThe way seemed much longer than by daylight. Already in my calculation\nI had traversed many times the distance, when, with a jump at the\nheart, I made out a glow ahead, and in front of it the upright logs\nof the stockade.\n\nTo my surprise the gate was open. I ascended the gentle <DW72> to the\nvalley's level--and stumbled over a man lying prostrate, shivering\nviolently, and moaning.\n\nI bent over to discover whom it might be. As I did so a brilliant\nlight seemed to fill the valley, throwing an illumination on the man\nat my feet. I saw it was the <DW65>, and perceived at the same instant\nthat he was almost beside himself with terror. His eyes rolled, his\nteeth chattered, his frame contracted in a strong convulsion, and the\nblack of his complexion had faded to a washed-out dirty grey,\nrevolting to contemplate. He felt my touch and sprang to his feet,\nclutching me by the shoulder as a man clutching rescue.\n\n\"My Gawd!\" he shivered. \"Look! Dar it is again!\"\n\nHe fell to pattering in a tongue unknown to me--charms, spells,\nundoubtedly, to exorcise the devils that had hold of him. I followed\nthe direction of his gaze, and myself cried out.\n\nThe doctor's laboratory stood in plain sight between the two columns\nof steam blown straight upward through the stillness of the evening.\nIt seemed bursting with light. Every little crack leaked it in\ngenerous streams, while the main illumination appeared fairly to bulge\nthe walls outward. This was in itself nothing extraordinary, and\nindicated only the activity of those within, but while I looked an\nirregular patch of incandescence suddenly splashed the cliff opposite.\nFor a single instant the very substance of the rock glowed white hot;\nthen from the spot a shower of spiteful flakes shot as from a\npyrotechnic, and the light was blotted out as suddenly as it came.\nAt the same moment it appeared at another point, exhibited the same\nphenomena, died, flashed out at still a third place, and so was\nrepeated here and there with bewildering rapidity until the walls of\nthe valley crackled and spat sparks. Abruptly the darkness fell.\n\nAs abruptly it was broken again by a similar exhibition; only this\ntime the fire was blue. Blue was followed by purple, purple by red.\nThen ensued the briefest possible pause, in which a figure moved\nacross the bars of light escaping through the chinks of the\nlaboratory, and then the whole valley blazed with patches of\nvari- fire. It was not a reflection: it was actual physical\nconflagration of the solid rock, in irregular areas. Some of the fire\nshapes were most fantastic. And with the unexpectedness of a bursting\nshell the surface of the ground before our feet crackled into a\nghastly blue flame.\n\nThe <DW65> uttered a cry in his throat and disappeared. I felt a sharp\nbreath on my neck, an ejaculation of surprise at my very ear. It was\nstartling enough to scare the soul out of a man, but I held fast and\nwas just about to step forward, when my collar was twisted tight from\nbehind. I raised both hands, felt steel, and knew that I was in the\ngrasp of Handy Solomon's claw.\n\nThe sailor had me foul. I did my best to twist around, to unbutton\nthe collar, but in vain. I felt my wind leaving me, the ghastly blue\nlight was shot with red. Distinctly I heard the man's sharp intaken\nbreath as some new phenomenon met his eye, and his great oath as he\nswore. \"By the mother of God!\" he cried, \"it's the devil.\"\n\nThen I was jerked off my feet, and the next I knew I was lying on my\nback, very wet, on the beach; the day was breaking, and the men, quite\nsober, were talking vehemently.\n\nIt was impossible to make out what they said, but as Handy Solomon\nand the <DW65> were the centre of discussion, I could imagine the subject.\nI felt very stiff and sore and hazy in my mind. My neck was lame from\nthe dragging and my tongue dry from the choking. For some time I lay\nin a half-torpor watching the lilac of dawn change to the rose of\nsunrise, utterly indifferent to everything. They had thrown me down\nacross the first rise of the little sand dunes back of the tide sands,\nand from it I could at once look out over the sea full of the restless\nshadows of dawn, and the land narrowing to the mouth of the arroyo.\nI remember wondering whether Captain Selover were up yet. Then with\na sharp stab at the heart I remembered.\n\nThe thought was like a dash of cold water in clearing my faculties.\nI raised my head. Seaward a white gull had caught the first rays of\nthe sun beyond the cliffs. Landward--I saw with a choke in my throat--a\nfigure emerging from the arroyo.\n\nAt the sight I made a desperate attempt to move, but with the effort\ndiscovered that I was again bound. My stirring thus called Pulz's\nattention. Before I could look away he had followed the direction of\nmy gaze. The discussion instantly ceased. They waited in grim silence.\n\nI did not know what to do. Percy Darrow, carrying some sort of large\nbook, was walking rapidly toward us. Perdosa had disappeared.\nThrackles after an instant came and sat beside me and clapped his big\nhand over my mouth. It was horrible.\n\nWhen within a hundred paces or so, I could see that Darrow laboured\nunder some great excitement. His usual indifferent saunter had, as\nI have indicated, given way to a firm and decided step; his ironical\neye glistened; his sallow cheek glowed.\n\n\"Boys,\" he shouted cheerfully. \"The time's up. We've succeeded. We'll\nsail just as soon as the Lord'll let us get ready. Rustle the stuff\naboard. The doctor'll be down in a short time, and we ought to be\nloaded by night.\"\n\nHandy Solomon and Pulz laid hand on two of the rifles near by and\nbegan surreptitiously to fill their magazines. The <DW65> shook his\nknife free of the scabbard and sat with it in his left hand, concealed\nby his body. I could feel Thrackles's muscles stiffen. Another fifty\npaces and it would be no longer necessary to stop my mouth.\n\nThe thought made me desperate. I had failed as a leader of these men,\nand I had been forced to stand by at debauching, cruel, and murderous\naffairs, but now it is over I thank Heaven the reproach cannot be made\nagainst me that at any time I counted the consequences to myself.\nThrackles's hand lay heavy across my mouth. I bit it to the bone, and\nas he involuntarily snatched it away, I rolled over toward the sea.\n\nThus for an instant I had my mouth free. \"Run! Run!\" I shouted. \"For\nGod's sake----\"\n\nThrackles leaped upon me and struck me heavily upon the mouth, then\nsprang for a rifle. I managed to struggle back to the dune, whence\nI could see.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nFIVE HUNDRED YARDS' RANGE\n\n\nPercy Darrow, with the keenness that always characterised his mental\napprehension, had understood enough of my strangled cry. He had not\nhesitated nor delayed for an explanation, but had turned track and\nwas now running as fast as his long legs would carry him back toward\nthe opening of the ravine. My companions stood watching him, but making\nno attempt either to shoot or to follow. For a moment I could not\nunderstand this, then remembered the disappearance of Perdosa. My\nheart jumped wildly, for the Mexican had been gone quite long enough\nto have cut off the assistant's escape. I could not doubt that he\nwould pick off his man at close range as soon as the fugitive should\nhave reached the entrance to the arroyo.\n\nThere can be no question that he would have done so had not his\nMexican impatience betrayed him. He shot too soon. Percy Darrow\nstopped in his tracks. Although we heard the bullet sing by us, for\nan instant we thought he was hit. Then Perdosa fired a second time,\nagain without result. Darrow turned sharp to the left and began desperately\nto scale the steep cliffs.\n\nI once took part in a wild boar hunt on the coast of California. Our\ndogs had penned a small band at the head of a narrow _barranca_,\nfrom which a single steep trail led over the hill. We, perched on\nanother hill some three or four hundred yards away, shot at the\nanimals as they toiled up the trail. The range was long, but we had\ntime, for the severity of the climb forced the boars to a foot pace.\n\nIt was exactly like that. Percy Darrow had two hundred feet of ascent\nto make. He could go just so fast; must consume just so much time in\nhis snail-like progress up the face of the hill. During that time he\nfurnished an excellent target, and the loose sandstone showed where\neach shot struck.\n\nA significant indication was that the men did not take the trouble\nto get nearer, for which manoeuvre they would have had time in plenty,\nbut distributed themselves leisurely for a shooting match.\n\n\"First shot,\" claimed Handy Solomon, and without delay fired off-hand.\nA puff of dust showed to the right. \"Nerve no good,\" he commented,\n\"jerked her just as I pulled.\"\n\nPulz fired from the knee. The dust this time puffed below.\n\n\"Thought she'd carry up at that distance,\" he muttered.\n\nThe <DW65>, too, missed, and Thrackles grinned triumphantly.\n\n\"I get a show,\" said he. He spread his massive legs apart, drew a deep\nbreath, and raised his weapon. It lay in his grasp steady as a log,\nand I saw that Percy Darrow's fate was in the hands of that dangerous\nclass of natural marksman that possesses no nerves. But for the second\ntime my teeth saved his life. The trigger guard slipped against\nThrackles's lacerated hand almost at the instant of discharge. He\nmissed; and the bullet went wide.\n\nDarrow had climbed a matter of twenty feet.\n\nNow the seamen distributed themselves for more leisurely and accurate\nmarksmanship. Handy Solomon lay flat on his stomach, resting the rifle\nmuzzle across the top of a sand dune. Pulz sat down, an elbow on\neither knee for the greater steadiness. The <DW65> knelt; but\nThrackles remained on his feet. No rest could be steadier than the\nstone-like rigidity of his thick arms.\n\nThe firing now became miscellaneous. No one paid any attention to\nanyone else. Each discovered what I could have told them, that even\nthe human figure at five hundred yards is a small mark for a strange\nrifle. The constant correction of elevation, however, brought the\npuffs of dust always closer, and I could not but realise that the\ndoctrine of chances must bring home some of the bullets. I soon\ndiscovered by way of comfort that only Thrackles and Handy Solomon\nreally understood firearms; and of those two Thrackles alone had had\nmuch experience at long range. He told me afterward he had hunted\notter.\n\nAbout halfway up the cliff Thrackles fired his fifth shot. No dust\nfollowed the discharge; and I saw Percy Darrow stagger and almost lose\nhis hold. The men yelled savagely, but the assistant pulled himself\ntogether and continued his crawling.\n\nThe sun had been shining in our faces. I could imagine its blurring\neffect on the sights. Now abruptly it was blotted out, and a\nsemi-twilight fell. We all looked up, in spite of ourselves. An opaque\nveil had been drawn quite across the heavens, through which we could\nnot make out even the shape of the sun. It was like a thunder cloud\nexcept that its under surface instead of being the usual grey-black\nwas a deep earth-brown. As we looked up, a deep bellow stirred the air,\nwhich had fallen quite still, long forks of lightning shot\nhorizontally from the direction of the island's interior, and flashes\nof dull red were reflected from the canopy of cloud.\n\nThe men stared with their mouths open. Undoubtedly the change had been\nsome time in preparation, but all had been so absorbed in the affair\nof the doctor's assistant that no one had noticed. It came to our\nconsciousness with the suddenness of a theatrical change. A dull\nroaring commenced, grew in volume, and then a great explosion shook\nthe very ground under our feet.\n\nWe stared at each other, our faces whitening.\n\n\"What kind of hell has broke loose?\" muttered Pulz.\n\nThe <DW65> fell flat on his face, uttering deep lamentations.\n\n\"Voodoo! Voodoo!\" he groaned.\n\nA gentle shower of white flakes began, powdering the surface of\neverything. Far out to sea we could make out the sun on the water.\nGradually the roaring died down; the lightning ceased. Comparative\npeace ensued. We looked again toward the cliff. Percy Darrow had not\nfor one instant ceased to climb. He was just topping the edge of the\nbluff. Handy Solomon, with a cry of rage, seized another rifle and\nemptied the magazine at him as fast as the lever could be worked. The\ndust flew wild in a half dozen places. Darrow drew himself up to the\nsky line, raised his hat ironically, and disappeared.\n\n[Illustration: The firing now became miscellaneous. No one paid any\nattention to any one else.]\n\n\"Damn his soul!\" cried Handy Solomon, his face livid. He threw his\nrifle to the beach and danced on it in an ecstasy of rage.\n\n\"What do we care,\" growled Thrackles, \"he's no good to us. W'at I want\nto know is, wat's up here, anyhow!\"\n\n\"Didn't you never see a volcano go off, you swab?\" snapped Handy\nSolomon.\n\n\"Easy with your names, mate. No, I never did. We better get out.\"\n\n\"Without the chest?\"\n\n\"S'pose we go up the gulch and get it, then,\" suggested Thrackles.\n\nBut at this Handy Solomon drew back in evident terror.\n\n\"Up that hole of hell?\" he objected. \"Not I. You an' Pulz go.\"\n\nThey wrangled over it, Pulz joining. Perdosa, shaken to the soul,\ncrept in, and made a bee-line for the rum barrel. He and the <DW65>\nwere frankly scared. They had the nervous jumps at every little noise\nor unexpected movement; and even the natural explanation of these\nphenomena gave them very little reassurance. I knew that Darrow would\nhurry as fast as he could back to the valley by way of the upper\nhills; I knew that he had there several sporting rifles; and I hoped\ngreatly that he and Dr. Schermerhorn might accomplish something before\nthe men had recovered their wits to the point of foreseeing his\nprobable attack. The uncanny cloud in the heavens, the weird\nhalf-light, and the explosions, which now grew more frequent, had\ntheir strong effect in spite of explanation. The men were not really\nafraid to venture in quest of the supposed treasure; but they were in\na frame of mind that dreaded the first plunge. And time was going by.\n\nBut the fates were against us, as always in this ill-starred voyage.\nI, watching from my sand dune, saw a second figure emerge from the\narroyo's mouth. It appeared to stagger as though hurt; and every eight\nor ten paces it stopped and rested in a bent-over position. The murky\nlight was too dim for me to make out details; but after a moment a\nrift in the veil enabled me to identify Dr. Schermerhorn carrying,\nwith great difficulty, the chest.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nTHE MURDER\n\n\nI took no chances, but began at once to shout, as soon as I saw the men\nhad noticed his coming. It was impossible for me to tell whether or not\nDr. Schermerhorn heard me. If he did, he misunderstood my intention, for\nhe continued painfully to advance. The only result I gained was to get\nmyself well gagged with my own pocket handkerchief, and thrown in a hollow\nbetween the dunes. Thence I could hear Handy Solomon speaking fiercely and\nrapidly.\n\n\"Now you let me run this,\" he commanded; \"we got to find out somethin'. It\nain't no good to us without we knows--and we want to find out how he's got\nthe rest hid.\"\n\nThey assented.\n\n\"I'm goin' out to help him carry her in,\" announced the seaman.\n\nA long pause ensued, in which I watched the deep canopy of red-black\nthicken overhead. A strange and unearthly light had fallen on the world,\nand the air was quite still. After a while I heard Handy Solomon and Dr.\nSchermerhorn join the group.\n\n\"There you are, Perfessor,\" cried Handy Solomon, in tones of the greatest\nheartiness, \"I'll put her right there, and she'll be as safe as a babby at\nhome. She's heavy, though.\"\n\nDr. Schermerhorn laughed a pleased and excited laugh. I could tell by the\ntone of his voice that he was strung high, and guessed that his triumph\nneeded an audience.\n\n\"You may say so well!\" he said. \"It iss heafy; and it iss heafy with the\nworld-desire, the great substance than can do efferything. Where iss\nPercy?\"\n\n\"He's gone aboard.\"\n\n\"We must embark. The time is joost right. A day sooner and the egsperiment\nwould haf been spoilt; but now\"--he laughed--\"let the island sink, we do\nnot care. We must embark hastily.\"\n\n\"It'll take a man long time to carry down all your things, Perfessor.\"\n\n\"Oh, led them go! The eruption has alretty swallowed them oop. The lava\niss by now a foot deep in the valley. Before long it flows here, so we\nmust embark.\"\n\n\"But you've lost all them vallyable things, Perfessor,\" said Handy\nSolomon. \"Now, I call that hard luck.\"\n\nDr. Schermerhorn snapped his fingers.\n\n\"They do not amoundt to that!\" he cried. \"Here, here, in this leetle box\niss all the treasure! Here iss the labour of ten years! Here iss the\n_Laughing Lass_, and the crew, and all the equipmendt comprised. Here iss\nthe world!\"\n\n\"I'm a plain seaman, Perfessor, and I suppose I got to believe you; but\nshe's a main small box for all that.\"\n\n\"With that small box you can haf all your wishes,\" asserted the Professor,\nstill in the German lyric strain over his triumph. \"It iss the box of\nenchantments. You haf but to will the change you would haf <DW9> place--it\niss done. The substance of the rocks, the molecule--all!\"\n\n\"Could a man make diamonds?\" asked Pulz abruptly. I could hear the sharp\nintake of the men's breathing as they hung on the reply.\n\n\"Much more wonderful changes than that it can accomplish,\" replied the\ndoctor, with an indulgent laugh. \"That change iss simple. Carbon iss coal;\ncarbon iss diamond. You see? One has but to change the form, not the\nsubstance.\"\n\n\"Then it'll change coal to diamonds?\" asked Handy Solomon.\n\n\"Yes, you gather my meanings--\"\n\nI heard a sharp squeak like a terrified mouse. Then a long, dreadful\nsilence; then two dull, heavy blows, spaced with deliberation. A moment\nlater I caught a glimpse of Handy Solomon bent forward to the labour of\ndragging a body toward the sea, his steel claw hooked under the angle of\nthe jaw as a man handles a fish. Pulz came and threw off my bonds and gag.\n\n\"Come along!\" said he.\n\nAll kept looking fearfully toward the arroyo. A dense white steam marked\nits course. The air was now heavy with portent. Successive explosions,\nsome light, some severe, shook the foundations of the island. Great rocks\nand boulders bounded down the hills. The flashes of lightning had become\nmore frequent. We moved, exaggerated to each other's vision by the strange\nlight, uncouth and gigantic.\n\n\"Let's get out of this!\" cried Thrackles.\n\nWe turned at the word and ran, Thrackles staggering under the weight of\nthe chest. All our belongings we abandoned, and set out for the _Laughing\nLass_ with only the tatters in which we stood. Luckily for us a great part\nof the ship's stores had been returned to her hold after the last thorough\nscrubbing, so we were in subsistence, but all our clothes, all our\npersonal belongings, were left behind us on the beach. For after once we\nhad topped the cliff that led over to the cove, I doubt if any\nconsideration on earth would have induced us to return to that accursed\nplace.\n\nThe row out to the ship was wet and dangerous. Seismic disturbances were\nundoubtedly responsible for high pyramidic waves that lifted and fell\nwithout onward movement. We fairly tumbled up out of the dory, which we\ndid not hoist on deck, but left at the end of the painter to beat her\nsides against the ship.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nTHE OPEN SEA\n\n\nOur haste, however, availed us little, for there was no wind at all. We\nlay for over two hours under the weird light, over-canopied by the red-\nbrown cloud, while the explosions shook the foundations of the world.\nNobody ventured below. The sails flapped idly from the masts: the blocks\nand spars creaked: the three-cornered waves rose straight up and fell\nagain as though reaching from the deep.\n\nWhen the men first began to sweat the sails up, evidently in preparation\nfor an immediate departure, I objected vehemently.\n\n\"You aren't going to leave him on the island,\" I cried. \"He'll die of\nstarvation.\"\n\nThey did not answer me; but after a little more, when my expostulations\nhad become more positive, Handy Solomon dropped the halliard, and drew me\nto one side.\n\n\"Look here, you,\" he snarled, \"you'd better just stow your gab. You're\nlucky to be here yourself, let alone botherin' your thick head about\nanybody else, and you can kiss the Book on that! Do you know why you ain't\nwith them carrion?\" He jerked his thumb toward the beach. \"It's because\nSolomon Anderson's your friend. Thrackles would have killed you in a\nminute 'count of his bit hand. I got you your chance. Now don't you be a\nfool, for I ain't goin' to stand between you and them another time.\nBesides, he won't last long if that volcano keeps at it.\"\n\nHe left me. Whatever truth lay in his assumption of friendship, and I\ndoubted there existed much of either truth or friendship in him, I saw the\ncommon sense of his advice. I was in no position to dictate a course of\naction.\n\nAfter the sails were on her we gathered at the starboard rail to watch the\nshore. There the hills ran into inky blackness, as the horizon sometimes\nmerges into a thunder squall. A dense white steam came from the creek bed\nwithin the arroyo. The surges beat on the shore louder than the ordinary,\nand the foam, even in these day hours, seemed to throw up a faint\nphosphorescence. Frequent earthquakes oscillated the landscape. We\nwatched, I do not know for what, our eyes straining into the murk of the\nisland. Nobody thought of the chest, which lay on the cabin table aft. I\ncontributed maliciously my bit to their fear.\n\n\"These volcanic islands sometimes sink entirely,\" I suggested, \"and in\nthat case we'd be carried down by the suction.\"\n\nIt was intended merely to increase their uneasiness, but, strangely\nenough, after a few moments it ended by imposing itself on my own fears. I\nbegan to be afraid the island would sink, began to watch for it, began to\nshare the fascinated terror of these men.\n\nThe suspense after a time became unbearable, for while the portent--\nwhether physical or moral we were too far under its influence to\ndistinguish--grew momentarily, our own souls did not expand in due\ncorrespondence. We talked of towing, of kedging out, of going to any\nextreme, even to small boats. Then just as we were about to move toward\nsome accomplishment, a new phenomenon chained our attention to the shore.\n\nIn the mouth of the arroyo appeared a red glow. A moment later a wave of\nlava, white-hot, red, iridescent, cooling to a black crust cracked in\nincandescence, rolled majestically out over the grassy plain. Each instant\nit grew in volume, until the ravine must have been flowing half full.\n\nBefore its scorching the grasses even at the edge of the sea were smoking,\nand our camp had already burst into flames. We had to shield our faces\nagainst the heat, and the wooden railing under our hands was growing warm.\n\nPulz turned an ashy countenance toward us.\n\n\"My God,\" he screamed. \"What's going to happen when she hits the sea?\"\n\nShe hit the sea, and immediately a great cloud of steam arose, and the\nhissing as of a thousand serpents. We felt the strong suction under our\nkeel, and staggered under the jerk of the ship's cable as she swung toward\nthe beach. The paint was beginning to crackle along the rail. We could see\nnothing for the scalding white veil that enveloped us; we could hear\nnothing for the roar of steam, the bombardment of explosions, and the\ncrash of thunder; but our nostrils were assaulted by a most unearthly\nmedley of smells.\n\n\"Hell's loose,\" growled Thrackles.\n\nWe were clinging hard as the ship reeled. Huge surges were racing in from\nseaward, growing larger with each successive billow.\n\nHandy Solomon raised his head, listened intently, and struck his forehead.\n\n\"Wind,\" he screamed at the top of his voice, and jumped for the halliards.\n\nThrackles followed him, but no one else moved. In an instant the two were\nback, striking and kicking savagely, rousing their companions to the\ndanger. We all laid into the canvas like mad, and in no time had snugged\ndown to a staysail and the peak of our mainsail. Thrackles drew his knife\nand jumped for the cable, while Handy Solomon, his eyes snapping, seized\nthe wheel.\n\nWe finished just in time. I was turning away after tying the last gasket\non the foresail, when the deck up-ended and tipped me headforemost into\nthe starboard scupper. At the same time a smother of salt water blew over\nthe port rail, now far above me, to drench me as thoroughly as though I\nhad fallen overboard. I brushed out my eyes to find the ship smack on her\nbeam ends, and the wind howling by from the sea.\n\nI had company enough in the scuppers. Only Handy Solomon clung desperately\nto the wheel, jamming his weight to port in the hope she might pay up:\nThrackles, too, his eye squinted along some bearing of his own, was\nwaiting for her to drag. Presently it became evident that she was doing\nso, whereupon he drew his knife across our hawser.\n\n\"My God,\" chattered Pulz at my ear. \"If we go ashore--\"\n\nHe did not need to finish. Unless the _Laughing Lass_ could recover before\nthe squall had driven her to leeward a scant half mile, we should be\ncooked alive in the boiling cauldron at the shore's edge.\n\nFor an interminable time, as it seemed to me, we lay absolutely\nmotionless. The scene is stamped indelibly on my memory--the bulwarks high\nabove me, the steep, sleek deck, the piratical figure tense at the wheel,\nthe snarling water racing from beneath us, the lurid glow to landward\ncrawling up on us inch by inch like a hungry wild beast. Then almost\nimperceptibly the brave schooner righted. The strained lines on Handy\nSolomon's carven features relaxed little by little. Thrackles, staring\nover the side, let out a mighty roar.\n\n\"Steerage way,\" he shouted, and executed an awkward clog dance on the\nreeling deck.\n\nShe moved forward, there was no doubt of that, for gradually we were\neating toward the wind--but we made considerable leeway as well. Handy\nSolomon, taut as the weather rigging, took his little advantages one by\none like precious gifts. Light there was none; the land was blotted out by\nthe steam and murk which had crept to sea and now was hurled back by the\nwind. All we could do was to hang there, tasting the copper of excitement,\nwaiting for these different forces to adjust themselves. Inch by inch we\ncrept forward: foot by foot we made leeway. The intensest of the lava glow\nworked its way from directly abeam to the quarter. By this we knew we must\nbe nearly opposite the cove. At once a new doubt sprang up in our minds.\n\nA moment ago all the energy of our desires had gone up in the ambition to\navoid being cast on the beach. Now we saw that that was not enough. It was\nnecessary to squeeze around the point where lay the _Golden Horn_, in\norder to avoid the fate that had overtaken her. Handy Solomon yelled\nsomething at us. We could not hear, but our own knowledge told us what it\nmust be, and with one accord we turned to on the foresail. With the peak\nof it hoisted we moved a trifle faster, though the schooner lay over at a\nperilous angle. A moment later the fogs parted to show us the cliffs\nlooming startlingly near. There were the donkey engine and the works we\nhad constructed for wrecking--and there beside them, watching us\nreflectively, stood Percy Darrow.\n\nFor ten minutes we stared at him fascinated, during which time the ship\nlaboured against the staggering winds, gained and lost in its buffeting\nwith the great surges. The breakers hurling themselves in wild abandon\nagainst the rocks sent their back-wash of tumbling peaks to our very\nbilges. The few remains of the _Golden Horn_, alternately drenched and\ndraining, seemed to picture to us our inevitable end.\n\nI think we had all selected the same two points for our \"bearings,\" a rock\nand a drop of the cliff bolder than the ordinary. If the rock opened from\nthe cliff to eastward, we were lost; if it remained stationary, we were at\nleast holding our own; if it opened out to westward, we were saved. We\nwatched with a strained eagerness impossible to describe. At each\nmomentary gain or rebuff we uttered ejaculations. The <DW65> mumbled\ncharms. Every once in a while one of us would snatch a glance to leeward\nat the cruel, white waters, the whirl of eddies where the sea was beaten,\nonly to hurry back to the rock and the point of the cliff whence our\nmessage of safety or destruction was to be flung. Once I looked up. Percy\nDarrow was leaning gracefully against a stanchion, watching. His soft hat\nwas pulled over his eyes; he stroked softly his little moustache; I caught\nthe white puff of his cigarette. During the moment of my inattention\nsomething happened. A wild shout burst from the men. I whirled, and saw to\nmy great joy a strip of sky westward between the cliff and the rock. And\nat that very instant a billow larger than the ordinary rolled beneath us,\nand in the back suction of its passage I could dimly make out cruel,\ndangerous rocks lying almost under our keel.\n\nSlowly we crept away. Our progress seemed infinitesimal, and yet it was\nreal. In a while we had gained sea room; in a while more we were fairly\nunder sailing way, and the cliffs had begun to drop from our quarter. With\none accord we looked back. Percy Darrow waved his hand in an indescribably\ngraceful and ironic gesture; then turned square on his heel and sauntered\naway to the north valley, out of the course of the lava. That was the last\nI ever saw of him.\n\nAs we made our way from beneath the island, the weight of the wind seemed\nto lessen. We got the foresail on her, then a standing jib; finally little\nby little all her ordinary working canvas. Before we knew it, we were\nbowling along under a stiff breeze, and the island was dropping astern.\n\nFrom a distance it presented a truly imposing sight. The centre shot\nintermittent blasts of ruddy light; explosions, deadened by distance,\nstill reverberated strongly; the broad canopy of brown-red, split with\nlightnings, spread out like a huge umbrella. The lurid gloom that had\nenveloped us in the atmosphere apparently of a nether world had given\nplace to a twilight. Abruptly we passed from it to a sun-kissed, sparkling\nsea. The breeze blew sweet and strong; the waves ran untortured in their\nnatural long courses.\n\nAt once the men seemed to throw off the superstitious terror that had\ncowed them. Pulz and Thrackles went to bail the extra dory, alongside,\nwhich by a miracle had escaped swamping. The <DW65> disappeared in the\ngalley. Perdosa relieved Handy Solomon at the wheel; and Handy Solomon\ncame directly over to me.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nTHE CATASTROPHE\n\n\nHe approached me with a confidence that proclaimed the new leader. A brace\nof Colt's revolvers swung from his belt, the tatters of his blood-stained\ngarments hung about him.\n\n\"Well, here we are,\" he remarked.\n\nI nodded, waiting for what he had to disclose.\n\n\"And lucky for you that you're here at all, say I,\" he continued. \"And now\nthat you're here, w'at are you going to do? That's the question--w'at are\nyou going to do?\" He cocked his head sidewise and looked at me\nspeculatively as a cat might look at a rather large mouse. \"We been a\nlittle rough,\" he went on after a moment, \"and some folks is strait-laced.\nThere might be trouble. And you know a heap too much.\"\n\n\"What do you want of me?\" I demanded.\n\n\"It's just this,\" he returned briskly. \"If you'll lay us our course to San\nSalvador, we'll let you go as one of us and no questions asked.\"\n\n\"If not?\" I inquired.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"I leave it to you.\"\n\n\"There's always the sea,\" I suggested.\n\n\"And it's deep,\" he agreed.\n\nWe looked out to the horizon in a diplomatic silence. I did not know\nwhether to be angry, amused, or alarmed that the man estimated my\ncleverness so slightly. Why, the hook was barely concealed, and the bait\nof the coarsest. That I would go safe to a sight of San Salvador I did not\ndoubt: that I would never enter the harbour I was absolutely certain. The\nchoice offered me was practically whether I preferred being thrown\noverboard now or several hundred miles to southeastward.\n\nI thought rapidly. It might be possible to announce a daily false\nreckoning to the crew, to sail the ship within rowing distance of some\ncoast; and then to escape while the men believed themselves many hundred\nmiles at sea. It would take nice calculation to prevent suspicion, but as\nit was the only chance I resolved upon it immediately.\n\n\"That's all very well,\" I said firmly, \"but you can't get anywhere without\nme, and I'm not going to put in two years and then keep my mouth shut for\nnothing. I want a share in the swag--an even share with the rest of you.\"\n\n\"Oh, that'll be all right,\" he cried; \"you can have it.\"\n\nIf anything was needed to convince me of the man's sinister intentions,\nthis too ready acquiescence would have been enough. I knew him too well.\nIf he had had the slightest intention of permitting me to go free, he\nwould have bargained.\n\nThe <DW65> called us to mess. We ate in the after cabin. The chest was\nlocked and the men had as yet been unable to break into it. Pulz professed\nsome skill in locksmithing and promised to experiment later. After mess we\nwent on deck again. The island had dropped down to the horizon and showed\nas a brilliant glow under a dark canopy. I leaned over the rail looking at\nit. Below me the extra dory bumped along. The idea came to me that if I\ncould escape that night, I could row back to Percy Darrow. The two of us\ncould make shift to live on fish and shellfish and mutton. The plan\nrapidly defined itself in my brain. From the remains of the _Golden Horn_\nwe could construct some kind of a craft in which to run free to the summer\ntrades. Thus we might in time reach some one or another of the Sandwich\nIslands, whence a passing trader could take us back to civilisation. There\nwere many elements of uncertainty in the scheme, but it seemed to me less\ndesperate than trusting to the caprices of these men, especially since\nthey now had free access to the liquor stores.\n\nWhile I leaned over the rail engrossed in these thoughts, one of the black\nthunder clouds that had been gathering and dissipating over the island\nduring the entire afternoon suddenly glowed overhead with a strange white\nincandescence startlingly akin to Darrow's so-called \"devil fires.\"\nStrangely enough, this illumination, unlike the volcanic glows, appeared\nto be cast on the clouds from without rather than shot through them from\nwithin, as were the other volcanic emanations. At the same instant I\nexperienced a sharp interior revulsion of some sort, most briefly\nmomentary, but of a character that shook me from head to toe.\n\nI had no time to analyse these various impressions, however, for my\nattention was almost instantly distracted. From the cabin came the sound\nof a sharp fall, then a man cried out, and on the heels of it Pulz darted\nfrom the cabin, screaming horribly. We were all on deck, and as the little\nman rushed toward the stern Handy Solomon twisted him deftly from his\nfeet.\n\n\"My God, mate, what is it?\" he cried, as he pinned the sufferer to the\ndeck.\n\nBut Pulz could not answer. He shivered, stiffened, and lay rigid, his eyes\nrolled back.\n\n\"Fits,\" remarked Thrackles impatiently.\n\nThe excitement died. Rum was forced between the victim's lips. After a\nlittle he recovered, but could tell us nothing of his seizure.\n\nAfter the dishes had been swept aside from supper, Handy Solomon announced\na second attempt to open the chest.\n\n\"Pancho, here, says he's been a mechanic,\" said he. \"I right well know\nhe's been a housebreaker. So he's got the _sabe_ for the job, and you can\nkiss the Book on that.\"\n\nPerdosa, with a grin, leaned over the cover from behind and began to pick\naway at the lock with a long, crooked wire. The others drew close about. I\nslipped nearer the door, imagining that in their riveted interest I saw my\nopportunity. To my surprise I caught a glimpse of legs disappearing up the\ncompanion. I took stock. Pulz had gone on deck.\n\nThis surprised me, for I should have thought every man interested enough\nin the supposed treasure to wish to be present at its uncovering; and it\nannoyed me still more--the success of my plan demanded a clear deck.\nHowever, there was nothing for it now but to trust that Pulz had wished to\nvisit the forecastle, and that I might find the afterworks empty.\n\nI paused at the foot of the companion and looked back. A breathlessness of\nexcitement held the pirates in a vise. From above, the hanging lamp threw\nstrong shadows across their faces, bringing out the deep lines,\naccentuating the dominant passions. With their rags and blood, their\nunshaven faces, their firearms, their filth, they showed in violent\nantithesis to the immaculate white of Old Scrubs's cabin, its glittering\nbrass, and its shining leather. I darted up the steps.\n\nThe contrast of the starry night with the glare of the cabin lamp dazzled\nmy eyes. I stood stock still for a moment, during which the only sounds\naudible were the singing of the winds through the rigging, the wash of the\nsea, and the small, sharp click of Perdosa's instrument as he worked at\nthe chest.\n\nPresently I could see better. I looked forward and aft for Pulz, but could\nsee nothing of him, and had just about concluded that he had gone forward\nwhen I happened to glance aloft. There, to my astonishment, I made him\nout, huddled in silhouette against the stars, close to the main truck.\nWhat he was doing there I could not imagine. However, I did not have time\nto bother my head about him, further than to rejoice that he could not\nobstruct me.\n\nI should very much have liked to get hold of a rifle and ammunition, or at\nleast to lay in biscuit and water, but for this there was no time. It was\nnot absolutely essential. The dull glow of the island was still visible. I\nhad my pillar of fire and smoke to guide me.\n\nWithout further delay I jerked loose the painter and drew the extra dory\nalongside.\n\nI had proceeded just so far in my movements, when the most extraordinary\nthing happened. I shall try to tell you of it as accurately as possible,\nand in the exact order of its occurrence. First a long, straight shaft of\nwhite light shot straight up through the cabin roof to a great height. It\nshone through the wooden planks as an ordinary light shines through glass.\nBy contrast the surrounding blackness was thrown into a deeper shade, and\nyet the shaft itself was so brilliant as almost to scotch the sight.\nCuriously enough, it was defined accurately, being exactly in shape like\none of the rectangular tin air-shafts you see so often in city hotels. At\nthe instant of its appearance, the wind fell quite calm.\n\nAlmost immediately the rectangle on the roof through which the light made\nits passage began to splay out, like lighted oil, although the column\nretained still the integrity of its outline. The fire, if such it could be\ncalled, ran with incredible rapidity along the seams between the planks,\nforward and aft, until the entire deck was sketched like a pyrotechnic\ndisplay in thin, vivid lines of incandescence. From each of these lines\nthen the fire began again to spread, as though soaking through the planks.\n\nAll took place practically in an instant of time. I had no opportunity to\nmove nor to cry out; indeed, my perceptions were inadequate to the task of\nmere observation. Up to now there had been no sound. The wind had fallen;\nthe waters passed unnoticed. A stillness of death seemed to have descended\non the ship. It was broken by a sharp double report, one as of the fall of\na metallic substance, the other caused by the body of Pulz, which, shaken\nloose from the truck by a heavy roll, smashed against the rail of the ship\nand splashed overboard. Someone cried out sharply. An instant later the\nentire crew struggled out from the companionway, rushed in grim silence to\nthe side of the vessel, and threw themselves into the sea.\n\nMy own ideas were somewhat confused. The fire had practically enveloped\nthe ship. I thought to feel it; and yet my skin was cool to the touch. The\nship's outlines became blurred. A dizziness overtook me; and then all at\nonce a great desire seized and shook my very soul. I cannot tell you the\nvehemence of this desire. It was a madness; nothing could stand in the way\nof its gratification. Whatever happened, I must have water. It was not\nthirst, nor yet a purpose to allay the very real physical burning of which\nI was now dimly conscious; but a craving for the liquid itself as\nsomething apart from and unconnected with anything else. Without\nhesitation, and as though it were the most natural thing in the world, I\nvaulted the rail to cast myself into the ocean. I dimly remember a last\nflying impression of a furnace of light, then a great shock thudded\nthrough me, and I lost consciousness.\n\n\n\n\nPART THREE\n\n\nTHE MAROON\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nIN THE WARDROOM\n\n\nOver the wardroom of the _Wolverine_ had fallen a silence. It held after\nSlade had finished. Captain Parkinson, stiff and erect in his chair,\nstaring fixedly at a spot two feet above the reporter's head, seemed to\nweigh, as a judge weighs, the facts so picturesquely, set forth. Dr.\nTrendon, his sturdy frame half in shadow, had slouched far down into\nhimself. Only the regard of his keen eyes fixed upon Slade's face,\nunwaveringly and a bit anxiously, showed that he was thinking of the\nnarrator as well as of the narrative. The others had fallen completely\nunder the spell of the tale. They sat, as children in a theatre, absorbed,\nforgetful of the world around them, wrapped in a more vivid element. At\nthe close, they stirred and blinked, half dazed by the abrupt fall of the\ncurtain.\n\nSlade had told his story with fire, with something of passion, even. Now\nhe felt the sharp reflex. He muttered uncertainly beneath his breath and\nglanced from one to another of the circled faces.\n\n\"That's all,\" he said unsteadily.\n\nThere passed through the group a stir and a murmur. Someone broke into\nsharp coughing. Chairs, shoved back, grated on the floor.\n\n\"Well, of all the extraordinary--\" began a voice, ruminatingly, and broke\nshort off, as if abashed at its own infraction of the silence.\n\n\"That's all,\" repeated Slade, a note of insistence in his voice. \"Why\ndon't you say something? Confound you, why don't you say something?\" His\nspeech rose husky and cracked. \"Don't you believe it?\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" said the surgeon quietly. \"No need to get excited.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" muttered the reporter, with a sudden lapse. \"Possibly you\nthink I'm romancing. It doesn't matter. I don't suppose I'd believe it\nmyself, in your place.\"\n\n\"But we're heading for the island,\" suggested Forsythe.\n\n\"That's so,\" cried Slade. \"Well, that's all right. Believe or disbelieve\nas much as you like. Only get Percy Darrow off that island. Then we'll\nhave his version. There are a few things I want to find out about,\nmyself.\"\n\n\"There are several that promise to be fairly interesting,\" said Forsythe,\nunder his breath.\n\nSlade turned to the captain. \"Have you any questions to put to me, sir?\"\nhe asked formally.\n\n\"Just one moment,\" interrupted Trendon. \"Boy, a pony of brandy for Mr.\nSlade.\"\n\nThe reporter drank the liquor and again turned to Captain Parkinson.\n\n\"Only about our men,\" said the commanding officer, after a little thought.\n\nSlade shook his head.\n\n\"I'm sorry I can't help you there, sir.\"\n\n\"Dr. Trendon said that you knew nothing about Edwards.\"\n\n\"Edwards?\" repeated Slade inquiringly. His mind, still absorbed in the\nevents which he had been relating, groped backward.\n\nTrendon came to his aid. \"Barnett asked you about him, you remember. It\nwas when you recovered consciousness. Our ensign. Took over charge of the\n_Laughing Lass_.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course. I was a little dazed, I fancy.\"\n\n\"We put Mr. Edwards aboard when we first picked up the deserted schooner,\"\nexplained the captain.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said the other. \"My head doesn't seem to work quite right\nyet. Just a moment, please.\" He sat silent, with closed eyes. \"You say you\npicked up the _Laughing Lass_. When?\" he asked presently.\n\n\"Four--five--six days ago, the first time.\"\n\n\"Then you put out the fire.\"\n\nThe circle closed in on Slade, with an unconscious hitching forward of\nchairs. He had fixed his eyes on the captain. His mouth worked. Obviously\nhe was under a tensity of endeavour in keeping his faculties set to the\nproblem. The surgeon watched him, frowning.\n\n\"There was no fire,\" said the captain.\n\nSlade leaped in his chair. \"No fire! But I saw her, I tell you. When I\nwent overboard she was one living flame!\"\n\n\"You landed in the small boat. Knocked you senseless,\" said Trendon.\n\"Concussion of the brain. Idea of flame might have been a retroactive\nhallucination.\"\n\n\"Retroactive rot,\" cried the other. \"I beg your pardon, Dr. Trendon. But\nif you'd seen her as I saw her--Barnett!\"\n\nHe turned in appeal to his old acquaintance.\n\n\"There was no fire, Slade,\" replied the executive officer gently. \"No sign\nof fire that we could find, except that the starboard rail was blistered.\"\n\n\"Oh, that was from the volcano,\" said Slade. \"That was nothing.\"\n\n\"It was all there was,\" returned Barnett.\n\n\"Just let me run this thing over,\" said the free lance slowly. \"You found\nthe schooner. She wasn't afire. She didn't even seem to have been afire.\nYou put a crew aboard under your ensign, Edwards. Storm separated you from\nher. You picked her up again deserted. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Day before yesterday morning.\"\n\n\"Then,\" cried the other excitedly, \"the fire was smouldering all the time.\nIt broke out and your men took to the water.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" said Barnett.\n\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" said the more downright surgeon.\n\n\"I hardly think Mr. Edwards would be driven overboard by a fire which did\nnot even scorch his ship,\" suggested the captain mildly.\n\n\"It drove our lot overboard,\" insisted Slade. \"Do you think we were a pack\nof cowards? I tell you, when that hellish thing broke loose, you had to\ngo. It wasn't fear. It wasn't pain. It was--What's the use. You can't\nexplain a thing like that.\"\n\n\"We certainly saw the glow the night Billy Edwards was--disappeared,\"\nmused Forsythe.\n\n\"And again, night before last,\" said the captain.\n\n\"What's that!\" cried Slade. \"Where is the _Laughing Lass_?\"\n\n\"I'd give something pretty to know,\" said Barnett.\n\n\"Isn't she in tow?\"\n\n\"In tow?\" said Forsythe. \"No, indeed. We hadn't adequate facilities for\ntowing her. Didn't you tell him, Mr. Barnett?\"\n\n\"Where is she, then?\" Slade fired the question at them like a cross-\nexaminer.\n\n\"Why, we shipped another crew under Ives and McGuire that noon. We were\nparted again, and haven't seen them since.\"\n\n\"God forgive you!\" said the reporter. \"After the warnings you'd had, too.\nIt was--it was--\"\n\n\"My orders, Mr. Slade,\" said Captain Parkinson, with quiet dignity.\n\n\"Of course, sir. I beg your pardon,\" returned the other. \"But--you say you\nsaw the light again?\"\n\n\"The first night they were out,\" said Barnett, in a low voice.\n\n\"Then your second crew is with your first crew,\" said Slade, shakily. \"And\nthey're with Thrackles, and Pulz and Solomon, and many another black-\nhearted scoundrel and brave seaman. Down there!\"\n\nHe pointed under foot. Captain Parkinson rose and went to his cabin. Slade\nrose, too, but his knees were unsteady. He tottered, and but for the swift\naid of Barnett's arm, would have fallen.\n\n\"Overdone,\" said Dr. Trendon, with some irritation. \"Cost you something in\nstrength. Foolish performance. Turn in now.\"\n\nSlade tried to protest, but the surgeon would not hear of it, and marched\nhim incontinently to his berth. Returning, Trendon reported, with growls\nof discontent, that his patient was in a fever.\n\n\"Couldn't expect anything else,\" he fumed. \"Pack of human interrogation\npoints hounding him all over the place.\"\n\n\"What do you think of his story?\" asked Forsythe.\n\nThe grizzled surgeon drew out a cigar, lighted it, took three deliberate\npuffs, turned it about, examined the ash end with concentration, and\nreplied:\n\n\"Man's telling a straight story.\"\n\n\"You think it's all true?\" cried Forsythe.\n\n\"Humph!\" grunted the other. \"_He thinks it's all true_.\"\n\nAn orderly appeared and knocked at the captain's cabin.\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" they heard him say. \"Mr. Carter would like to know how\nclose in to run. Volcano's acting up pretty bad, sir.\"\n\nCaptain Parkinson went on deck, followed by the rest.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE JOLLY ROGER\n\n\nFeeling the way forward, the cruiser was soon caught in a maze of cross\ncurrents. Hither and thither she was borne, a creature bereft of volition.\nOrder followed order like the rattle of quick-fire, and was obeyed with\nsomething more than the _Wolverine's_ customary smartness. From the bridge\nCaptain Parkinson himself directed his ship. His face was placid: his\nbearing steady and confident. This in itself was sufficient earnest that\nthe cruiser was in ticklish case. For it was an axiom of the men who\nsailed under Parkinson that the calmer that nervous man grew, the more\ncause was there for nervousness on the part of others.\n\nThe approach was from the south, but suspicious aspects of the water had\nfended the cruiser out and around, until now she stood prow-on to a bold\nheadland at the northwest corner of the island. Above this headland lay a\ndark pall of vapour. In the shifting breeze it swayed sluggishly, heavily,\nas if riding at anchor like a logy ship of the air. Only once did it show\nany marked movement.\n\n\"It's spreading out toward us,\" said Barnett to his fellow officers,\ngathered aft.\n\n\"Time to move, then,\" grunted Trendon.\n\nThe others looked at him inquiringly.\n\n\"About as healthful as prussic acid, those volcanic gases,\" explained the\nsurgeon.\n\nThe ship edged on and inward. Presently the sing-song of the leadsman\nsounded in measured distinctness through the silence. Then a sudden\nactivity and bustle forward, the rattle of chains, and the _Wolverine_ was\nat anchor. The captain came down from the bridge.\n\n\"What do you think, Dr. Trendon?\" he asked.\n\nMore explicit inquiry was not necessary.\n\nThe surgeon understood what was in his superior's mind.\n\n\"Never can tell about volcanoes, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course,\" agreed the captain. \"But--well, do you recognise any of the\nsymptoms?\"\n\n\"Want me to diagnose a case of earthquake, sir?\" grinned Trendon. \"She\nmight go off to-day, or she might behave herself for a century.\"\n\n\"Well, it's all chance,\" said the other, cheerfully. \"The man _might_ be\nalive. At any rate we must do our best on that theory. What do you make of\nthat cloud on the peak?\"\n\n\"Poisonous vapours, I suppose. Thought we'd have a chance to make sure\njust now. Seemed to be coming right for us. Wind's shifted it since.\"\n\n\"There couldn't be anything alive up there?\"\n\n\"Not so much as a bug,\" replied the doctor positively.\n\n\"Yet I thought when the vapour lifted a bit that I saw something moving.\"\n\n\"When was that, sir?\"\n\n\"Ten or fifteen minutes back.\"\n\n\"We'll see soon enough, sir,\" put in Forsythe. \"The wind is driving it\ndown to the south'ard.\"\n\nSullenly, reluctantly, the forbidding mass moved across the headland. All\nglasses were bent upon it. Without taking his binocular from his eyes,\nTrendon began to ruminate aloud.\n\n\"If he could have got to the beach.... No vapour there.... Signal,\nthough.... Perhaps he hadn't time.... And I'd hate to risk good men on\nthat hell's cauldron.... Just as much risk here, perhaps. Only it seems--\"\n\n\"There it is,\" cried Forsythe. \"Look. The highest point.\"\n\nDull, gray wisps of murk, the afterguard of the gaseous cloud, were\ntwisting and spiraling in a witch-dance across the landscape, and, seen by\nsnatches and glimpses through it, something flapped darkly in the breeze.\nSuddenly the veil parted and fled. A flag stood forth in the sharp gust,\nrigid, and appalling. It was black.\n\n\"The Jolly Roger, by God! They've come back!\" exclaimed Forsythe.\n\n\"And set up the sign of their shop,\" added Barnett.\n\n\"If they stuck to their flag--good-bye,\" observed Trendon grimly.\n\n\"Dr. Trendon,\" said Captain Parkinson, \"you will arm yourself and go with\nme in the gig to make a landing.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" responded the surgeon.\n\n\"Mr. Barnett.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Should we be overtaken by the vapour while on the highland and be unable\nto get back to the beach, you are to send no rescuing party up there until\nthe air has cleared.\"\n\n\"But, sir, may we not--\"\n\n\"Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"In case of an attack you will at once send in another boat with a\nhowitzer.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Dr. Trendon, will you see Mr. Slade and inquire of him the best point for\nlanding?\"\n\nTrendon hesitated.\n\n\"I suppose it would hardly do to take him with us?\" pursued the commanding\nofficer.\n\n\"If he is roused now, even for a moment, I won't answer for the\nconsequences, sir,\" said the surgeon bluntly.\n\n\"Surely you can have him point out a landing place,\" said the captain.\n\n\"On your responsibility,\" returned the other, obstinately. \"He's under\nopiate now.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" said Captain Parkinson, after a time.\n\nGoing in, they saw no sign of life along the shore. Even the birds had\ndeserted it. For the time the volcano seemed to have pretermitted its\nactivity. Now and again there was a spurtle of smoke from the cone,\nfollowed by subterranean growlings, but, on the whole, the conditions were\nreassuring.\n\n\"Penny-pop-pinwheel of a volcano, anyhow,\" remarked Trendon,\ndisparagingly. \"Real man-size eruption would have wiped the whole thing\noff the map, first whack.\"\n\nAs they drew in, it became apparent that they must scale the cliff from\nthe boat. Farther to the south opened out a wide cove that suggested easy\nbeaching, but over it hung a cloud of steam.\n\n\"Lava pouring down,\" said Trendon.\n\nFortunately at the point where the cliff looked easiest the seas ran low.\nRopes had been brought. After some dainty manoeuvring two of the sailors\ngained foothold and slung the ropes so that the remainder of the\ndisembarcation was simple. Nor was the ascent of the cliff a harsh task.\nHalf an hour after the landing the exploring party stood on the summit of\nthe hill, where the black flag waved over a scene of utter desolation. The\nvegetation was withered to pallid rags: even the tiniest weedling in the\nrock crevices had been poisoned by the devastating blast.\n\nIn the midst of that deathly scene, the flag seemed instinct with a\nsinister liveliness. Whoever had set it there had accurately chosen the\nhighest available point on that side of the island, the spot of all others\nwhere it would make good its signal to the eye of any chance farer upon\nthose shipless seas. For the staff a ten-foot sapling, finely polished,\nserved. A mound of rock-slabs supported it firmly. Upon the cloth itself\nwas no design. It was of a dull black, the hue of soot. Captain Parkinson,\nstanding a few yards off, viewed it with disfavour.\n\n\"Furl that flag,\" he ordered.\n\nCongdon, the coxswain of the gig, stepped forward and began to work at the\nfastenings. Presently he turned a grinning face to the captain, who was\nscanning the landscape through his glass.\n\n\"Beggin' your pardon, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" demanded Captain Parkinson.\n\n\"Beggin' your pardon, sir, that ain't rightly no flag. That's what you\nmight rightly call a garment, sir. It's an undershirt, beggin' your\npardon.\"\n\n\"Black undershirt's a new one to me,\" muttered Trendon.\n\n\"No, sir. It ain't rightly black, look.\"\n\nWrenching the object from its fastenings, he flapped it violently. A cloud\nof sooty dust, beaten out, spread about his face. With a strangled cry the\nsailor cast the shirt from him and rolled in agony upon the ground.\n\n\"You fool!\" cried Trendon. \"Stand back, all of you.\"\n\nOpening his medicine case, he bent over the racked sufferer. Presently the\nman sat up, pale and abashed.\n\n\"That's how poisonous volcanic gas is,\" said the surgeon to his commanding\nofficer. \"Only inhaled remnants of the dust, too.\"\n\n\"An ill outlook for the man we're seeking,\" the captain mused.\n\n\"Dead if he's anywhere on this highland,\" declared Trendon. \"Let's look at\nhis flag-pole.\"\n\nHe examined the staff. \"Came from the beach,\" he pronounced. \"Waterworn.\nH'm! Maybe he ain't so dead, either.\"\n\n\"I don't quite follow you, Dr. Trendon.\"\n\n\"Why, I guess our man has figured this thing all out. Brought this pole up\nfrom the beach to plant it here. Why? Because this was the best\nobservation point. No good as a permanent residence, though. Planted his\nflag and went back.\"\n\n\"Why didn't we see him on the beach, then?\"\n\n\"Did you notice a cave around to the north? Good refuge in case of fumes.\"\n\n\"It's worth trying,\" said the captain, putting up his glass.\n\n\"Hold on, sir. What's this? Here's something. Look here.\"\n\nTrendon pointed to a small bit of wood rather neatly carved to the shape\nof an indicatory finger, and lashed to the staff, at the height of a man's\nface. The others clustered around.\n\n\"Oh, the devil!\" cried Trendon. \"It must have got twisted. It's pointing\nstraight down.\"\n\n\"Strange performance,\" said the captain. \"However, since it points that\nway--heave aside those rocks, men.\"\n\nThe first slab lifted brought to light a corner of cardboard. This, on\ncloser examination, proved to be the cover of a book. The rocks rolled\nright and left, and as the flag-staff, deprived of its support, tottered\nand fell, the trove was dragged forth and handed to the captain. While the\nground jarred with occasional tremors and the mountain puffed forth its\nvaporous threats, he and the surgeon, seated on a rock, gave themselves\nwith complete absorption to the reading.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE CACHE\n\n\nOutwardly the book accorded ill with its surroundings. In that place of\ndesolation and death, it typified the petty neatness of office processes.\nProperly placed, it should have been found on a desk, with pens, rulers,\nand other paraphernalia forming exact angles or parallels to it. It was a\nquarto, bound in marbled paper, with black leather over the hinges. No\nexternal label suggested its ownership or uses, but through one corner,\nblackened and formidable in its contrast to the peaceful purposes of the\nvolume, a hole had been bored. The agency of perforation was obvious. A\nbullet had made it.\n\n\"Seen something of life, I reckon,\" said Trendon, as the captain turned\nthe volume about slowly in his hands.\n\n\"And of death,\" returned Captain Parkinson solemnly. \"Do you know,\nTrendon, I almost dread to open this.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" returned the other. \"What is it to us?\"\n\nHe threw the cover back. Neatly lettered on the inside, in the fine and\nslightly angular writing characteristic of the Teutonic scholar, was the\nlegend:\n\n    Karl Augustus Schermerhorn,\n        1409-1/2 Spruce Street,\n            Philadelphia, Pa.\n\n[Illustration: With a strangled cry the sailor cast the shirt from him]\n\nThe opposite page was blank. Captain Parkinson turned half a dozen leaves.\n\n\"German!\" he cried, in a note of disappointment, \"Can you read German\nscript?\"\n\n\"After a fashion,\" replied the other. \"Let's see. _Es wonnte sechs--und--\ndreissig unterjacke_,\" he read. \"Why, blast it, was the man running a\nhaberdashery? What have three dozen undershirts to do with this?\"\n\n\"A memorandum for outfitting, probably,\" suggested the captain. \"Try\nhere.\"\n\n\"Chemical formulae,\" said Trendon. \"Pages of 'em. The devil! Can't make a\nthing of it.\"\n\n\"Well, here's something in English.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the other. \"_By combining the hyper-sulphate of iridium with\nthe fumes arising from oxide of copper heated to 1000 C. and combining\nwith picric acid in the proportions described in formula x 18, a reaction,\nthe nature of which I have not fully determined, follows. This must be\nperformed with extreme care owing to the unstable nature of the benzene\ncompounds._\"\n\n\"Picric acid? Benzene compounds? Those are high explosives,\" said Captain\nParkinson. \"We should have Barnett go over this.\"\n\n\"Here's a name under the formula. _Dr. A. Mardenter, Ann Arbor, Mich_.\nThat explains its being in English. Probably copied from a letter.\"\n\n\"This must have been one of the experiments in the valley that Slade told\nus of,\" said the captain, thoughtfully. \"Why, see here,\" he cried, with\nsomething like exultation. \"That's what Dr. Schermerhorn was doing here.\nHe has the clue to some explosive so terrific that he goes far out of the\nworld to experiment with its manufacture. For companions he chooses a gang\nof cutthroats that the world would never miss in case anything went wrong.\nPossibly it was some trial of the finished product that started the\neruption, even. Do you see?\"\n\n\"Don't explain enough,\" grunted Trendon. \"Deserted ship. Billy Edwards.\nMysterious lights. Slade and his story. Any explosives in those? Good\nenough, far as it goes. Don't go far enough.\"\n\n\"It certainly leaves gaps,\" admitted the other.\n\nHe turned over a few more pages.\n\n\"Formulas, formulas, formulas. What's this? Here are some marginal\nannotations.\"\n\n\"Unbehasslich,\" read Trendon. \"Let's see. That means 'highly\nunsatisfactory,' or words to that effect. Hi! Here's where the old man\nloses his temper. Listen: _'May the devil take Carroll and Crum for\ncareless'_--h'm--well, _'pig-dogs.'_ Now, where do Carroll and Crum come\nin?\"\n\n\"They're a firm of analytical chemists in Washington,\" said the captain.\n\"When I was on the ordnance board I used to get their circulars.\"\n\n\"Fits in. What? More English? Worse than the German, this is.\"\n\nThe writing, beginning evenly enough at the top of a page, ran along for a\nline or two, then fell, sprawling in huge, ragged characters the full\nlength. Trendon stumbled among them, indignantly.\n\n\"_June 1, 1904_,\" he read. \"_It is done. Triumph_. (German word.) _Eureka.\nEs ist gefillt. From the_ (can't make out that word) _of the\ninspiration--god-like power--solution of the world-problems_. Why, the\nold fool is crazy! And his writing is crazier. Can't make head or tail of\nit.\"\n\nThe captain turned several more pages. They were blank. \"At any rate, it\nseems to be the end,\" he said.\n\n\"I should hope so,\" returned the other, disgustedly.\n\nHe took the book on his knees, fluttering the leaves between thumb and\nfinger. Suddenly he checked, cast back, and threw the book wide open.\n\n\"Here beginneth a new chapter,\" said he, quietly.\n\nNo imaginable chirography could have struck the eye with more of contrast\nto the professor's small and nervous hand. Large, rounded, and rambling,\nit filled the page with few and careless words.\n\n_June 2, 1904. On this date I find myself sole occupant and absolute\nmonarch of this valuable island. This morning I was a member of a\ncommunity, interesting if not precisely peaceful. To-night I am the last\nleaf. 'All his lovely companions are faded and gone,' the sprightly\nSolomon, the psychic <DW65>, the amiable Thrackles, the cheerful Perdosa,\nthe genial Pulz, and the high-minded Eagen. Undoubtedly the social\natmosphere has cleared; moreover, I am for the first time in my life a\nlanded proprietor. Item: several square miles of grass land; item: several\ndozen head of sheep; item: a cove full of fish; item: a handsomely\ndecorated cave; item: a sportive though somewhat unruly volcano. At times,\nit may be, I shall feel the lack of company. The seagulls alone are not\ndistrustful of me. Undoubtedly the seagull is an estimable creature, but\nhe leaves something to be desired in the way of companionship. Hence this\ndiary, the inevitable refuge of the empty-minded. Materially, I shall do\nwell enough, though I face one tragic circumstance. My cigarette material,\nI find, is short. Upon counting up--\"_\n\n\"Damn his cigarettes!\" cried the surgeon. \"This must be Darrow. Finicky\nbeast! Let's see if it's signed.\"\n\nHe whirled the leaves over to the last sheet, glanced at it, and sprang to\nhis feet. There, sprawled in tremulous characters, as by a hand shaken\nwith agony or terror, was written:\n\n    _Look for me in the cave.\n                         Percy Darrow._\n\nThe bullet hole in the corner furnished a sinister period to the\nsignature.\n\nTrendon handed the ledger back to the captain, who took one quick look,\nclosed it, and handed it to Congdon.\n\n\"Wrap that up and carry it carefully,\" he said.\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said the coxswain, swathing it in his jacket and tucking\nit under his arm.\n\n\"Now to find that cave,\" said Captain Parkinson to the surgeon.\n\n\"The cave in the cliff, of course,\" said Trendon. \"Noticed it coming in,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"On the north shore, about a mile to the east of here.\"\n\n\"Then we'll cut directly across.\"\n\n\"Beg your pardon, sir,\" put in Congdon, \"but I don't think we can make it\nfrom this side, sir.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"No beach, sir, and the cliff's like the side of a ship. Looks to be deep\nwater right into the cave's mouth.\"\n\n\"Back to the boat, then. Bring that flag along.\"\n\nThe descent was swift, at times reckless, but the party embarked without\naccident. Soon they were forging through the water at racing speed, the\nboat leaping to the impulsion of the sailorman's strongest motives,\ncuriosity and the hope of saving a life.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE TWIN SLABS\n\n\nWithin half an hour the gig had reached the mouth of the cave. As the\ncoxswain had predicted, the seas ran into the lofty entrance. Elsewhere\nthe surf fell whitely, but through the arch the waves rolled unbroken into\na heavy stillness. Only as the boat hovered for a moment at the face of\nthe cliff could the exploring party hear, far within, the hollow boom that\ntold of breakers on a distant, subterranean beach.\n\n\"Run her in easy,\" came the captain's order. \"Keep a sharp lookout for\nhidden rocks.\"\n\nTo the whispering plash of the oars they moved from sunlight into\ntwilight, from twilight into darkness. Of a sudden the oars jerked\nconvulsively. A great roar had broken upon the ears of the sailors; the\ninvisible roof above them, the water heaving beneath them, the walls that\nhemmed them in, called, with a multiplication of resonance, upon the name\nof Darrow. The boat quivered with the start of its occupants. Then one or\ntwo laughed weakly as they realised that what they had heard was no\nsupernatural voice. It was the captain hailing for the marooned man.\n\nNo vocal answer came. But an indeterminable space away they could hear a\nlow splash followed by a second and a third. Something coughed weakly in\nfront and to the right. Trendon's hand went to his revolver. The men sat,\nstiffened. One of them swore, in a whisper, and the oath came back upon\nthem, echoing the name of the Saviour in hideous sibilance.\n\n\"Silence in the boat,\" said the captain, in such buoyant tones that the\nmen braced themselves against the expected peril.\n\n\"Light the lantern and pass it to me,\" came the order. \"Keep below the\ngunwale, men.\"\n\nAs the match spluttered: \"Do you see something, a few rods to port?\" asked\nthe captain in Trendon's ear.\n\n\"Pair of green lights,\" said Trendon. \"Eyes. _Seals!_\"\n\n\"_Seals! Seals! Seals_!\" shouted the walls, for the surgeon had suddenly\nreleased his voice. And as the mockery boomed, the green lights\ndisappeared and there was more splashing from the distance. The crew sat\nup again.\n\nThe lantern spread its radiance. It was reflected from battlements of\nfairy beauty. Everywhere the walls were set, as with gems, in broad wales\nof varied and vivid hues. Dazzled at first, the explorers soon were able\nto discern the general nature of the subterranean world which they had\nentered. In most places the walls rose sheer and unscaleable from the\nwater. In others, turretted rocks thrust their gleaming crags upward. Over\nto starboard a little beach shone with Quaker greyness in that spectacular\ndisplay. The end of the cavern was still beyond the area of light.\n\n\"Must have been a swimmer to get in here,\" commented Trendon, glancing at\nthe walls.\n\n\"Unless he had a boat,\" said the captain. \"But why doesn't he answer?\"\n\n\"Better try again. No telling how much more there is of this.\"\n\nThe surgeon raised his ponderous bellow, and the cave roared again with\nthe summons. Silence, formidable and unbroken, succeeded.\n\n\"House to house search is now in order,\" he said. \"Must be in here\nsomewhere--unless the seals got him.\"\n\nCautiously the boat moved forward. Once she grazed on a half submerged\nrock. Again a tiny islet loomed before her. Scattered bones glistened on\nthe rocky shore, but they were not human relics. Occasional beaches\ntempted a landing, but all of these led back to precipitous cliffs except\none, from the side of which opened two small caves. Into the first the\nlantern cast its glare, revealing emptiness, for the arch was wide and the\ncave shallow. The entrance to the other was so narrow as to send a visitor\nto his knees. But inside it seemed to open out. Moreover, there were fish\nbones at the entrance. The captain, the surgeon, and Congdon, the\ncoxswain, landed. Captain Parkinson reached the spot first. Stooping, he\nthrust his head in at the orifice. A sharp exclamation broke from him. He\nrose to his feet, turning a contorted face to the others.\n\n\"Poisonous,\" he cried.\n\n\"More volcano,\" said Trendon. He bent to the black hole and sniffed\ncautiously.\n\n\"I'll go in, sir,\" volunteered Congdon. \"I've had fire-practice.\"\n\n\"My business,\" said Trendon, briefly. \"Decomposition; unpleasant, but not\ndangerous.\"\n\nPushing the lantern before him, he wormed his way until the light was\nblotted out. Presently it shone forth from the funnel, showing that the\nexplorer had reached the inner open space. Captain Parkinson dropped down\nand peered in, but the evil odour was too much for him. He retired,\ngagging and coughing. Trendon was gone for what seemed an interminable\ntime. His superior officer fidgeted uneasily. At last he could stand it no\nlonger.\n\n\"Dr. Trendon, are you all right?\" he shouted.\n\n\"Yup,\" answered a choked voice. \"Cubbing oud dow.\"\n\nAgain the funnel was darkened. A pair of feet appeared; then the surgeon's\nchunky trunk, his head, and the lantern. Once, twice, and thrice he\ninhaled deeply.\n\n\"Phew!\" he gasped. \"Thought I was tough, but--Phee-ee-ee-ew!\"\n\n\"Did you find--\"\n\n\"No, sir. Not Darrow. Only a poor devil of a seal that crawled in there to\ndie.\"\n\nThe exploration continued. Half a mile, as they estimated, from the open,\nthey reached a narrow beach, shut off by a perpendicular wall of rock.\nSkirting this, they returned on the other side, minutely examining every\npossible crevice. When they again reached the light of day, they had\narrived at the certain conclusion that no living man was within those\nwalls.\n\n\"Would a corpse rise to the surface soon in waters such as these, Dr.\nTrendon?\" asked the captain.\n\n\"Might, sir. Might not. No telling that.\"\n\nThe captain ruminated. Then he beat his fist on his knee.\n\n\"The other cave!\"\n\n\"What other cave?\" asked the surgeon.\n\n\"The cave where they killed the seals.\"\n\n\"Surely!\" exclaimed Trendon. \"Wait, though. Didn't Slade say it was\nbetween here and the point?\"\n\n\"Yes. Beyond the small beach.\"\n\n\"No cave there,\" declared the surgeon positively.\n\n\"There must be. Congdon, did you see an opening anywhere in the cliff as\nwe came along?\"\n\n\"No, sir. This is the only one, sir.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that,\" said the captain, grimly. \"Head her about. Skirt\nthe shore as near the breakers as you safely can.\"\n\nThe gig retraced its journey.\n\n\"There's the beach, as Slade described it,\" said Captain Parkinson, as\nthey came abreast of the little reach of sand.\n\n\"And what are those two bird-roosts on it?\" asked Trendon. \"See 'em? Dead\nagainst that patch of shore-weed.\"\n\n\"Bits of wreckage fixed in the sand.\"\n\n\"Don't think so, sir. Too well matched.\"\n\n\"We have no time to settle the matter now,\" said the captain impatiently.\n\"We must find that cave, if it is to be found.\"\n\nHovering just outside the final drag of the surf, under the skilful\nguidance of Congdon, the boat moved slowly along the line of beach to the\nline of cliff. All was open as the day. The blazing sun picked out each\ndetail of jut and hollow. Evidently the poisonous vapours from the volcano\nhad not spread their blight here, for the face of the precipice was bright\nwith many flowers. So close in moved the boat that its occupants could\neven see butterflies fluttering above the bloom. But that which their\neager eyes sought was still denied them. No opening offered in that\nsmiling cliff-side. Not by so much as would admit a terrier did the mass\nof rock and rubble gape.\n\n\"And Slade described the cave as big enough to ram the _Wolverine_ into,\"\nmuttered Trendon.\n\nUp to the point of the headland, and back, passed the boat. Blank\ndisappointment was the result.\n\n\"What is your opinion now, Dr. Trendon?\" asked the captain of the older\nman.\n\n\"Don't know, sir,\" answered the surgeon hopelessly. \"Looks as if the cave\nmight have been a hallucination.\"\n\n\"I shall have something to say to Mr. Slade on our return,\" said the\ncaptain crisply. \"If the cave was an hallucination, as you suggest, the\nseal-murder was fiction.\"\n\n\"Looks so,\" agreed the other.\n\n\"And the murder of the captain. How about that?\"\n\n\"And the mutiny of the men,\" added the surgeon.\n\n\"And the killing of the doctor. Your patient seems to be a romantic\ngenius.\"\n\n\"And the escape of Darrow. Hold hard,\" quoth Trendon. \"Darrow's no\nromance. Nothing fictional about the flag and ledger.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" said the captain, and fell to consideration.\n\n\"Anyway,\" said Trendon vigorously, \"I'd like to have a look at those bird-\nroosts. Mighty like signposts, to my mind.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the captain. \"It'll cost us only a wetting. Run her in,\nCongdon.\"\n\nWith all the coxswain's skill, and the oarsmen's technique, the passage of\nthe surf was a lively one, and little driblets of water marked the trail\nof the officers as they shuffled up the beach.\n\nThe two slabs stood less than fifty yards beyond high water tide. Nearing\nthem, the visitors saw that each marked a mound, but not until they were\nclose up could they read the neat carving on the first. It ran as follows:\n\n            _Here lies_\n           SOLOMON ANDERSON\n              _alias_\n            HANDY SOLOMON\n    _who murdered his employer,\n    his captain, and his shipmates,\n    and was found, dead\n    of his deserts, on these shores,\n    June 5, 1904.\n\n    This slab is erected as a\n    memento of admiring esteem\n               by\n    the last of his victims.\n\n    \"And you can kiss the\n    Book on that.\"_\n\n\"Percy Darrow _fecit_,\" said the surgeon. \"You can kiss the Book on\n_that_, too.\"\n\n\"Then Slade was telling the truth!\"\n\n\"Apparently. Seems good corroboration.\"\n\nThe captain turned to the other mound. Its slab was carved by the same\nhand.\n\n  _Sacred to the memory of an\n  Ensign of the U. S. Navy,\n  whose body, washed upon this\n  coast, is here buried with all\n  reverence, by strange hands;\n  whose soul may God rest.\n  \"The seas shall sing his\n  requiem.\" June the Sixth,\n  MXMIV._\n\n\"Billy Edwards,\" said the captain, very low.\n\nHe uncovered. The surgeon did likewise. So, for a space, they stood with\nbared heads between the twin graves.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE PINWHEEL VOLCANO\n\n\nThe surgeon spoke first.\n\n\"Another point,\" said he. \"Darrow was alive within a few days.\"\n\nCaptain Parkinson turned slowly away from the grave. \"You are right,\" he\nsaid, with an effort. \"Our business is with the living now. The dead must\nwait.\"\n\n\"Hide and seek,\" growled Trendon. \"If he's here why don't he show\nhimself?\"\n\nThe other shook his head.\n\n\"Place is all trampled up with his footprints,\" said Trendon. \"He's\nplodded back and forth like a prisoner in a cell.\"\n\n\"The ledger,\" said the captain. \"I'd forgotten it. That grave drove\neverything else out of my mind.\"\n\n\"Bring the book here,\" called Trendon.\n\nCongdon unwrapped it from his jacket and handed it to him. The sailors\ncast curious glances at the two headstones.\n\n\"Mount guard over Mr. Edwards's grave,\" commanded the captain.\n\nThe coxswain saluted and gave an order. One of the sailors stepped forward\nto the first mound.\n\n\"Not that one,\" rasped the officer. \"The other.\"\n\nThe man saluted and moved on.\n\n\"With your permission, sir,\" said Trendon.\n\nOn a nod from his superior officer he opened the ledger and took up\nDarrow's record.\n\n\"Here it is. Entry of June 3d.\"\n\n\"_Everything lovely. Schooner lost to sight. Query--to memory dear? Not\nexactly. Though I shouldn't mind having her under orders for a few days.\nQueer glow in the sky last night: if they've been investigating they may\nhave got what's coming to them. Volcano exhibiting fits of temper. Spouted\nout considerable fire about nine o'clock. Quite spectacular, but no harm\ndone. Can foresee short rations of tobacco. Lava in valley still too hot\nfor comfort. No sign of Dr. Schermerhorn. Still sleep on beach_.\n\n\"Not much there,\" sniffed Trendon. \"Go on,\" said the captain.\n\n\"_June 3. Evening. Thick and squally weather again. Local atmospheric\nconditions seem upset. Volcano still leading strenuous life. Climbed the\nheadland this afternoon. Wind very shifty. Got an occasional whiff of\nvolcanic output. One in particular would have sent a skunk to the camphor\nbottle. No living on the headland. Will explore cave to-morrow with a view\nto domicile. Have come down to an allowance of seven cigarettes per diem.\n\n\"June 4. Explored cave to-day. Full of dead seals. Not only dead, but all\nbitten and cut to pieces. Must have been lively doings in Seal-Town. Not\nmuch choice between air in the cave and vapours from the volcano. Barring\nseals, everything suitable for light housekeeping, such as mine. Undertook\nto clean house. Dragged late lamented out into the water. Some sank and\nwere swept away by the sea-puss. Others, I regret to say, floated. Found\ntrickle of fresh water in depth of cave, and little sand-ledge to sleep\non. So far, so good: we may be 'appy yet. If only I had my cigarette\nsupply. Once heard a botanist say that leaves of the white shore-willow\nmade fair substitute for tobacco. Fair substitute for nux vomica! Would\nlike to interview said botanist_.\n\n\"The fellow is a tobacco maniac,\" growled Trendon, feeling in his breast\npocket. \"The devil,\" he cried, bringing forth an empty hand.\n\nSilently the captain handed him a cigar. \"Thank you, sir,\" he said,\nlighted it, and continued reading.\n\n\"_June 5. Had a caller to-day. Climbed the headland this morning. Found\nvolcano taking a day off. Looking for sign of _Laughing Lass_, noticed\nsomething heliographing to me from the waves beyond the reef. Seemed to be\nmetal. I guessed a tin can. Caught in the swirl, it rounded the cape, and\nI came down to the shore to meet it. Halfway down the cliff I had a better\nview. I saw it was not a tin can. There was a dark body under it, which\nthe waves were tossing about, and as the metal moved with the body, it\nglinted in the sun. Suddenly it was borne in upon me that an arm was doing\nthe signalling, waving to me with a sprightly, even a jocular\nfriendliness. Then I saw what it really was. It was Handy Solomon and his\nsteel hook. He was riding quite high. Every now and again he would bow and\nwave. He grounded gently on the sand beach. I planted him promptly. First,\nhowever, I removed a bag of tobacco from his pocket. Poor stuff, and water\nsoaked, but still tobacco. Spent a quiet afternoon carving a headstone for\nthe dear departed. Pity it were that virtues so shining should be\nuncommemorated. Idle as the speculation is, I wonder who my next visitor\nwill be. Thrackles, I hope. Evidently some of them have been playing the\npart of Pandora. Spent last night in the cave. Air quite fresh.\n\n\"June 6. Saw the glow again last night.\"_\n\nThe surgeon paused in his reading. \"That would be the night of the 5th:\nthe night before we picked her up empty.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Captain Parkinson. \"That was the night Billy Edwards--Go\non.\"\n\n\"_Saw the glow again last night. Don't understand it. Once should have\nbeen enough for them. This matter of hoarding tobacco may be a sad error.\nIf Old Spitfire keeps on the way she has to-day I shan't need much more.\nIt would be a raw jest to be burned or swallowed up with a month's supply\nof unsmoked cigarettes on one. Cave getting shaky. Still, I think I'll\nstick there. As between being burned alive and buried alive, I'm for the\nrespectable and time honoured fashion of interment. Bombardment was mostly\nto the east to-day, but no telling when it may shift.\n\n\"June 7. This morning I found a body rolling in the surf. It was the body\nof a young man, large and strongly built, dressed in the uniform of an\nensign of our navy. Surely a strange visitor to these shores! There was no\nmark of identification upon him except a cigarette case graven with an\nundecipherable monogram in Tiffany's most illegible style of arrow-headed\ninscription. This I buried with him, and staked the grave with a\nheadboard. An officer and a gentleman, a youth of friendly ways and kindly\nliving, if one may judge by the face of the dead; and he comes by the same\nend to the same goal as Handy Solomon. Why not? And why should one\nphilosophise in a book that will never be read? Hold on! Perhaps--just\nperhaps--it may be read. The officer was not long dead. Ensigns of the U.\nS. navy do not wander about untraversed waters alone. There must be a\nwarship somewhere in the vicinity. But why, then, an unburied officer\nfloating on the ocean? I will smoke upon this, luxuriously and\nplentifully. (Later.) No use. I can't solve it. But one thing I do. I put\nup a signal pole on the headland and cache this record under it this\nafternoon. From day to day, with the kindly permission of the volcano, I\nwill add to it.... Bad doings by Old Spitfire. The cloud is coming down on\nme. Also seems to be moving along the cliff. I will retire hastily to my\nprivate estate in the cave_.\n\n\"That's all, except the scrawl on the last page,\" said Trendon. \"Some\naction of the volcano scared him off. He just had time to scrawl that last\nmessage and drop the book into the cache. The question is, did he get back\nalive?\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" said the captain. \"We will search the headland for his\nbody.\"\n\n\"But the cave,\" insisted the surgeon. \"We ought to have found some sign of\nhim there.\"\n\n\"Slade is the solution,\" said the captain. \"We must ask him.\"\n\nThey put back to the ship. Barnett was anxiously awaiting them.\n\n\"Your patient has been in a bad way, Dr. Trendon,\" he said.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Trendon, frowning.\n\n\"He came up on deck, wild-eyed and staggering. There was a sheet of paper\nin his hand which seemed to have some bearing on his trouble. When he\nfound you had gone to the island without him he began to rage like a\nmaniac. I had to have him carried down by force. In the rumpus the paper\ndisappeared. I assumed the responsibility of giving him an opiate.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" approved Trendon. \"I'll go down. Will you come with me,\nsir?\" he said to the captain.\n\nThey found Slade in profound slumber.\n\n\"Won't do to wake him now,\" growled Trendon. \"Hello, what's here?\"\n\nLying in the hollow of the sick man's right hand, where it had been\ncrushed to a ball, was a crumpled mass of tracing paper. Trendon smoothed\nit out, peered at it and passed it to the captain.\n\n\"It's a sketch of an Indian arrow-head,\" he exclaimed in surprise, at the\nfirst glance. \"What are all these marks?\"\n\n\"Map of the island,\" barked Trendon. \"Look here.\"\n\nThe drawing was a fairly careful one, showing such geographical points as\nhad been of concern to the two-year inhabitants. There was the large\ncavern, indicated as they had found it, and at a point between it and the\nheadland the legend, \"Seal Cave.\"\n\n\"But it's wrong,\" cried Captain Parkinson, setting finger to the spot. \"We\npassed there twice. There's no opening.\"\n\n\"No guarantee that there may not have been,\" returned the other. \"This\nisland has been considerably shaken up lately. Entrance may have been\nclosed by a landslide down the cliff. Noticed signs myself, but didn't\nthink of it in connection with the cave.\"\n\n\"That's work for Barnett, then,\" said the captain, brightening. \"We'll\nblow up the whole face of the cliff, if necessary, but we'll get at that\ncave.\"\n\nHe hurried out. Order followed order, and soon the gig, with the captain,\nTrendon, and the torpedo expert, was driving for the point marked \"Seal\nCave\" on the map over which they were bent.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nMR. DARROW RECEIVES\n\n\n\"You say the last entry is June 7th?\" asked Barnett, as the boat entered\nthe light surf.\n\nTrendon nodded.\n\n\"That was the night we saw the last glow, and the big burst from the\nvolcano, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"The island would have been badly shaken up.\"\n\n\"Not so violently but that the flag-pole stood,\" said the captain.\n\n\"That's true, sir. But there's been a good deal of volcanic gas going. The\nman's been penned up for four days.\"\n\n\"Give the fellow a chance,\" growled Trendon. \"Air may be all right in the\ncave. Good water there, too. Says so himself. By Slade's account he's a\npretty capable citizen when it comes to looking after himself. Wouldn't\nwonder if we'd find him fit as a fiddle.\"\n\n\"There was no clue to Ives and McGuire?\" asked Barnett presently.\n\n\"None.\" It was the captain who answered.\n\nThe gig grated, and the tide being high, they waded to the base of the\ncliff, Barnett carrying his precious explosives aloft in his arms.\n\n\"Here's the spot,\" said the captain. \"See where the water goes in through\nthose crevices.\"\n\n\"Opening at the top, too,\" said Trendon.\n\nHe let out his bellow, roaring Darrow's name.\n\n\"I doubt if you could project your voice far into a cave thus blocked,\"\nsaid Captain Parkinson. \"We'll try this.\"\n\nHe drew his revolver and fired. The men listened at the crevices of the\nrock. No sound came from within.\n\n\"Your enterprise, Mr. Barnett,\" said the commander, with a gesture which\nturned over the conduct of the affair to the torpedo expert.\n\nBarnett examined the rocks with enthusiasm.\n\n\"Looks like moderately easy stuff,\" he observed. \"See how the veins run.\nYou could almost blow a design to order in that.\"\n\n\"Yes; but how about bringing down the whole cave?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course there's always an element of uncertainty when you're\ndealing with high explosives,\" admitted the expert. \"But unless I'm\nmistaken, we can chop this out as neat as with an axe.\"\n\nDropping his load of cartridges carelessly upon a flat rock which\nprojected from the water, he busied himself in a search along the face of\nthe cliff. Presently, with an \"Ah,\" of satisfaction, he climbed toward a\nhand's breadth of platform where grew a patch of purple flowers.\n\n\"Throw me up a knife, somebody,\" he called.\n\n\"Take notice,\" said Trendon, good-naturedly, \"that I'm the botanist of\nthis expedition.\"\n\n\"Oh, you can have the flowers. All I want is what they grow in.\"\n\nLoosening a handful of the dry soil, he brought it down and laid it with\nthe explosives. Next he called one of the sailors to \"boost\" him, and was\nsoon perched on the flat slant of a huge rock which formed, as it were,\nthe keystone to the blockade.\n\n\"Let's see,\" he ruminated. \"We want a slow charge for this. One that will\nexert a widespread pressure without much shattering force. The No. 3, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"How is that, Mr. Barnett?\" asked the captain, with lively interest.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" returned the demonstrator, perched high, like a sculptor\nat work on some heroic masterpiece, \"what we want is to split off this\nrock.\" He patted the flank of the huge slab. \"There's a lovely vein\nrunning at an angle inward from where I sit. Split that through, and the\nrock should roll, of its own weight, away from the entrance. It's held\nonly by the upper projection that runs under the arch here.\"\n\n\"Neat programme,\" commented Trendon, with a tinge of sardonic scepticism.\n\n\"Wait and see,\" retorted Barnett blithely, for he was in his element now.\n\"I'll appoint you my assistant. Just toss me up that cartridge: the third\none on the left.\"\n\nThe surgeon recoiled.\n\n\"Supposing you don't catch it?\"\n\n\"Well, supposing I don't.\"\n\n\"It's dynamite, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Something of the same nature. Joveite, it's called.\"\n\nStill the surgeon stared at him. Barnett laughed.\n\n\"Oh, you've got the high explosives superstition,\" he said lightly.\n\"Dynamite don't go off as easy as people think. You could drop that stuff\nfrom the cliffhead without danger. Have I got to come down for it?\"\n\nWith a wry face Trendon tossed up the package. It was deftly caught.\n\n\"Now wet that dirt well. Put it in the canvas bag yonder, and send one of\nthe men up with it. I'm going to make a mud pie.\"\n\nBreaking the package open, he spread the yellow powder in a slightly\ncurving line along the rock. With the mud he capped this over, forming a\nlittle arched roof.\n\n\"To keep it from blowing away,\" surmised Trendon.\n\n\"No; to make it blow down instead of blowing up.\"\n\n\"Oh, rot!\" returned the downright surgeon. \"That pound of dirt won't make\nthe shadow of a feather's difference.\"\n\n\"Won't it!\" retorted the other. \"Curious thing about high explosives. A\nmud-cap will hold down the force as well as a ton of rock. Wait and see\nwhat happens to the rock beneath.\"\n\nHe slid off his perch into the ankle-deep water and waded out to the boat.\nHere he burrowed for a moment, presently emerging with a box. This he\ncarried gingerly to a convenient rock and opened. First he lifted out some\nsoft padding. A small tin box honey-combed inside came to light. With\ninfinite precaution Barnett picked out an object that looked like a 22-\ncalibre short cartridge, wadded some cotton batten in his hand, set the\nthing in the wadding, laid it on the rock, carefully returned the small\nbox to the large box and the large box to the boat, took up the cartridge\nagain and waded back to the cliff. They watched him in silence.\n\n\"This is the little devil,\" he said, indicating his delicate burden.\n\"Fulminate of mercury. This is the stuff that'll remove your hand with\nneatness and despatch. It's the quickest tempered little article in the\nbusiness. Just give it one hard look and it's off.\"\n\n\"Here,\" said Trendon, \"I resign. From now on I'm a spectator.\"\n\nBarnett swung the fulminate in his handkerchief and gave it to a sailor to\nhold. The man dandled it like a new-born infant. Back to his rock went\nBarnett. Producing some cord, he let down an end.\n\n\"Tie the handkerchief on, and get out of the way,\" he directed.\n\nWith painful slowness the man carried out the first part of the order; the\nlatter half he obeyed with sprightly alacrity. Very slowly, very\ndelicately, the expert drew in his dangerous burden. Once a current of air\npuffed it against the face of the rock, and the operator's head was\nhastily withdrawn. Nothing happened. Another minute and he had the tiny\nshell in hand. A fuse was fixed in it and it was shoved under the mud-cap.\nBarnett stood up.\n\n\"Will you kindly order the boat ready, Captain Parkinson?\" he called.\n\nThe order was given.\n\n\"As soon as I light the fuse I will come down and we'll pull out fifty\nyards. Leave the rest of the Joveite where it is. All ready? Here goes.\"\n\nHe touched a match to the fuse. It caught. For a moment he watched it.\n\n\"Going all right,\" he reported, as he struck the water. \"Plenty of time.\"\n\nSome seventy yards out they rested on their oars. They waited. And waited.\nAnd waited.\n\n\"It's out,\" grunted Trendon.\n\nFrom the face of the cliff puffed a cloud of dust. A thudding report\nboomed over the water. Just a wisp of whitish-grey smoke arose, and\nbeneath it the great rock, with a gapping seam across its top, rolled\nmajestically outward, sending a shower of spray on all sides, and opening\nto their eager view a black chasm into the heart of the headland. The\nexperiment had worked out with the accuracy of a geometric problem.\n\n\"That's all, sir,\" Barnett reported officially.\n\n\"Magic! Modern magic!\" said the captain. He stared at the open door. For\nthe moment the object of the undertaking was forgotten in the wonder of\nits exact accomplishment.\n\n\"Darrow'll think an earthquake's come after him,\" remarked Trendon.\n\n\"Give way,\" ordered the captain.\n\nThe boat grated on the sand. Captain Parkinson would have entered, but\nBarnett restrained him.\n\n\"It's best to wait a minute or two,\" he advised. \"Occasionally slides\nfollow an explosion tardily, and the gases don't always dissipate\nquickly.\"\n\nWhere they stood they could see but a short way into the cave. Trendon\nsquatted and funnelled his hands to one eye.\n\n[Illustration: \"Sorry not to have met you at the door,\" he said\ncourteously.]\n\n\"There's fire inside,\" he said.\n\nIn a moment they all saw it, a single, pin-point glow, far back in the\nblackness, a Cyclopean eye, that swayed as it approached. Alternately it\nwaned and brightened. Suddenly it illuminated the dim lineaments of a\nface. The face neared them. It joined itself to reality by a very solid\npair of shoulders, and a man sauntered into the twilit mouth of the\ncavern, removed a cigarette from his lips, and gave them greeting.\n\n\"Sorry not to have met you at the door,\" he said, courteously. \"It was you\nthat knocked, was it not? Yes? It roused me from my siesta.\"\n\nThey stared at him in silence. He blinked in the light, with unaccustomed\neyes.\n\n\"You will pardon me for not asking you in at once. Past circumstances have\nrendered me--well--perhaps suspicious is not too strong a word.\"\n\nThey noticed that he held a revolver in his hand.\n\nCaptain Parkinson came forward a step. The host half raised his weapon.\nThen he dropped it abruptly.\n\n\"Navy men!\" he said, in an altered voice. \"I beg your pardon. I could not\nsee at first. My name is Percy Darrow.\"\n\n\"I am Captain Parkinson of the United States cruiser _Wolverine_,\" said\nthe commander. \"This is Mr. Barnett, Mr. Darrow. Dr. Trendon, Mr. Darrow.\"\n\nThey shook hands all around.\n\n\"Like some damned silly afternoon tea,\" Trendon said later, in retailing\nit to the mess. A pause followed.\n\n\"Won't you step in, gentlemen?\" said Darrow, \"May I offer you the makings\nof a cigarette?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you be robbing yourself?\" inquired the captain, with a twinkle.\n\n\"Oh, you found the diary, then,\" said Darrow easily. \"Rather silly of me\nto complain so. But really, in conditions like these, tobacco becomes a\nserious problem.\"\n\n\"So one might imagine,\" said Trendon drily. He looked closely at Darrow.\nThe man's eyes were light and dancing. From the nostrils two livid lines\nran diagonally. Such lines one might make with a hard blue pencil pressed\nstrongly into the flesh. The surgeon moved a little nearer.\n\n\"Can you give me any news of my friend Thrackles?\" asked Darrow lightly.\n\"Or the esteemed Pulz? Or the scholarly and urbane Robinson of Ethiopian\nextraction?\"\n\n\"Dead,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Ah, a pity,\" said the other. He put his hand to his forehead. \"I had\nthought it probable.\" His face twitched. \"Dead? Very good. In fact ...\nreally ... er ... amusing.\"\n\nHe began to laugh, quite to himself. It was not a pleasant laugh to hear.\nTrendon caught and shook him by the shoulder.\n\n\"Drop it,\" he said.\n\nDarrow seemed not to hear him. \"Dead, all dead!\" he repeated. \"And I've\noutlasted 'em! God damn 'em, I've outlasted 'em!\" And his mirth broke\nforth in a strangely shocking spasm.\n\nTrendon lifted a hand and struck him so powerfully between the shoulder\nblades that he all but plunged forward on his face.\n\n\"Quit it!\" he ordered again. \"Get hold of yourself!\"\n\nDarrow turned and gripped him. The surgeon winced with the pain of his\ngrasp. \"I can't,\" gasped the maroon, between paroxysms. \"I've been living\nin hell. A black, shaking, shivering hell, for God knows how long.... What\ndo you know? Have you ever been buried alive?\" And again the agony of\nlaughter shook him.\n\n\"This, then,\" muttered the doctor, and the hypodermic needle shot home.\n\nDuring the return Darrow lay like a log in the bottom of the gig. The\nopiate had done its work. Consciousness was mercifully dead within him.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nTHE SURVIVORS\n\n\nRest and good food quickly brought Percy Darrow back to his normal poise.\nOne inspection satisfied Dr. Trendon that all was well with him. He asked\nto see the captain, and that gentleman came to Ives's room, which had been\nassigned to the rescued man.\n\n\"I hope you've been able to make yourself comfortable,\" said the\ncommander, courteously.\n\n\"It would be strange indeed if I could not,\" returned Darrow, smiling.\n\"You forget that you have set a savage down in the midst of luxury.\"\n\n\"Make yourself free of Ives's things,\" invited Captain Parkinson. \"Poor\nfellow; he will not use them again, I fear.\"\n\n\"One of your men lost?\" asked Darrow. \"Ah, the young officer whose body I\nfound on the beach, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No; but we have to thank you for that burial,\" said the captain.\n\nDarrow made a swift gesture. \"Oh, if thanks are going,\" he cried, and\npaused in hopelessness of adequate expression.\n\n\"This has been a bitter cruise for us,\" continued the captain. He sighed\nand was silent for a moment. \"There is much to tell and to be told,\" he\nresumed.\n\n\"Much,\" agreed the other, gravely.\n\n\"You will want to see Slade first, I presume,\" said the captain.\n\n\"One of your officers whom I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting?\"\n\nThe captain stared. \"Slade,\" he said. \"Ralph Slade.\"\n\n\"Apparently there's a missing link. Or--I fear I was not wholly myself\nyesterday for a time. Possibly something occurred that I did not quite\ntake in.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we'd better wait,\" said Captain Parkinson, with obvious\nmisgiving. \"You're not quite rested. You will feel more like--\"\n\n\"If you don't mind,\" said Darrow composedly, \"I'd like to get at this\nthing now. I'm in excellent understanding, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Very well. I am speaking of the man who acted as mate in the _Laughing\nLass_. The journalist who--good heavens! What arrant stupidity! I have to\nbeg your pardon, Mr. Darrow. It has just occurred to me. He called himself\nEagen with you.\"\n\n\"Eagen! What is this? Is Eagen alive?\"\n\n\"And on this ship. We picked him up in an open boat.\"\n\n\"And you say he calls himself Slade?\"\n\n\"He is Ralph Slade, adventurer and journalist. Mr. Barnett knows him and\nvouches for him.\"\n\n\"And he was on our island under an assumed name,\" said Darrow in tones\nthat had the smoothness and the rasp of silk. \"Rather annoying. Not good\nform, quite, even for a pirate.\"\n\n\"Yet, I believe he saved your life,\" suggested the captain.\n\nDarrow looked up sharply. \"Why, yes,\" he admitted. \"So he did. I had\nhoped--\" He checked himself. \"I had thought that all of the crew went the\nsame way. You didn't find any of the others?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\nDarrow got to his feet. \"I think I'd like to see Eagen--Slade--whatever he\ncalls himself.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" began the captain. \"It might not be--\" He hesitated and\nstopped.\n\nDarrow drew back a little, misinterpreting the other's attitude. \"Do I\nunderstand that I am under restraint?\" he asked stiffly.\n\n\"Certainly not. Why should you be?\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned the other contemplatively, \"it really might be regarded\nas a subject for investigation. Of course I know only a small part of it.\nBut there have certainly been suspicious circumstances. Piracy there has\nbeen: no doubt of that. Murder, too, if my intuitions are not at fault. Or\nat least, a disappearance to be accounted for. Robbery can't be denied.\nAnd there's a dead body or two to be properly accredited.\" He looked the\ncaptain in the eye.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You'll find my story highly unsatisfactory in detail, I fancy. I merely\nwant to know whether I'm to present it as a defence, or only an\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"We shall be glad to hear your story when you are ready to tell it--after\nyou have seen Mr. Slade.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Darrow simply. \"You have heard his?\"\n\n\"Yes. It needs filling in.\"\n\n\"When may I see him?\"\n\n\"That's for Dr. Trendon to say. He came to us almost dead. I'll find out.\"\n\nThe surgeon reported Slade much better, but all a-quiver with excitement.\n\n\"Hate to put the strain on him,\" said he. \"But he'll be in a fever till he\ngets this thing off his mind. Send Mr. Darrow to him.\"\n\nAfter a moment's consideration Darrow said: \"I should like to have you and\nDr. Trendon present, Captain Parkinson, while I ask Eagen one or two\nquestions.\"\n\n\"Understand one thing, Mr. Darrow,\" said Trendon briefly. \"This is not to\nbe an inquisition.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Darrow, unmoved. \"I'm to be neither defendant nor prosecutor.\"\n\n\"You are to respect the condition of Dr. Trendon's patient, sir,\" said\nCaptain Parkinson, with emphasis. \"Outside of that, your attitude toward a\nman who has twice thought of your life before his own is for you to\ndetermine.\"\n\nNo little cynicism lurked in Darrow's tones as he said:\n\n\"You have confidence in Mr. Slade, alias Eagen.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Captain Parkinson, in a tone that closed that topic.\n\n\"Still, I should be glad to have you gentlemen present, if only for a\nmoment,\" insisted Darrow, presently.\n\n\"Perhaps it would be as well--on account of the patient,\" said the surgeon\nsignificantly.\n\n\"Very well,\" assented the captain.\n\nThe three went to Slade's cabin. He was lying propped up in his bunk.\nTrendon entered first, followed by the captain, then Darrow.\n\n\"Here's your prize, Slade,\" said the surgeon.\n\nDarrow halted, just inside the door. With an eager light in his face Slade\nleaned forward and stretched out his hand.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it until I saw you, old man,\" he cried.\n\nDarrow's eyebrows went up. Before Slade had time to note that there was no\nresponse to his outstretched hand, the surgeon had jumped in and pushed\nhim roughly back upon his pillow.\n\n\"What did you promise?\" he growled. \"You were to lie still, weren't you?\nAnd you'll do it, or out we go.\"\n\n\"How are you, Eagen?\" drawled Darrow.\n\n\"Not Eagen. I'm done with that. They've told you, haven't they?\"\n\nDarrow nodded. \"Are you the only survivor?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Except yourself.\"\n\n\"The <DW65>? Pulz? Thrackles? The captain? All drowned?\"\n\n\"Not the captain. They murdered him.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Darrow softly. \"And you--I beg your pardon--your--er--friends\ndisposed of the doctor in the same way?\"\n\n\"Handy Solomon,\" replied Slade with shaking lips. \"Hell's got that fiend,\nif there's a hell for human fiends. They threw the doctor's body in the\nsurf.\"\n\n\"You didn't notice whether there were any papers?\"\n\n\"If there were they must have been destroyed with the body when the lava\npoured down the valley into the sea.\"\n\n\"The lava: of course,\" assented Darrow, with elaborate nonchalance. \"Well,\nhe was a kind old boy. A cheerful, simple, wise old child.\"\n\n\"I would have given my right hand to save him,\" cried Slade. \"It was so\nsudden--so damnable--\"\n\n\"Better to have saved him than me,\" said Darrow. He spoke with the first\ntouch of feeling that he exhibited. \"I have to thank you for my life,\nEagen--I beg your pardon: Slade. It's hard to remember.\"\n\nDr. Trendon arose, and Captain Parkinson with him.\n\n\"Give you two hours, Mr. Darrow,\" said the surgeon. \"No more. If he seems\nexhausted, give him one of these powders. I'll look in in an hour.\"\n\nAt the end of an hour he returned. Slade was lying back on his pillow.\nDarrow was talking, eagerly, confidentially. In another hour he came out.\n\n\"The whole thing is clear,\" he said to Captain Parkinson. \"I am ready to\nreport to you.\"\n\n\"This evening,\" said the captain. \"The mess will want to hear.\"\n\n\"Yes, they will want to hear,\" assented Darrow. \"You've had Slade's story.\nI'll take it up where he left off, and he'll check me. Mine's as\nincredible as--as Slade's was. And it's as true.\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nTHE MAKER OF MARVELS\n\n\nAs they had gathered to hear Ralph Slade's tale, so now the depleted mess\nof the _Wolverine_ grouped themselves for Percy Darrow's sequel. Slade\nhimself sat directly across from the doctor's assistant. Before him lay a\npaper covered with jotted notes. Trendon slouched low in the chair on\nSlade's right. Captain Parkinson had the other side. Convenient to\nDarrow's hand lay the material for cigarettes. As he talked he rolled\ncylinder after cylinder, and between sentences consumed them in long,\nsatisfying puffs.\n\n\"First you will want to learn of the fate of your friends and shipmates,\"\nhe began. \"They are dead. One of them, Mr. Edwards, fell to my hands to\nbury, as you know. He lies beside Handy Solomon. The others we shall\nprobably not see: any one of a score of ocean currents may have swept them\nfar away. The last great glow that you saw was the signal of their\ndestruction. So the work of a great scientist, a potent benefactor of the\nrace, a gentle and kindly old heart, has brought about the death of your\nfriends and of my enemies. The innocent and the guilty ... the murderer\nwith his plunder, the officer following his duty ... one and the same\nend ... a paltry thing our vaunted science is in the face of such tangled\nfates.\" He spoke low and bitterly. Then he squared his shoulders and his\nmanner became businesslike.\n\n\"Interrupt me when any point needs clearing up,\" he said. \"It's a blind\ntrail at best. You've the right to see it as plain as I can make it--with\nSlade's help. Cut right in with your questions: There'll be plenty to\nanswer and some never will be answered....\n\n\"Now let me get this thing laid out clearly in my own mind. You first saw\nthe glow--let me see--\"\n\n\"Night of June 2d,\" said Barnett.\n\n\"June 2d,\" agreed Darrow. \"That was the end of Solomon, Thrackles & Co. A\nvery surprising end to them, if they had time to think,\" he added grimly.\n\n\"Surprising enough, from the survivor's viewpoint,\" said Slade.\n\n\"Doubtless. They've had that story from you; I needn't go over it. This\nship picked up the _Laughing Lass_, deserted, and put your first crew\naboard. That night, was it not, you saw the second pillar of fire?\"\n\nBarnett nodded.\n\n\"So your men met their death. Then came the second finding of the empty\nschooner.... Captain Parkinson, they must have been brave men who faced\nthe unknown terrors of that prodigy.\"\n\n\"They volunteered, sir,\" said the Captain, with simple pride.\n\nDarrow bowed with a suggestion of reverence in the slow movement of his\nhead. \"And that night--or was it two nights later?--you saw the last\nappearance of the portent. Well, I shall come to that.... Slade has told\nyou how they lived on the beach. With us in the valley it was different.\nAlmost from the first I was alone. The doctor ceased to be a companion. He\nceased to be human, almost. A machine, that's what he was. His one human\ninstinct was--well, distrust. His whole force of being was centred on his\ndiscovery. It was to make him the foremost scientist of the world; the\nforemost individual entity of his time--of all time, possibly. Even to\noutline it to you would take too much time. Light, heat, motive power in\nincredible degrees and under such control as has never been known: these\nwere to be the agencies at his call. The push of a button, the turn of a\nscrew--oh, he was to be master of such power as no monarch ever wielded!\nRiches--pshaw! Riches were the least of it. He could create them,\npractically. But they would be superfluous. Power: unlimited, absolute\npower was his goal. With his end achieved he could establish an autocracy,\na dynasty of science: whatever he chose. Oh, it was a rich-hued, golden,\nglowing dream; a dream such as men's souls don't formulate in these stale\ndays--not our kind of men. The Teutonic mysticism--you understand. And it\nwas all true. Oh, quite.\"\n\n\"Do you mean us to understand that he had this power you describe?\" asked\nCaptain Parkinson.\n\n\"In his grasp. Then comes a practical gentleman with a steel hook. A\nfollower of dreams, too, in his way. Conflicting interests--you know how\nit is. One well-aimed blow from the more practical dreamer, and the\ngreater vision passes.... I'm getting ahead of myself. Just a moment.\"\n\nHis cigarette glowed fiercely in the dimness before he took up his tale\nagain.\n\n\"You all know who Dr. Schermerhorn was. None of you know--I don't know\nmyself, though I've been his factotum for ten years--along how many varied\nlines of activity that mind played. One of them was the secret of energy:\nconcentrated, resistless energy. Man's contrivances were too puny for him.\nThe most powerful engines he regarded as toys. For a time high explosives\nclaimed his attention. He wanted to harness them. Once he got to the point\nof practical experiment. You can see the ruins yet: a hole in southern New\nJersey. Nobody ever understood how he escaped. But there he was on his\nfeet across a ten-foot fence in a ploughed field--yes, he flew the fence--\nand running, running furiously in the opposite direction, when the dust\ncleared away. Someone stopped him finally. Told him the danger was over.\n'Yet, I will not return,' he said firmly, and fainted away. That disgusted\nhim with high explosives. What secrets he discovered he gave to the\ngovernment. They were not without value, I believe.\"\n\n\"They were not, indeed,\" corroborated Barnett.\n\n\"Next his interest turned to the natural phenomena of high energy. He\nstudied lightning in an open steel network laboratory, with few results\nsave a succession of rheumatic attacks, and an improved electric\ninterrupter, since adopted by one of the great telegraph companies. The\nformer obliged him to stop these experiments, and the invention he\nconsidered trivial. Probably the great problem of getting at the secret of\nenergy led him into his attempts to study the mysterious electrical waves\nradiated by lightning flashes; at any rate he was soon as deep into the\nsubject of electrical science as his countryman, Hertz, had ever been. He\nused to tell me that he often wondered why he hadn't taken up this line\nbefore--the world of energy he now set out to explore, waves in that\ntremendous range between those we hear and those we see. It was natural\nthat he should then come to the most prominent radio-active elements,\nuranium, thorium, and radium. But though his knowledge surpassed that of\nthe much-exploited authorities, he was never satisfied with any of his\nresults.\n\n\"'Pitchblende; no!' he would exclaim. 'It has not the great power. The\nmines are not deep enough, yet!'\n\n\"Then suddenly the great idea that was to bring him success, and cost him\nhis life, came to him. The bowels of the earth must hold the secret! He\ntook up volcanoes.... Does all this sound foolish? It was not if you knew\nthe man. He was a mighty enthusiast, a born martyr. Not cold-blooded, like\nthe rest of us. The fire was in his veins.... A light, please. Thank you.\n\n\"We chased volcanoes. There was a theory under it all. He believed that\nvolcanic emanations are caused by a mighty and uncomprehended energy,\nsomething that achieves results ascribable neither to explosions nor heat,\nsome eternal, inner source.... Radium, if you choose, only he didn't call\nit that. Radium itself, as known to our modern scientists, he regarded as\nthe harmless plaything of people with time hanging heavy on their hands.\nHe wasn't after force in pin-point quantities: he wanted bulk results. Yet\nI believe that, after all, what he sought was a sort of higher power of\nradium. The phenomena were related. And he had some of that concentrated\nessence of pitchblende in the chest when we started. Oh, not much: say\nabout twenty thousand dollars' worth. Maybe thirty. For use? No; rather\nfor comparison, I judge.\n\n\"Yes, we chased volcanoes. I became used to camping between sample hells\nof all known varieties. I got so that the fumes of a sulphur match seemed\nlike a draught of pure, fresh air. Wherever any of the earth's pimples\nshowed signs of coming to a head, there were we, taking part in the\ntrouble. By and by the doctor got so thoroughly poisoned that he had to\nlay off. Back to Philadelphia we came. There an aged seafaring person,\ntemporarily stranded, mulcted the Professor of a dollar--an undertaking\nthat required no art--and in the course of his recital touched upon yonder\nlittle cesspool of infernal iniquities. An uncharted volcanic island: one\nthat he could have all for his own; you may guess whether Dr. Schermerhorn\nwas interested.\n\n\"'That iss for which we haf so-long-in-vain sought, Percy,' he said to me\nin his quaint, link-chain style of speech. 'A leedle prifate volcano-\nlaboratory to ourselves to have. Totally unknown: undescribed, not-on-the-\nchart-to-be-found. To-morrow we start. I make a list of the things-to-\nget.'\n\n\"He began his list, as I remember, with three dozen undershirts, a gallon\nof pennyroyal for insect bites, a box of assorted fish hooks, thirty\npounds of tea, and a case of carpet tacks. When I hadn't anything else to\nworry over, I used to lie awake at night and speculate on the purpose of\nthose carpet tacks. He had something in mind: if there was anything on\nwhich he prided himself, it was his practical bent. But the list never got\nany further: it ceased short of one page in the ledger, as you may have\nnoticed. I outfitted by telegraph on the way across the continent.\n\n\"The doctor didn't ask me whether I'd go. He took it for granted. That's\nprobably why I didn't back out. Nor did I tell him that the three life\ninsurance companies which had foolishly and trustingly accepted me as a\nrisk merely on the strength of a good constitution were making frantic\nefforts to compromise on the policies. They felt hurt, those companies: my\nhealthy condition had ceased to appeal to them. What's a good constitution\nbetween earthquakes? No, there was no use telling the doctor. It would\nonly have worried him. Besides, I didn't believe that the island was\nthere. I thought it was a myth of that stranded ancient mariner's\nimagination. When it rose to sight at the proper spot, none were more\nastounded than the bad risk who now addresses you.\n\n\"Yet, I must say for the island that it came handsomely up to\nspecifications. Down where you were, Slade. you didn't get a real insight\ninto its disposition. But in back of us there was any kind of action for\nyour money. Geysers, hell-spouts, fuming fissures, cunning little\ncraterlets with half-portions of molten lava ready to serve hot; more\ngases than you could create in all the world's chemical laboratories: in\nfact, everything to make the place a paradise for Old Nick--and Dr.\nSchermerhorn. He brought along in his precious chest, besides the radium,\nsome sort of raw material: also, as near as I could make out, a sort of\ncage or guardianship scheme for his concentrated essence of cussedness,\nwhen he should get it out of the volcano.\n\n\"In the first seven months he puttered around the little fumers, with an\noccasional excursion up to the main crater. It was my duty to follow on\nand drag him away when he fell unconscious. Sometimes I would try to get\nhim before he was quite gone. Then he would become indignant, and fight\nme. Perhaps that helped to lose me his confidence. More and more he\nwithdrew into himself. There were days when he spoke no word to me. It was\nlonely. Do you know why I used to visit you at the beach, Slade? I suppose\nyou thought I was keeping watch on you. It wasn't that, it was loneliness.\nIn a way, it hurt me, too: for one couldn't help but be fond of the old\nboy; and at times it seemed as if he weren't quite himself. Pardon me, if\nI may trouble you for the matches? Thanks....\n\n\"Matters went very wrong at times: the doctor fumed like his little\ncraters; growled out long-winded, exhaustive German imprecations: wouldn't\neven eat. Then again the demon of work would drive him with thong and\nspur: he would rush to his craters, to his laboratories, to his ledger for\nthe purpose of entering unintelligible commentaries. He had some peculiar\ncontrivance, like a misshapen retort, with which he collected gases from\nthe craterlets. Whenever I'd hear one of those smash, I knew it was a bad\nday.\n\n\"Meantime, the volcano also became--well, what you might call\ntemperamental.\n\n\"It got to be a year and a quarter--a year and a half. I wondered whether\nwe should ever get away. My tobacco was running short. And the bearing of\nthe men was becoming fidgetty. My visits to the beach became quite\ninteresting--to me. One day the doctor came running out of his laboratory\nwith so bright a face that I ventured to ask him about departure.\n\n\"'Not so long, now, Percy,' he said, in his old, kind manner. 'Not so\nlong. The first real success. It iss made. We have yet under-entire-\ncontrol to bring it, but it iss made.'\n\n\"'And about time, sir,' said I. 'If we don't do something soon we may have\ntrouble with the men.'\n\n\"'So?' said he in surprise. 'But they could do nothing. Nothing.' He\nwagged his great head confidently. 'We are armed.'\n\n\"'Oh, yes, armed. So are they.'\n\n\"'We are armed,' he repeated obstinately. 'Such as no man was ever armed,\nare we armed.'\n\n\"He checked himself abruptly and walked away. Well, I've since wondered\nwhat would have happened had the men attacked us. It would have been worth\nseeing, and--and surprising. Yes: I'm quite certain it would have been\nsurprising. Perhaps, too, I might have learned more of the Great\nSecret ... and yet, I don't know. It's all dark ... a hint\nhere ... theory ... mere glints of light.... Where did I put.... Ah,\nthank you.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE ACHIEVEMENT\n\n\nFor some moments Darrow sat gazing fixedly at the table before him. His\ncigarette tip glowed and failed. Someone suggested drinks. The captain\nasked Darrow what he would have, but the question went unnoted.\n\n\"How I passed the next six months I could hardly tell you,\" he began\nagain, quite abruptly. \"At times I was bored--fearfully bored. Yet the\nelement of mystery, of uncertainty, of underlying peril, gave a certain\nzest to the affair. In the periods of dulness I found some amusement in\nvisiting the lower camp and baiting the <DW65>. Slade will have told you\nabout him; he possessed quite a fund of bastard Voodooism: he possessed\nmore before I got through with him. Yes; if he had lived to return to his\ncountry, I fancy he would have added considerably to Afro-American witch-\nlore. You remember the vampire bats, Slade? And the devil-fires? Naturally\nI didn't mention to you that the devil-fire business wasn't altogether as\nclear to me as I pretended. It wasn't, though. But at the time it served\nvery well as an amusement. All the while I realised that my self-\nentertainment was not without its element of danger, too: I remember\nglances not altogether friendly but always a little doubtful, a little\nawed. Even Handy Solomon, practical as he was, had a scruple or two of\nsuperstition in his make-up, on which one might work. Only Eagen--Slade, I\nmean--was beyond me there. You puzzled me not a little in those days,\nSlade. Well....\n\n\"Did I say that I was sometimes annoyed by the doctor's attitude? Yes: it\nseemed that he might have given me a little more of his confidence; but\none can't judge such a man as he was. Among the ordinary affairs of life\nhe had relied on me for every detail. Now he was independent of me.\nIndependent! I doubt if he remembered my existence at times. Even in his\nblackest moods of depression he was sufficient unto himself. It was\nstrange.... How he did rage the day the chemicals from Washington went\nwrong! I was washing my shirt in the hot water spring when he came bolting\nout of the laboratory and keeled me over. I came out pretty indignant.\nApologise? Not at all. He just sputtered. His nearest approach to\ncoherence seemed to indicate a desire that I should go back to Washington\nat once and destroy a perfectly reputable firm of chemists. Finally he\ncalmed down and took it out in entering it in his daily record. He was\nquite proud of that daily record and remembered to write in it on an\naverage of once a week.\n\n\"Then the chest went wrong. Whether it had rusted a bit, or whether the\nchemicals had got in their work on the hinges, I don't know; but one day\nthe Professor, of his own initiative, recognised my existence by lugging\nhis box out in the open and asking me to fix it. Previously he had emptied\nit. It was rather a complicated thing, with an inner compartment over\nwhich was a hollow cover, opening along one rim. That, I conjectured, was\ndesigned to hold some chemical compound or salt. There were many minor\nopenings, too, each guarded by a similar hollow door. My business was with\nthe heavy top cover.\n\n\"'It should shut and open softly, gently,' explained the Professor. 'So.\nNot with-a-grating-sound-to-be-accompanied,' he added, with his curious\neffect of linked phraseology.\n\n\"Half a day's work fixed it. The lid would stand open of itself until\ntipped at a considerable angle, when it would fall and lock. Only on the\nouter shell was there a lock: that one was a good bit of craftsmanship.\n\n\"'So, Percy, my boy,' said the doctor kindly. 'That will with-sufficient-\nsafety guard our treasure. When we obtain it, Percy. When it entirely-\nfinished-and-completed shall be.'\n\n\"'And when will that be?' I asked.\n\n\"'God knows,' he said cheerfully. 'It progresses.'\n\n\"Whenever I went strolling at night, he would produce his curious lights.\nSometimes they were fairly startling. One fact I made out by accident,\nlooking down from a high place. They did not project from the laboratory.\nHe always worked in the open when the light was to be produced. Once the\nexperiment took a serious turn. The lights had flickered and gone. Dr.\nSchermerhorn had returned to his laboratory. I came up the arroyo as he\nflung the door open and rushed out. He was a grotesque figure, clad in an\nundershirt and a worn pair of trousers, fastened with an old bit of tarred\nrope in lieu of his suspenders, which I had been repairing. About his\nwaist flickered a sort of aura of radiance which was extinguished as he\nflung himself headforemost into the cold spring. I hauled him out. He\nseemed dazed. To my questions he replied only by mumblings, the burden of\nwhich was:\n\n\"'I do not understand. It is a not-to-be-comprehended accident.' It\nappears that he didn't quite know why he had taken to the water. Or if he\ndid, he didn't want to tell.\n\n\"Next day he was as good as new. Just as silent as before, but it was a\nsmiling, satisfied silence. So it went for weeks, for months, with the\naccesses of depression and anger always rarer. Then came an afternoon\nwhen, returning from a stalk after sheep, I heard strange and shocking\nnoises from the laboratory. Strict as was the embargo which kept me\noutside the door, I burst in, only to be seized in a suffocating grip. Of\na sudden I realised that I was being embraced. The doctor flourished a\nhand above my head and jigged with ponderous steps. The dismal noises\ncontinued to emanate from his mouth. He was singing. I wish I could give\nyou a notion of the amazement, the paralysing wonder with which.... No,\nyou did not know Dr. Schermerhorn: you would not understand....\n\n\"We polkaed into the open. There he cast me loose. He stopped singing and\nburst into a rhapsody of disjointed words. Mostly German, it was--a\nwondrous jumble of the scientific and poetic. 'Eureka' occurred at\nintervals. Then he would leap in the air. It was weird, it was\ndistressing. Crazy? Oh, quite. For the time, you understand. If any of us\nshould suddenly become the most potent individual in the world, wouldn't\nhe be apt to lose balance temporarily? One must make allowances. There was\nexcuse for the doctor. He had reached the goal.\n\n\"'Percy, you shall be rewarded,' he said. 'You haf like-a-trump-card stuck\nby me. You shall haf riches, gold, what you will. You are young; your\nblood runs red. With such riches nothing is beyond you. You could the\nancient-tombs-of-Egypt explore. It is open to you such collections-as-\nhave-never-been-gathered to make. What shall it be? Scarabs? Missals?\nPrehistoric implements? Amuse yourself, _mein kind_. We shall be able the-\nbills-with-usurious-interest to pay. What will you haf?'\n\n\"I said I'd like a vacation, if convenient.\n\n\"'Presently,' he replied. 'There yet remains the guardianship to be\nperfected. Then to-a-world-astonished-and-respectful we return. To-night\nwe celebrate. I play you a rubber of pinochle.'\n\n\"We played. With the greatest secret of science resting at our elbows, we\nplayed. The doctor won; my mind was not strictly on the game. In the\nmorning the doctor sang once more.... I shall never hear its like again.\nWas it a week, or a month, after that?... I cannot remember. I fancy I was\nexcited. Then, too, there was something in the atmosphere about the\nlaboratory ... I don't know; imagination, possibly. Once we had a little\nmanifestation: the night that the <DW65> and Slade were terrified by the\nrock fires. Days of excitement and pleasant work, with the little volcano\ngrumbling more sulkily all the time ... I have spent worse days.\n\n\"Such indifference as the doctor displayed toward the volcano I have never\nknown. If I ventured to warn him he would assure me that there was no\ncause for alarm. I think he regarded that little hell's kitchen as merely\na feed-spout for his vast enterprise. He felt a sort of affection toward\nit; he was tolerant of its petty fits of temper. That he completed his\nwork before the destruction came was sheer luck. Nothing else. The day\nbefore the outburst he came to me with a tiny phial of complicated design.\n\n\"'Percy, I will at-a-reasonable-price sell this to you,' he said.\n\n\"'How much?' I inquired, responding to his playfulness.\n\n\"'A bargain,' he cried gaily. 'Five millions dollars. No! Shall I upon-a-\nneedy-friend hard-press? Never. One million. One little million dollars.'\n\n\"'I haven't that amount with me,' I began.\n\n\"'Of no account,' he declared airily. 'Soon we shall haf many more times\nas that. Gif me your C.O. D.'\n\n\"'My I. O. U.?' I inquired.\n\n\"'It makes no matter. See. I will gif it to you gratis.'\n\n\"He handed me the metal contrivance. It was closed.\n\n\"'Inside iss a little, such a very little. Not yet iss it arranged the\nmotive-power to give-forth. One more change-to-be-made that shall require.\nBut the other phenomena are all in this little half-grain comprised. Later\nI shall tell you more. Take it. It iss without price.' He laid his hand on\nmy shoulder. 'Like the love of friends,' he said gently.\"\n\nFeeling in his upper waistcoat pocket, Darrow brought out a phial, so tiny\nthat it rolled in the palm of his hand. He contemplated it, lost in\nthought.\n\n\"Radium?\" queried Barnett, with the keen interest of the scientist.\n\n\"God knows what it is,\" said Darrow, rousing himself. \"Not the perfected\nproduct; the doctor said that when he gave it to me. If I could remember\none-tenth of what he told me that night! It is like a disordered dream, a\nphantasmagoria of monstrous powers, lit up with an intolerable, almost an\ninfernal radiance. This much I did gather: that Dr. Schermerhorn had\nachieved what the greatest minds before him had barely outlined. Yes, and\nmore. Becquerel, the Curies, Rutherford--they were playing with the\nletters of the Greek alphabet, Alphas, Gammas, and Rhos, while the simple,\ngentle old boy that I served had read the secret. From the molten\neruptions of the racked earth he had taken gases and potencies that are\nnameless. By what methods of combination and refining I do not know, he\nproduced something that was to be the final word of power. Control--\ncontrol--that was all that lacked.\n\n\"Reduced to its simplest terms, it meant this: the doctor had something as\nmuch greater than radium as radium is greater than the pitchblende of\nwhich a thousand tons are melted down to the one ounce of extract. And the\nincredible energies of this he proposed to divide into departments of\nactivity. One manifestation should be light, a light that would illuminate\nthe world. Another was to make motive power so cheap that the work of the\nworld could be done in an hour out of the day. Some idea he had of healing\nproperties. Yes; he was to cure mankind. Or kill, kill as no man had ever\nkilled, did he choose. The armies and navies of the powers would be at his\nmercy. Magnetism was to be his slave. Aerial navigation, transmutation of\nmetals, the screening of gravity--does this sound like delirium? Sometimes\nI think it was.\n\n\"That night he turned over to me the key of the large chest and his\nledger. The latter he bade me read. It was a complete jumble. You have\nseen it.... We were up a good part of the night with our pet volcano. It\nwas suffering from internal disturbances. 'So,' the doctor would say\nindulgently, when a particularly active rock came bounding down our way.\n'Little play-antics-to-exhibit now that the work iss finished.'\n\n\"In the morning he insisted on my leaving him alone and going down to give\nthe orders. I took the ledger, intending to send it aboard. It saved my\nlife possibly: Solomon's bullet deflected slightly, I think, in passing\nthrough the heavy paper. Slade has told you about my flight. I ought to\nhave gone straight up the arroyo.... Yet I could hardly have made it.... I\ndid not see him again, the doctor. My last glimpse ... the old man--I\nremember now how the grey had spread through his beard--he was growing\nold--it had been ageing labour. He stood there at his laboratory door and\nthe mountain spouted and thundered behind.\n\n\"'We will a name-to-suit-properly gif it,' he said, as I left him. 'It\nshall make us as the gods. We will call it celestium.'\n\n\"I left him there smiling. Smiling happily. The greatest force of his\nage--if he had lived. Very wise, very simple--a kind old child. May I\ntrouble you for a light? Thanks.\"\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHE DOOM\n\n\n\"Nothing remained but to search for his body. I was sure they had killed\nhim and taken the chest. I had little expectation of finding him, dead or\nalive. None after I saw the stream of lava pouring into the sea. One saves\nhis own life by instinct, I suppose. There I was. I had to live. It did\nnot matter much, but I continued to do it by various shifts. That last day\non the headland the fumes nearly got me. You may have noted the rather\nexcited scrawl in the back of the ledger? Yes, I thought I was gone that\ntime. But I got to the cave. It was low tide. Then the earthquake, and I\nwas walled in.... Mr. Barnett's very accurate explosives--Slade's\ninsistence--your risking your lives as you did, mites on the crust of a\nred-hot cheese--I hope you know how I feel about it all. One can't thank a\nman properly for the life....\n\n\"Oh, the pirates. Necessarily it must be a matter of theory, but I think\nwe have it right. Slade and I built it up. For what it's worth, here it\nis. Let me see: you sighted the glow on the night of the 2d. Next day came\nthe deserted ship. It must have puzzled you outrageously.\"\n\n\"It did,\" said Captain Parkinson, drily.\n\n\"Not an easy problem, even with all the data at hand. You, of course, had\nnone. On Slade's showing, Handy Solomon and his worthy associates thought\nthey had a chest full of riches when they got the doctor's treasure;\nbelieved they owned the machinery for making diamonds or gold or what-not\nof ready-to-hand wealth. It's fair to assume a certain eagerness on their\npart. Disturbed weather keeps them busy until they're well out from the\nisland. Then to the chest. Opening it isn't so easy: I had the key, you\nknow.\" He brought a curious and delicately wrought skeleton from his\npocket. \"Tipped with platinum,\" he observed. \"Rather a gem of a key, I\nthink. You see, there must have been some action, even through the\nkeyhole, or he wouldn't have used a metal of this kind. But the crew was\nrich in certain qualities, it seems, which I failed, stupidly, to\nrecognise in my acquaintance with them. Both Pulz and Perdosa appear to\nhave been handy men where locks were concerned. First Pulz sneaks down and\nhas his turn at the chest. He gets it open. Small profit for him in that:\nthe next we know of him he is scandalising Handy Solomon by having a fit\non the deck.\"\n\n\"That is what I couldn't figure out to save my life,\" said Slade eagerly.\n\n\"If you recollect, I told you of the Professor's plunge in the cold\nspring, in a sort of paroxysm, one day,\" said Darrow. \"That was the\nphysiological action of the celestium. At other times, I have seen him\ncome out and deliberately roll in the creek, head under. Once he explained\nthat the medium he worked in caused a kind of uncontrollable longing for\nwater; something having none of the qualities of burning or thirst, but an\nirresistible temporary mania. It worried him a good deal; he didn't\nunderstand it. That, then, was what ailed Pulz. When he opened the chest\nthere was, as I surmise, a trifling quantity of this stuff lying in the\ninner lid. It wasn't the celestium itself, as I imagine, but a sort of by-\nproduct with the physiological and radiant effects of the real thing, and\nit had been set there on guard, a discouragement to the spirit of\ninvestigation, as it were. So, when the top was lifted, our little\nguardian gets in its work, producing the light phenomenon that so puzzled\nSlade, and inspiring Pulz with a passion for the rolling wave, which is\nonly interrupted by Handy Solomon's tackling him. As he fled he must have\npulled down the cover.\"\n\n\"He did,\" said Slade. \"I heard the clang. But I saw the radiance on the\nclouds. And the whole thickness of a solid oak deck was in between the sky\nand the chest.\"\n\n\"Oh, a little thing like an oak deck wouldn't interrupt the kind of rays\nthe doctor used. He had his own method of screening, you understand.\nHowever, this inconsiderable guardian affair must have used itself up,\nwhich true celestium wouldn't have done. So when Perdosa sets his genius\nfor lock-picking to the task, the inner box, full of the genuine article,\nhas no warning sign-post, so to speak. Everything's peaceful until they\nraise the compound-filled hollow layer of the inner cover, which serves to\ninterrupt the action. Then comes the general exit and the superior\nfireworks.\"\n\n\"That's when the rays ran through the ship,\" said Slade. \"It seemed to\nfollow the deck-lines.\"\n\n\"The stuff had a strange affinity for tar,\" said Darrow. \"I told you of\nthe circle of fire about Professor Schermerhorn's waist the day he gave me\nsuch a scare. That was the celestium working on the tarred rope he wore\nfor a belt. It made a livid circle on his skin. Did I tell you of his\nexperiments with pitch? It doesn't matter. Where was I?\"\n\n\"At the place where we all jumped,\" said Slade.\n\n\"Oh, yes. And you dove into the small boat, trying to reach the water.\"\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" said Barnett. \"If that was the exhibition of radiance we\nsaw, it died out in a few minutes. How was that? Did they close the chest\nbefore they ran?\"\n\n\"Probably not,\" replied Darrow. \"Slade spoke of Pulz taking to the maintop\nand being shaken out by the sudden shock of a wave. That may have been a\nvolcanic billow. Whatever it was, it undoubtedly heeled the ship\nsufficiently to bring down both lids, which were rather delicately\nbalanced.\"\n\n\"Yes, for Billy Edwards found the chest closed and locked,\" said Barnett.\n\n\"Of course; it was a spring lock. You sent Mr. Edwards and his men aboard.\nNo such experts as Pulz or Perdosa were in your crew. Consequently it took\nlonger to get the chest open. When at length the lid was raised, there was\na repetition of the tragedy. Mr. Edwards and his men leaped. Probably they\nwere paralysed almost before they struck the water. Your bos'n, whom Slade\npicked up, was the only one who had time even to grab a life preserver\nbefore the impulse toward water became irresistible. There was no element\nof fright, you understand: no desertion of their post. They were dragged\nas by the sweep of a tornado.\" Darrow spoke direct to Captain Parkinson.\n\"If there is any feeling among you other than sorrow for their death, it\nis unjust and unworthy.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Darrow,\" returned the captain quietly.\n\n\"We found the chest closed again when the empty ship came back,\" observed\nBarnett.\n\n\"Being masterless, the schooner began to yaw,\" continued Darrow. \"The\nfirst time she came about would have heeled her enough to shut the chest.\nNow came the turn of your other men.\"\n\n\"Ives and McGuire,\" said the Captain, as Darrow paused.\n\n\"The glow came again that night, and the next day we picked up Slade,\"\nsaid Barnett.\n\n\"You know what the glow meant for your companions,\" said Darrow.\n\n\"But the ship. The _Laughing Lass_, man. She's vanished. No one has seen\nher since.\"\n\n\"You are wrong there,\" said Darrow. \"I have seen her.\"\n\nIn a common impulse the little circle leaned to him.\n\n\"Yes, I have seen her. I wish I had not. Let me bring my story back to the\ncave on the island. After the volcanic gases had driven me to the refuge,\nI sat near the mouth of the cave looking out into the darkness. That was\nthe night of the 7th, the night you saw the last glow. It was very dark,\nexcept for occasional bursts of fire from the crater. Judge of my\nincredulous amazement when, in an access of this illumination, I saw\nplainly a schooner hardly a mile off shore, coming in under bare poles.\"\n\n\"Under bare poles?\" cried Slade.\n\n\"The halliards must have disintegrated from some slow action of the\ncelestium. It could be destructive: terrifically destructive. You shall\njudge. There was the schooner, naked as your hand. Possibly I might have\nthought it a hallucination but for what came after. Darkness fell again. I\nsupposed then that Handy Solomon's crew were managing--or mismanaging--the\n_Laughing Lass_ without the aid of their leader, whom I had satisfactorily\nburied. I hoped they would come ashore on the rocks. Yes I was\nvengeful ... then.\n\n\"Of a sudden there sprang from the darkness a ship of light. You have all\nseen those great electric effects at expositions. Someone touches a\nbutton ... you know. It was like that. Only that the piercingly brilliant\njewelled wonder of a ship was set in the midst of a swirl of vari-\nradiance such as I can't begin to describe. You saw it from a distance.\nImagine what it was, coming close upon you that way--dead on, out of the\nnight. A living glory, a living terror....\"\n\nHis voice sank. With a shaking hand he fumbled amid his cigarette papers.\n\n\"It came on. A human figure, glowing like a diamond ablaze, leaped out\nfrom it; another shot down from the foremast. I don't know how many I saw\ngo. It was like a theatric effect, unreal, unconvincing, incredible. The\nend fitted it.\"\n\nDarrow's eye roved. It fell upon a quaintly modelled ship, hung above the\ndoor.\n\n\"What's that?\" he cried.\n\n\"Fool thing some Malay gave me,\" grunted Trendon. \"Pretended to be\ngrateful because I cut his foot off. No good. Go on with the story.\"\n\n\"No good? You don't care what happens to it?\"\n\n\"Meant to heave it overboard before now,\" growled the other.\n\nSomeone handed it down to Darrow.\n\n\"If I had something to hold enough water,\" muttered he, \"I'd like to float\nit. I'd like to see for myself how it worked out. I'd like to see that\ndevil-work in action.\"\n\nHe spoke feverishly.\n\n\"Boy, fill the portable rubber tub in Mr. Forsythe's cabin and bring it\nhere,\" ordered the captain.\n\n\"That will do.\" said Darrow, recovering himself.\n\nHe floated the model in the tub.\n\n\"Now, I don't know how this will come out,\" he said. \"Nor do I know why\nthe _Laughing Lass_ met her fate under Ives and McGuire, and not before.\nPerhaps the chest lay open longer ... long enough, anyway. We'll try it.\"\n\nFrom his pocket he took a curious small phial.\n\n\"Is that what Dr. Schermerhorn gave you?\" asked Slade.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Darrow. He set it carefully inside the little model and\nslipped a lever. Slade quietly turned down the light.\n\nA faint glow shot up. It grew bright and eddied in lovely, variant\ncolours. As if set to a powder train, it ran through the ship. The pale\nfaces of the spectators shone ghastly in its radiance. From someone burst\na sudden gasp.\n\n\"There is not enough for danger,\" said Darrow, quietly.\n\n\"As a point of interest,\" grunted Trendon.\n\nEveryone looked at his outstretched hand. A little pocket compass lay in\nthe palm. The needle spun madly, projecting blue, vivid sparklings.\n\n\"My God!\" cried Slade, and covered his eyes for a moment.\n\nHe snatched away his hands as a suppressed cry went up from the others.\n\n\"As I expected,\" said Darrow quietly.\n\nThe little craft opened out; it disintegrated. All that radiance dissolved\nand with its going the substance upon which it shaped itself vanished. The\nlast glow showed a formless pulp, spreading upon the water.\n\n\"So passed the _Laughing Lass_,\" said Darrow solemnly.\n\n\"And the chest is at the bottom of the sea,\" said Barnett.\n\n\"Good place for it,\" muttered Trendon.\n\n\"In all probability it closed as the ship dissolved around it,\" said\nDarrow. \"Otherwise we should see the effects in the water.\"\n\n\"It might be recovered,\" cried Slade, excitedly.\n\n\"Could you chart it, Darrow? Think of the possibilities--\"\n\n\"Let it lie,\" said the captain. \"Has it not cost enough? Let it lie.\"\n\nThe water in the tub fumed and sparkled faintly and was still. Darkness\nfell, except where Darrow's cigarette point glowed and faded.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Mystery\nby Stewart Edward White and Samuel Hopkins Adams\n\n*** "}, {"short_book_title": "365 Foreign Dishes by Unknown Author", "publication_date": 1908, "url": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10011", "text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Andrew Heath, Joshua Hutchinson, Audrey Longhurst\nand PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\n\n\n\n365 FOREIGN DISHES\n\n\nA Foreign Dish for every day in the year\n\n\n1908\n\n\n\n\n_JANUARY._\n\n\n1.--Austrian Goulasch.\n\nBoil 2 calves' heads in salted water until tender; then cut the meat\nfrom the bone.
