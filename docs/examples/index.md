# Examples

We list here a view small examples, that are easy to run locally on a CPU, 
to show how to use the `posteriors`.

- [Visualizing VI and SGHMC](visualizing_vi_sghmc.md)
- [EKF for Premier League football](ekf_premier_league.md)


Additionally, we provide more in depth examples in the [examples directory on GitHub](https://github.com/normal-computing/posteriors/tree/main/examples), some of which use larger models that 
require a GPU to run.

**TODO**: list examples on GitHub (after consolidating examples folder)
