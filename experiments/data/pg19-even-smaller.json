PAUL\n\nA Collection of Articles Written for and Published in the Daily\nPioneer Press.\n\nBy FRANK MOORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWSPAPER STRUGGLES OF PIONEER DAYS.\n\nA BRIEF NARRATION OF INCIDENTS AND EVENTS CONNECTED WITH THE EARLY\nDAYS OF ST. PAUL, DAILY NEWSPAPERS.\n\n\nIf James M. Goodhue could revisit the earth and make a tour among the\ndaily newspaper offices of St. Paul he would discover that wonderful\nstrides had been made in the method of producing a newspaper during\nthe latter half of the past century. Among the first things to attract\nthe attention of this old-timer would be the web-perfecting press,\ncapable of producing 25,000 impressions an hour, instead of the old\nhand press of 240 impressions an hour; the linotype machine, capable\nof setting 6,000 to 10,000 ems per hour, instead of the old hand\ncompositor producing only 800 to 1,000 ems per hour, and the mailing\nmachine, enabling one man to do the work of five or six under the\nold method. Think of getting out the Sunday Pioneer Press with the\nmaterial in use fifty years ago. It would take 600 hand presses, 600\nhand pressmen and 600 boys three hours to print the edition, and as\nthere were no means of stereotyping in those days the forms would have\nto be set up 600 times, requiring the services of 5,000 compositors.\nPapers printed under these conditions would have to be sold for one\ndollar each, and there would not be much profit in it at that. The\nfirst daily papers printed in St. Paul were not conducted or a very\ngigantic scale, as the entire force of one office generally consisted\nof one pressman, five or six compositors, two editors and a business\nmanager. A few reminiscences of the trials and tribulations of the\nearly newspaper manager, editor and compositor may not be wholly\ndevoid of interest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn 1857 there occurred in Minnesota an election of delegates to the\nconstitutional convention to provide for the admission of Minnesota\ninto the galaxy of states. The election was so close, politically,\nthat when the delegates met there was a division, and the Republicans\nand Democrats held separate conventions. At the conclusion of the work\nof the two conventions the contract for printing was awarded to the\ntwo leading papers of the state--the Pioneer and the Minnesotian--the\nPioneer to print the proceedings of the Democratic body and the\nMinnesotian that of the Republican. This contract called for the\nexpenditure of considerable money for material with which to perform\nthe work. Mr. Moore, the business manager of the Minnesotian, went to\nNew York and purchased a Hoe press, the first one ever brought to the\nstate, and a large quantity of type; also a Hoe proof press, which is\nstill in use in the Pioneer Press composing room. When the book was\nabout completed the business manager of the Minnesotian was informed\nthat an injunction had been issued prohibiting him from drawing\nany money from the state until the question of the right of the\nMinnesotian to do any state printing had been determined by the\ndistrict court. Mr. Goodrich was state printer and claimed he had a\nright to print the proceedings of both constitutional bodies. This\naction on the part of the Pioneer produced great consternation in the\nMinnesotian office, as most of the men had not received more than half\npay for some time, and now, when the balance of their pay was almost\nin sight, they were suddenly compelled to await the slow and doubtful\naction of the courts before receiving pay for their summer's work. The\ndistrict court, subsequently confirmed by the supreme court, decided\nin favor of the Minnesotian, and the day following the decision Mr.\nMoore, of the Minnesotian, brought down a bag of gold from the capitol\ncontaining $4,000, and divided it up among his employes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn 1858, when the first Atlantic cable was laid, the news was\nanxiously looked for, and nearly every inhabitant of the city turned\nout to greet the arrival of the Gray Eagle and Itasca, two of the\nfastest boats on the river, which were expected to bring the news\nof the successful laying of the cable. The Gray Eagle started from\nDubuque at 9 o'clock in the morning and the Itasca started from\nPrairie du Chien, about 100 miles farther up the river, at noon of the\nsame day. When the boats reached the bend below the river they were\nabreast of each other, and as they reached the levee it was hardly\npossible to tell which was ahead. One of the passengers on the Gray\nEagle had a copy of the Dubuque Herald containing the Queen's message,\ntied up with a small stone on the inside of it, and as he threw it to\nthe shore a messenger from the Minnesotian caught it and ran up Bench\nstreet to the Minnesotian office, where the printers were waiting,\nand the Minnesotian had the satisfaction of getting out an extra some\nlittle time before their competitors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the summer season the newspapers had to rely, to a considerable\nextent, on the steamboats for late Dubuque and Chicago papers for\ntelegraph news. There were three or four daily lines of steamers to\nSt. Paul, and every one of them could be distinguished by its whistle.\nWhen it was time for the arrival of the boat bringing the newspapers\nfrom which the different papers expected to get their telegraphic\nnews, messengers from the different offices would be at the levee, and\nas the boat neared the shore they would leap for the gangplank, and\nthere was always a scramble to get to the clerk's office first.\nJames J. Hill and the late Gus Borup were almost always at the levee\nawaiting the arrival of the steamers, but as they were after copies\nof the boats' manifest they did not come in competition with the\nadventurous kids from the newspaper offices.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Minnesotian was probably the first daily paper in the West to\nillustrate a local feature. During the summer of 1859 a man by the\nname of Jackson was lynched by a mob in Wright county, and Gov. Sibley\ncalled out the Pioneer Guards to proceed to the place where the\nlynching occurred and arrest all persons connected with the tragedy.\nThe Pioneer Guards was the crack military company of the state, and\nthe only service any of its members ever expected to do was in the\nballroom or to participate in a Fourth of July parade. When they were\ncalled out by the governor there was great consternation in the ranks.\nOne of the members, who is still a prominent politician in the city,\nwhen told that his first duty was to serve his country, tremblingly\nremarked that he thought his first duty was to provide for his wife\nand family.\n\nA number of them made their wills before departing, as they thought\nthe whole of Wright county was in open rebellion. After being absent\nfor about a week they proudly marched back to the city without ever\nfiring a gun or seeing an enemy. The late J. Fletcher Williams was\ncity editor of the Minnesotian, and he wrote an extended account of\nthe expedition, and It was profusely illustrated with patent medicine\ncuts and inverted wood type and border, the only available material at\nthat time that could be procured.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe year 1859 was a memorable one in the political history of\nMinnesota. Alexander Ramsey and George L. Becker, both now living in\nthis city, were the rival candidates for governor. The Republicans\nmade extraordinary efforts to elect their state and legislative\ntickets, as both governor and United States senator were at stake.\nAmong the speakers imported by the Republicans were the Hon. Galusha\nA. Grow of Pennsylvania and Hon. Schuyler Colfax of Indiana. Mr. Grow,\nthen as now, represented the congressional district in Pennsylvania in\nwhich I formally resided, and I was very anxious to hear him, as the\nfirst political speech I had ever heard was made by him in a small\nvillage in Pennsylvania. The speakers were announced to speak at the\nold People's theater, on the corner of Fourth and St. Peter streets,\nand I was among the first to enter. The theater was packed to\noverflowing. Mr. Grow had made a very interesting speech of about an\nhour's duration, and Mr. Colfax was to follow for an equal length of\ntime. After Mr. Colfax had spoken about ten minutes an alarm of fire\nwas sounded and in less than fifteen minutes the entire structure was\nburned to the ground. This happened about 9:30 o'clock in the\nevening, and, strange to relate, not one of the morning papers had an\nannouncement of the fact the next day. The morning papers at that time\nwere something like an evening paper of to-day. They were set up and\nmade up in the afternoon and generally printed in the early part of\nthe evening. The result of that election was very gratifying to the\nRepublicans. I can see old Dr. Foster now writing a double column\npolitical head for the Minnesotian, the first two lines of which were:\n\"Shout, Republicans, Shout! We've Cleaned the Breech Clouts Out!\"\n\nDr. Foster was the editor of the Minnesotian and was quite a power in\nthe Republican party. He wielded a vigorous pen and possessed a very\nirascible temper. I have often seen him perform some Horace Greeley\nantics in the composing room of the old Minnesotian. At the time of\nthe execution of John Brown for his attempted raid into Virginia, I\nremember bringing the Chicago Tribune to the doctor, containing the\nannouncement of the execution. I had arranged the paper so that the\ndoctor could take in the contents of the heading at the first glance.\nThe doctor looked at the headlines a second and then exclaimed, loud\nenough to be heard a block, \"Great God! In the nineteenth century, a\nman hung for an idea!\"\n\nAt another time the doctor became very much enraged over some news\nthat I had laid before him. In the early 50's Galusha A. Grow, of\nPennsylvania, introduced into the house of representatives the first\nhomestead law and the Republican party soon afterward incorporated\nthe idea into their platform as one of their pet measures. After\nsuperhuman effort the bill passed the house of representatives, that\nbody being nearly tie politically, and was sent to the senate. The\nDemocratic majority in the senate was not very favorably impressed\nwith the measure, but with the assistance of the late President\nJohnson, who was senator from Tennessee at that time, the bill passed\nthe senate by a small majority. There was great rejoicing over the\nevent and no one supposed for a moment that the president would veto\nthe measure. When I laid the Chicago Tribune before the excitable\ndoctor containing the announcement of Buchanan's veto the very air was\nblue with oaths. The doctor took the paper and rushed out into the\nstreet waving the paper frantically in the air, cursing the president\nat every step.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom 1854, the date of the starting of the three St. Paul daily\npapers, until 1860, the time of the completion of the Winslow\ntelegraph line, there was great strife between the Pioneer,\nMinnesotian and Times as to which would be the first to appear on the\nstreet with the full text of the president's message. The messages of\nPierce and Buchanan were very lengthy, and for several days preceding\ntheir arrival the various offices had all the type of every\ndescription distributed and all the printers who could possibly be\nprocured engaged to help out on the extra containing the forthcoming\nmessage. It was customary to pay every one employed, from the devil to\nthe foreman, $2.50 in gold, and every printer in the city was notified\nto be in readiness for the approaching typographical struggle. One\nyear one of the proprietors of the Minnesotian thought he would\nsurprise the other offices, and he procured the fastest livery team In\nthe city and went down the river as far as Red Wing to intercept the\nmail coach, and expected to return to St. Paul three or four hours in\nadvance of the regular mail, which would give him that much advantage\nover his competitors. Owing to some miscalculation as to the time the\nstage left Chicago the message was delivered in St. Paul twenty-four\nhours earlier than was expected, and the proprietor of the Minnesotian\nhad the pleasure of receiving a copy of his own paper, containing the\ncomplete message, long before he returned to St. Paul. The management\nalways provided an oyster supper for the employes of the paper first\nout with the message, and it generally required a week for the typos\nto fully recover from its effect.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs an evidence of what was uppermost in the minds of most people at\nthis time, and is probably still true to-day, it may be related that\nin the spring of 1860, when the great prize fight between Heenan and\nSayers was to occur in England, and the meeting of the Democratic\nnational convention in Charleston, in which the Minnesota Democrats\nwere in hopes that their idol, Stephen A. Douglas, would be nominated\nfor president, the first question asked by the people I would meet on\nthe way from the boat landing to the office would be: \"Anything from\nthe prize fight? What is the news from the Charleston convention?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The good old times\" printers often talk about were evidently not the\nyears between the great panic of 1857 and the breaking out of the\nCivil war in 1861. Wages were low and there was absolutely no money to\nspeak of. When a man did occasionally get a dollar he was not sure it\nwould be worth its face value when the next boat would arrive with\na new Bank Note Reporter. Married men considered themselves very\nfortunate when they could get, on Saturday night, an order on a\ngrocery or dry goods store for four or five dollars, and the single\nmen seldom received more than $2 or $3 cash. That was not more than\nhalf enough to pay their board bill. This state of affairs continued\nuntil the Press was started in 1861, when Gov. Marshall inaugurated\nthe custom, which still prevails, of paying his employes every\nSaturday night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother instance of the lack of enterprise on the part of the daily\npaper of that day:\n\nDuring the summer of 1860 a large party of Republican statesmen and\npoliticians visited St. Paul, consisting of State Senator W.H. Seward.\nSenator John P. Hale, Charles Francis Adams, Senator Nye, Gen. Stewart\nL. Woodford and several others of lesser celebrity. The party came to\nMinnesota in the interest of the Republican candidate for president.\nMr. Seward made a great speech from the front steps of the old\ncapitol, in which he predicted that at some distant day the capitol\nof this great republic would be located not far from the Falls of St.\nAnthony. There was a large gathering at the capitol to hear him, but\nthose who were not fortunate enough to get within sound of his voice\nhad to wait until the New York Herald, containing a full report of\nhis speech, reached St. Paul before they could read what the great\nstatesman had said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the fall of 1860 the first telegraph line was completed to St.\nPaul. Newspaper proprietors thought they were then in the world, so\nfar as news is concerned, but it was not to be so. The charges for\ntelegraph news were so excessive that the three papers in St. Paul\ncould not afford the luxury of the \"latest news by Associated Press.\"\nThe offices combined against the extortionate rates demanded by the\ntelegraph company and made an agreement not to take the dispatches\nuntil the rates were lowered; but it was like an agreement of the\nrailroad presidents of the present day, it was not adhered to. The\nPioneer made a secret contract with the telegraph company and left the\nMinnesotian and the Times out in the cold. Of course that was a very\nunpleasant state of affairs and for some time the Minnesotian and\nTimes would wait until the Pioneer was out in the morning and would\nthen set up the telegraph and circulate their papers. One of the\neditors connected with the Minnesotian had an old acquaintance in the\npressroom of the Pioneer, and through him secured one of the first\npapers printed. This had been going on for some time when Earle S.\nGoodrich, the editor of the Pioneer, heard of it, and he accordingly\nmade preparation to perpetrate a huge joke on the Minnesotian. Mr.\nGoodrich was a very versatile writer and he prepared four or five\ncolumns of bogus telegraph and had it set up and two or three copies\nof the Pioneer printed for the especial use of the Minnesotian. The\nscheme worked to a charm. Amongst the bogus news was a two-column\nspeech purporting to have been made by William H. Seward in the senate\njust previous to the breaking out of the war. Mr. Seward's well-known\nideas were so closely imitated that their genuineness were not\nquestioned. The rest of the news was made up of dispatches purporting\nto be from the then excited Southern States. The Minnesotian received\na Pioneer about 4 o'clock in the morning and by 8 the entire edition\nwas distributed throughout the city. I had distributed the Minnesotian\nthroughout the upper portion of the city, and just as I returned to\nBridge Square I met the carrier of the Pioneer, and laughed at him for\nbeing so late. He smiled, but did not speak. As soon as I learned what\nhad happened I did not do either. The best of the joke was, the Times\ncould not obtain an early copy of the Pioneer and set up the bogus\nnews from the Minnesotian, and had their edition printed and ready to\ncirculate when they heard of the sell. They at once set up the genuine\nnews and circulated both the bogus and regular, and made fun of the\nMinnesotian for being so easily taken in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Pioneer retained the monopoly of the news until the Press was\nstarted, on the 1st of January, 1861. The Press made arrangements with\nMr. Winslow for full telegraphic dispatches, but there was another\nhitch in the spring of 1861 and for some time the Press had to obtain\nits telegraph from proof sheets of the St. Anthony Falls News, a paper\npublished in what is now East Minneapolis. Gov. Marshall was very much\nexercised at being compelled to go to a neighboring town for telegraph\nnews, and one night when news of unusual importance was expected he\nhad a very stormy interview with Mr. Winslow. No one ever knew exactly\nwhat he told him, but that night the Press had full telegraphic\nreports, and has had ever since.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGov. Marshall was a noble man. When the first battle of Bull Run\noccurred the earlier reports announced a great Union victory. I\nremember of going to Dan Rice's circus that night and felt as chipper\nas a young kitten. After the circus was out I went back to the office\nto see if any late news had been received. I met Gov. Marshall at the\ndoor, and with tears rolling down his cheeks he informed me that the\nUnion force had met with a great reverse and he was afraid the\ncountry would never recover from it. But it did, and the governor\nwas afterward one of the bravest of the brave in battling for his\ncountry's honor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrinters were very patriotic, and when Father Abraham called for\n\"three hundred thousand more\" in July, 1862, so many enlisted that\nit was with much difficulty that the paper was enabled to present a\nrespectable appearance. The Press advertised for anything that could\nset type to come in and help it out. I remember one man applying\nwho said he never had set any type, but he had a good theoretical\nknowledge of the business.\n\nOne evening an old gentleman by the name of Metcalf, father of the\nlate T.M. Metcalf, came wandering into the office about 9 o'clock and\ntold the foreman he thought he could help him out. He was given a\npiece of copy and worked faithfully until the paper went to press.\nHe was over eighty years old and managed to set about 1,000 ems. Mr.\nMetcalf got alarmed at his father's absence from home and searched the\ncity over, and finally found him in the composing room of the Press.\nThe old man would not go home with his son, but insisted on remaining\nuntil the paper was up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlthough Minnesota sent to the war as many, if not more, men than any\nother state in the Union in proportion to its population, yet it was\nnecessary to resort to a draft in a few counties where the population\nwas largely foreign. The feeling against the draft was very bitter,\nand the inhabitants of the counties which were behind in the quota did\nnot take kindly to the idea of being drafted to fight for a cause they\ndid not espouse. A riot was feared, and troops were ordered down from\nthe fort to be in readiness for any disturbance that might occur.\nArrangements for the prosecution of the draft were made as rapidly as\npossible, but the provost marshal was not in readiness to have it take\nplace on the day designated by the war department. This situation\nof affairs was telegraphed to the president and the following\ncharacteristic reply was received: \"If the draft cannot take place, of\ncourse it cannot take place. Necessity knows no law. A. Lincoln.\" The\nbitterest feeling of the anti-drafters seemed to be against the\nold St. Paul Press, a paper that earnestly advocated the vigorous\nprosecution of the war. Threats were made to mob the office. A company\nwas organized for self-defense, and Capt. E.R. Otis, now of West\nSuperior, one of the Press compositors at that time, was made post\ncommander. Capt. Otis had seen service in the early part of the war\nand the employes considered themselves fortunate in having a genuine\nmilitary man for a leader. The office was barricaded, fifteen old\nSpringfield muskets and 800 rounds of ammunition was brought down from\nthe capitol and every one instructed what to do in case of an attack.\nI slept on a lounge in the top story of the old Press building\noverlooking Bridge Square, and the guns and ammunition were under my\nbed. I was supposed to give the alarm should the mob arrive after the\nemployes had gone home. As there was no possible avenue of escape in\ncase of an attack, it looks now as if the post commander displayed\npoor judgment in placing a lone sentinel on guard. But there was no\nriot. The excitement gradually died away and the draft took place\nwithout interruption.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore and some time after the war the daily newspapers took advantage\nof all the holidays and seldom issued papers on the days following\nChristmas, New Year's, Washington's birthday, Fourth of July\nand Thanksgiving. On the Fourth of July, 1863, the Pioneer made\narrangements to move from their old quarters near the corner of Third\nand Cedar streets to the corner of Third and Robert. It happened\nthat on that day two of the greatest events of the Civil war had\noccurred--the battle of Gettysburg and the surrender of Vicksburg. The\nPioneer being engaged in moving their plant could not issue an extra\non that occasion, and the Press had the field exclusively to itself.\nThe news of these two great events had become pretty generally known\nthroughout the city and the anxiety to get fuller particulars was\nsimply intense. The Press, having a clear field for that day, did not\npropose to issue its extra until the fullest possible details had\nbeen received. A great crowd had assembled in front of the old Press\noffice, anxiously awaiting details of the great Union victories. I had\nhelped prepare the news for the press and followed the forms to the\npress room. As soon as a sufficient number of papers had been printed\nI attempted to carry them to the counting room and place them on sale.\nAs I opened the side door of the press room and undertook to reach the\ncounting room by a short circuit, I found the crowd on the outside had\nbecome so large that it was impossible to gain an entrance in that\ndirection, and undertook to retreat and try another route. But quicker\nthan a flash I was raised to the shoulders of the awaiting crowd and\nwalked on their heads to the counting room window, where I sold what\nfew papers I had as rapidly as I could hand them out. As soon as the\nmagnitude of the news got circulated cheer after cheer rent the air,\nand cannon, anvils, firecrackers and everything that would make a\nnoise was brought into requisition, and before sundown St. Paul had\ncelebrated the greatest Fourth of July in its history.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI arrived in St. Paul on the morning of the 17th of April, 1858, and\nImmediately commenced work on the Daily Minnesotian, my brother, Geo.\nW. Moore, being part owner and manager of the paper. I had not been at\nwork long before I learned what a \"scoop\" was. Congress had passed\na bill admitting Minnesota into the Union, but as there was no\ntelegraphic communication with Washington it required two or three\ndays for the news to reach the state. The Pioneer, Minnesotian and\nTimes were morning papers, and were generally printed the evening\nbefore. It so happened that the news of the admission of Minnesota was\nbrought to St. Paul by a passenger on a late boat and the editors of\nthe Pioneer accidentally heard of the event and published the same\non the following morning, thus scooping the other two papers. The\nMinnesotian got out an extra and sent it around to their subscribers\nand they thought they had executed a great stroke of enterprise. It\nwas not long before I became familiar with the method of obtaining\nnews and I was at the levee on the arrival of every boat thereafter.\nI could tell every boat by its whistle, and there was no more scoops\n'till the telegraph line was completed in the summer of 1860.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the latter part of the Civil war the daily newspapers began to\nexpand, and have ever since kept fully abreast of the requirements of\nour rapidly increasing population. The various papers were printed on\nsingle-cylinder presses until about 1872, when double-cylinders were\nintroduced. In 1876 the first turtle-back press was brought to the\ncity, printing four pages at one time. In 1880 the different offices\nintroduced stereotyping, and in 1892 linotype type-setting machines\nwere installed. The next great advance will probably be some system of\nphotography that will entirely dispense with the work of the printer\nand proofreader. Who knows?\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIVE MILLION LOAN ELECTION.\n\nEARLY STEAMBOATING--CELEBRATION OF THE SUCCESSFUL LAYING OF THE FIRST\nATLANTIC CABLE--A FIGHT BETWEEN THE CHIPPEWAS AND SIOUXS.\n\n\n\"Right this way for the Fuller house!\" \"Right this way for the Winslow\nhouse!\" \"Right this way for the American house!\" \"Merchants hotel\non the levee!\" \"Stage for St. Anthony Falls!\" These were the\nannouncements that would greet the arrival of travelers as they would\nalight from one of the splendid steamers of the Galena, Dunleith,\nDubuque and Minnesota Packet company during the days when traveling\nby steamboat was the only way of reaching points on the upper\nMississippi. Besides the above hotels, there was the Central house,\nthe Temperance house, the City hotel, Minnesota house, the Western\nhouse, the Hotel to the Wild Hunter, whose curious sign for many years\nattracted the attention of the visitor, and many others. The Merchants\nis the only one left, and that only in name. Messengers from newspaper\noffices, representatives of storage and commission houses, merchants\nlooking for consignments of goods, residents looking for friends, and\nthe ever alert dealers in town lots on the scent of fresh victims,\nwere among the crowds that daily congregated at the levee whenever the\narrival of one of the packet company's regular steamers was expected.\nAt one time there was a daily line of steamers to La Crosse, a daily\nline to Prairie du Chien, a daily line to Dubuque and a line to St.\nLouis, and three daily lines for points on the Minnesota river.\nDoes any one remember the deep bass whistle of the Gray Eagle, the\ncombination whistle on the Key City, the ear-piercing shriek of the\nlittle Antelope, and the discordant notes of the calliope on the\nDenmark? The officers of these packets were the king's of the day, and\nwhen any one of them strayed up town he attracted as much attention as\na major general of the regulars. It was no uncommon sight to see six\nor eight steamers at the levee at one time, and their appearance\npresented a decided contrast to the levee of the present time. The\nfirst boat through the lake in the spring was granted free wharfage,\nand as that meant about a thousand dollars, there was always an\neffort made to force a passage through the lake as soon as possible.\nTraveling by steamboat during the summer months was very pleasant,\nbut it was like taking a trip to the Klondike to go East during the\nwinter. Merchants were compelled to supply themselves with enough\ngoods to last from November till April, as it was too expensive\nto ship goods by express during the winter. Occasionally some\nenterprising merchant would startle the community by announcing\nthrough the newspapers that he had just received by Burbank's express\na new pattern in dress goods, or a few cans of fresh oysters. The\nstages on most of the routes left St. Paul at 4 o'clock in the\nmorning, and subscribers to daily newspapers within a radius of forty\nmiles of the city could read the news as early as they can during\nthese wonderful days of steam and electricity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProbably no election ever occurred in Minnesota that excited so much\ninterest as the one known as the \"Five Million Loan Election.\" It was\nnot a party measure, as the leading men of both parties favored it;\nalthough the Republicans endeavored to make a little capital out of it\nat a later period. The only paper of any prominence that opposed the\npassage of the amendment was the Minnesotian, edited by Dr. Thomas\nFoster. That paper was very violent in its abuse of every one who\nfavored the passage of the law, and its opposition probably had an\nopposite effect from what was intended by the redoubtable doctor. The\ngreat panic of 1857 had had a very depressing effect on business\nof every description and it was contended that the passage of this\nmeasure would give employment to thousands of people; that the\nrumbling of the locomotive would soon be heard in every corner of the\nstate, and that the dealer in town lots and broad acres would again be\nable to complacently inform the newcomer the exact locality where a\nfew dollars would soon bring to the investor returns unheard of by\nany ordinary methods of speculation. The campaign was short and the\namendment carried by an immense majority. So nearly unanimous was\nthe sentiment of the community in favor of the measure that it was\nextremely hazardous for any one to express sentiments In opposition to\nit. The city of St. Paul, with a population of about 10,000, gave a\nmajority of over 4,000 for the law. There was no Australian law\nat that time, and one could vote early and often without fear of\nmolestation. One of the amusing features of the campaign, and in\nopposition to the measure, was a cartoon drawn by R.O. Sweeney, now\na resident of Duluth. It was lithographed and widely circulated. The\nnewspapers had no facilities for printing cartoons at that time. They\nhad to be printed on a hand press and folded into the papers. It was\nproposed, by the terms of this amendment to the constitution, to\ndonate to four different railroad companies $10,000 per mile for every\nmile of road graded and ready to iron. Work Was commenced soon after\nthe passage of the law, and in a short time a demand was made by the\nrailroad companies upon Gov. Sibley for the issuance of the bonds, in\naccordance with their idea of the terms of the contract made by the\nstate. Gov. Sibley declined to issue the bonds until the rights of\nthe state had been fully protected. The railroad companies would not\naccept the restrictions placed upon them by the governor, and they\nobtained a peremptory writ from the supreme court directing that they\nbe issued. The governor held that the supreme court had no authority\nto coerce the executive branch of the state government, but on the\nadvice of the attorney general, and rather than have any friction\nbetween the two branches of the government, he, in accordance with the\nmandate of the court, reluctantly signed the bonds. Judge Flandrau\ndissented from the opinion of his colleagues, and had his ideas\nprevailed the state's financial reputation would have been vastly\nimproved. Dr. Foster did not believe Gov. Sibley was sincere in his\nefforts to protect the interests of the state, and denounced him with\nthe same persistence he had during the campaign of the previous fall.\nThe doctor would never acknowledge that Gov. Sibley was the legal\ngovernor of Minnesota, and Tie contended that he had no right to sign\nthe bonds: that their issuance was illegal, and that neither the\nprincipal nor the interest would ever be paid. The Minnesotian carried\nat the head of its columns the words \"Official Paper of the City,\" and\nit was feared that its malignant attacks upon the state officials,\ndenouncing the issuance of the bonds as fraudulent and illegal, would\nbe construed abroad as reflecting the sentiment of the majority of the\npeople in the the community in which it was printed, and would have a\nbad effect in the East when the time came to negotiate the bonds. An\neffort was made to induce the city council to deprive that paper of\nits official patronage, but that body could not see its way clear to\nabrogate its contract. Threats were made to throw the office into the\nriver, but they did not materialize. When Gov. Sibley endeavored\nto place these bonds on the New York market he was confronted\nwith conditions not anticipated, and suffered disappointment and\nhumiliation in consequence of the failure of the attempt. The bonds\ncould not be negotiated. The whole railway construction scheme\nsuddenly collapsed, the railroad companies defaulted, the credit of\nthe state was compromised, \"and enterprise of great pith and\nmoment had turned their currents awry.\" The evil forbodings of the\nMinnesotian became literally true, and for more than twenty years\nthe repudiated bonds of Minnesota were a blot on the pages of her\notherwise spotless record. Nearly 250 miles of road were graded, on\nwhich the state foreclosed and a few years later donated the same to\nnew organizations. During the administration of Gov. Pillsbury the\nstate compromised with the holders of these securities and paid 50 per\ncent of their nominal value. Will she ever pay the rest?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the latter part of May, 1858, a battle was fought near Shakopee\nbetween the Sioux and the Chippewas. A party of Chippewa warriors,\nunder the command of the famous Chief Hole-in-the-day, surprised a\nbody of Sioux on the river bottoms near Shakopee and mercilessly\nopened fire on them, killing and wounding fifteen or twenty. Eight or\nten Chippewas were killed during the engagement. The daily papers\nsent reporters to the scene of the conflict and they remained in that\nvicinity several days on the lookout for further engagements. Among\nthe reporters was John W. Sickels, a fresh young man from one of the\nEastern cities. He was attached to the Times' editorial staff and\nfurnished that paper with a very graphic description of the events of\nthe preceding days, and closed his report by saying that he was unable\nto find out the \"origin of the difficulty.\" As the Sioux and\nChippewas were hereditary enemies, his closing announcement afforded\nconsiderable amusement to the old inhabitants.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe celebration in St. Paul in honor of the successful laying of the\nAtlantic cable, which took place on the first day of September, 1858,\nwas one of the first as well as one of the most elaborate celebrations\nthat ever occurred in the city. The announcement of the completion of\nthe enterprise, which occurred on the 5th of the previous month, did\nnot reach St. Paul until two or three days later, as there was no\ntelegraphic communication to the city at that time. As soon as\nmessages had been exchanged between Queen Victoria and President\nBuchanan it was considered safe to make preparations for a grand\ncelebration. Most of the cities throughout the United States were\nmaking preparations to celebrate on that day, and St. Paul did not\npropose to be outdone. The city council appropriated several hundred\ndollars to assist in the grand jubilation and illumination. An\nelaborate program was prepared and a procession that would do credit\nto the city at the present time marched through the principal streets,\nto the edification of thousands of spectators from the city and\nsurrounding country. To show that a procession in the olden time was\nvery similar to one of the up-to-date affairs, the following order of\nprocession is appended:\n\nTHE PROCESSION.\n\n  Escort of Light Cavalry.\n  Band.\n  Pioneer Guard.\n  City Guard.\n  City Battery.\n  Floral procession with escort of Mounted Cadets,\n    representing Queen Victoria, President Buchanan,\n    the different States of the Union, and\n    other devices.\n  The Governor and State Officers in carriages.\n  The Judges of the State in carriages.\n  The Clergy.\n  Officers of the Army.\n  Officers of the Navy.\n  The Municipal Authorities of Neighboring Cities.\n  The Board of Education in Carriages.\n  The Mayor and City Council.\n  Knights Templars on Horseback.\n  Band.\n  Odd Fellows.\n  Druids.\n  Typographical Corps.\n  Band.\n  Officers and Crews of Vessels in Port.\n  Turners.\n  German Reading Society.\n  German Singing Society.\n  Attaches of Postoffice Department.\n  Citizens in Carriages.\n  Citizens on Horseback.\n  Brewers on Horseback.\n  Butchers on Horseback.\n\nCol. AC Jones, adjutant general of the state, was marshal-in-chief,\nand he was assisted by a large number of aides. The Pioneer Guards,\nthe oldest military company in the state, had the right of line. They\nhad just received their Minie rifles and bayonets, and, with the\ndrum-major headgear worn by military companies in those days,\npresented a very imposing appearance. The Pioneer Guards were followed\nby the City Guards, under Capt. John O'Gorman. A detachment of cavalry\nand the City Battery completed the military part of the affair. The\nfire department, under the superintendence of the late Charles H.\nWilliams, consisting of the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company, Minnehaha\nEngine company, Hope Engine company and the Rotary Mill company was\nthe next in order. One of the most attractive features of the occasion\nwas the contribution of the Pioneer Printing company. In a large car\ndrawn by six black horses an attempt was made to give an idea of\nprinters and printing in the days of Franklin, and also several\nepochs in the life of the great philosopher. In the car with the\nrepresentatives of the art preservative was Miss Azelene Allen, a\nbeautiful and popular young actress connected with the People's\ntheater, bearing in her hand a cap of liberty on a spear. She\nrepresented the Goddess of Liberty. The car was ornamented with\nflowers and the horses were decorated with the inscriptions\n\"Franklin,\" \"Morse,\" \"Field.\" The Pioneer book bindery was also\nrepresented in one of the floats, and workmen, both male and female,\nwere employed in different branches of the business. These beautiful\nfloats were artistically designed by George H. Colgrave, who is\nstill in the service of the Pioneer Press company. One of the unique\nfeatures of the parade, and one that attracted great attention, was a\nlight brigade, consisting of a number of school children mounted, and\nthey acted as a guard of honor to the president and queen. In an open\nbarouche drawn by four horses were seated two juvenile representatives\nof President Buchanan and Queen Victoria. The representative of\nBritish royalty was Miss Rosa Larpenteur, daughter of A.L. Larpenteur,\nand the first child born of white parents in St. Paul. James Buchanan\nwas represented by George Folsom, also a product of the city. Col.\nR.E.J. Miles and Miss Emily Dow, the stars at the People's theater,\nwere in the line of march on two handsomely caparisoned horses,\ndressed in Continental costume, representing George and Martha\nWashington. The colonel looked like the veritable Father of His\nCountry. There were a number of other floats, and nearly all the\nsecret societies of the city were in line. The procession was nearly\ntwo miles in length and they marched three and one-half hours before\nreaching their destination. To show the difference between a line of\nmarch at that time and one at the present day, the following is given:\n\nTHE LINE OF MARCH.\n\nUp St. Anthony street to Fort street, up Fort street to Ramsey street,\nthen countermarch down Fort to Fourth street, down Fourth street to\nMinnesota street, up Minnesota street to Seventh street, down Seventh\nstreet to Jackson street, up Jackson street to Eighth street, down\nEighth street to Broadway, down Broadway to Seventh street, up Seventh\nstreet to Jackson street, down Jackson street to Third street, up\nThird street to Market street.\n\nEx-Gov. W.A. Gorman and ex-Gov. Alex. Ramsey were the orators of the\noccasion, and they delivered very lengthy addresses. It had been\narranged to have extensive fireworks in the evening, but on account of\nthe storm they had to be postponed until the following night.\n\nIt was a strange coincidence that on the very day of the celebration\nthe last message was exchanged between England and America. The cable\nhad been in successful operation about four weeks and 129 messages\nwere received from England and 271 sent from America. In 1866 a new\ncompany succeeded in laying the cable which is in successful\noperation to-day. Four attempts were made before the enterprise was\nsuccessful--the first in 1857, the second in 1858, the third in 1863\nand the successful one in 1865. Cyrus W. Field, the projector of the\nenterprise, received the unanimous thanks of congress, and would have\nbeen knighted by Great Britain had Mr. Field thought it proper to\naccept such honor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome time during the early '50s a secret order known as the Sons of\nMalta was organized in one of the Eastern states, and its membership\nincreased throughout the West with as much rapidity as the Vandals and\nGoths increased their numbers during the declining years of the Roman\nEmpire. Two or three members of the Pioneer editorial staff procured a\ncharter from Pittesburg in 1858 and instituted a lodge in St. Paul.\nIt was a grand success from the start. Merchants, lawyers, doctors,\nprinters, and in fact half of the male population, was soon enrolled\nin the membership of the order. There was something so grand, gloomy\nand peculiar about the initiation that made it certain that as soon\nas one victim had run the gauntlet he would not be satisfied until\nanother one had been procured. When a candidate had been proposed for\nmembership the whole lodge acted as a committee of investigation,\nand if it could be ascertained that he had ever been derelict in his\ndealings with his fellow men he was sure to be charged with it when\nbeing examined by the high priest in the secret chamber of the\norder--that is, the candidate supposed he was in a secret chamber from\nthe manner in which he had to be questioned, but when the hood had\nbeen removed from his face he found, much to his mortification, that\nhis confession had been made to the full membership of the order.\nOccasionally the candidate would confess to having been more of a\ntransgresser than his questioners had anticipated.\n\nThe following is a sample of the questions asked a candidate for\nadmission: Grand Commander to candidate, \"Are you in favor of\nthe acquisition of the Island of Cuba?\" Candidate, \"I am.\" Grand\nCommander, \"In case of an invasion of the island, would you lie awake\nnights and steal into the enemy's camp?\" Candidate, \"I would.\" Grand\nCommander, \"Let it be recorded, he will lie and steal,\" and then an\nimmense gong at the far end of the hall would be sounded and the\ncandidate would imagine that the day of judgment had come. The scheme\nof bouncing candidates into the air from a rubber blanket, so popular\nduring the days of the recent ice carnivals was said to have been\noriginal with the Sons of Malta, and was one of the mildest of the\nmany atrocities perpetrated by this most noble order.\n\nSome time during the summer a large excursion party of members of the\norder from Cincinnati, Chicago and Milwaukee visited St. Paul.\nAmong the number was the celebrated elocutionist, Alf. Burnett of\nCincinnati, and Gov. Alexander Randall of Wisconsin. They arrived at\nthe lower levee about midnight and marched up Third street to the hall\nof the order, where a grand banquet was awaiting them. The visitors\nwere arrayed in long, black robes, with a black hood over their heads,\nand looked more like the prisoners in the play of \"Lucretia Borgia\"\nthan members of modern civilization.\n\nOn the following day there was an immense barbecue at Minnehaha\nFalls, when the visitors were feasted with an ox roasted whole. This\norganization kept on increasing in membership, until in an evil hour\none of the members had succeeded in inducing the Rev. John Penman\nto consent to become one of its members. Mr. Penman was so highly\nIndignant at the manner in which he had been handled during the\ninitiation that he immediately wrote an expose of the secret work,\nwith numerous illustrations, and had it published in Harper's Weekly.\nThe exposition acted like a bombshell in the camp of the Philistines,\nand ever after Empire hall, the headquarters of the order, presented\na dark and gloomy appearance. The reverend gentleman was judge of\nprobate of Ramsey county at the time, but his popularity suddenly\ndiminished and when his term of office expired he found it to his\nadvantage to locate in a more congenial atmosphere.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Minnesotian and Times, although both Republican papers, never\ncherished much love for each other. The ravings of the Eatanswill\nGazette were mild in comparison to the epithets used by these little\npapers in describing the shortcomings of their \"vile and reptile\ncontemporary.\" After the election in 1859, as soon as it was known\nthat the Republicans had secured a majority in the legislature, the\nmanagers of these rival Republican offices instituted a very lively\ncampaign for the office of state printer. Both papers had worked hard\nfor the success of the Republican ticket and they had equal claims\non the party for recognition. Both offices were badly in need of\nfinancial assistance, and had the Republican party not been successful\none of them, and perhaps both, would have been compelled to suspend.\nHow to divide the patronage satisfactorily to both papers was the\nproblem that confronted the legislature about to assemble. The war of\nwords between Foster and Newson continued with unabated ferocity. The\neditor of the Minnesotian would refer to the editor of the Times\nas \"Mr. Timothy Muggins Newson\"--his right name being Thomas M.\nNewson--and the Times would frequently mention Dr. Foster as the\n\"red-nosed, goggle-eyed editor of the Minnesotian.\" To effect a\nreconciliation between these two editors required the best diplomatic\ntalent of the party leaders. After frequent consultations between the\nleading men of the party and the managers of the two offices, it was\narranged that the papers should be consolidated and the name of the\npaper should be the Minnesotian and Times. It can readily be seen\nthat a marriage contracted under these peculiar circumstances was\nnot likely to produce a prolonged state of connubial felicity. The\nrelations between Foster and Newson were no more cordial under one\nmanagement than had hitherto existed when the offices were separate.\nThis unhappy situation continued until about the time the legislature\nadjourned, when the partnership was dissolved. Dr. Foster assumed\nentire control of the Minnesotian and Maj. Newson was manager of\nthe Times. George W. Moore was associated with Dr. Foster in the\npublication of the Minnesotian prior to the consolidation, but when\nthe offices separated it was stipulated that Mr. Moore should have the\nprinting of the Journals of the two houses of the legislature as part\npayment of his share of the business of the late firm of Newson,\nMoore, Foster & Co., thus entirely severing his relations with the\npaper he helped to found. After the arrangement was made it was with\nthe greatest difficulty that it was carried into effect, as Orville\nBrown of Faribault had entered the field as a candidate for state\nprinter and came within a few votes of taking the printing to that\nvillage. The Times continued under the management of Mr. Newson until\nthe first of January, 1861, when he leased the office to W.R. Marshall\nand Thomas F. Slaughter, who started the St. Paul Daily Press with\nits material. The Press proved to be too much of a competitor for the\nMinnesotian, and in a short time Dr. Foster was compelled to surrender\nto its enterprising projectors, they having purchased the entire\nplant. This ended the rivalry between the two Republican dailies. Dr.\nFoster and Maj. Newson, some time afterward, received commissions in\nthe volunteer service of the army during the Civil war, and George W.\nMoore was appointed collector of the port of St. Paul, a position he\nheld for more than twenty years.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDoes any one remember that St. Paul had a paper called the Daily North\nStar? The historians of St. Paul and Ramsey county do not seem to ever\nhave chronicled the existence of this sprightly little sheet. During\nthe presidential campaign of 1860 we had two kinds of Democrats--the\nDouglas and the Breckinridge or administration Democrats. There\nwere only two papers in the state that espoused the cause of\nMr. Breckinridge--the Chatfield Democrat and the Henderson\nIndependent--and as they had been designated by the president to\npublish such portion of the acts of congress as it was customary\nto print at that time, it was quite natural that they carried the\nadministration colors at the head of their columns. They were called\n\"bread and butter papers.\" The supporters of Mr. Breckinridge thought\ntheir cause would present a more respectable appearance if they had an\norgan at the capital of the state. Accordingly the late H.H. Young,\nthe editor of the Henderson Independent, was brought down from that\nvillage and the Daily North Star soon made its appearance. It was not\nnecessary at that time to procure the Associated Press dispatches, a\nperfecting press and linotype machines before embarking in a daily\nnewspaper enterprise, as a Washington hand press and five or six\ncases of type were all that were necessary. This paper was published\nregularly until after election, and as the returns indicated that the\nofficeholders would not much longer contribute toward its support it\nsoon collapsed.\n\nSt. Paul had another paper that is very seldom mentioned in newspaper\nhistory. It was called the St. Paul Weekly Journal, and was edited by\nDr. Massey, formerly of the Ohio Statesman and private secretary to\nGov. Sam Medary. This paper was started in 1862, but on account of its\nviolent opposition to the prosecution of the war did not meet with\nmuch favor, and only existed about eight months.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome time during the year 1858 the Minnesotian office received about\nhalf a dozen cases of very bad whisky in payment of a very bad debt.\nThey could not sell it--they could not even give it to any one.\nOccasionally the thirst of an old-time compositor would get the\nbetter of him and he would uncork a bottle. The experiment was never\nrepeated. Think of half a dozen cases of whisky remaining unmolested\nin a printing office for more than two years. During the campaign\nof 1860 the Wide Awakes and the Little Giants were the uniformed\npolitical organizations intended to attract the attention of voters.\nOne dreary night one of the attaches of the Minnesotian office, and an\nactive member of the Wide Awakes, met the Little Giants near Bridge\nSquare as they were returning to their hall after a long march.\nIn order to establish a sort of entente cordiale between the two\norganisations the Little Giants were invited over to the Minnesotian\noffice in hopes they would be able to reduce the supply of this\nnauseating beverage. It was a golden opportunity. The invitation was\nreadily accepted, and in a short time fifty ardent followers of the\nadvocate of squatter sovereignty were lined up in front of a black\nRepublican office, thirsting for black Republican whisky. Bottle after\nbottle, was passed down the line, and as it gurgled down the throats\nof these enthusiastic marchers they smacked their lips with as much\ngusto as did Rip Van Winkle when partaking of the soporific potation\nthat produced his twenty years' sleep. One of the cardinal principles\nof the Democracy, at that time was to \"love rum and hate <DW65>s.\" As\nthe entire stock was disposed of before the club resumed its line of\nmarch, the host of the occasion concluded that at least one plank of\ntheir platform was rigidly adhered to.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862.\n\nNARRATION OF SOME OF THE EXCITING EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE\nGREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862--FORT RIDGELY, NEW ULM AND BIRCH\nCOULIE--OTHER DAY AND WABASHA--GREAT EXCITEMENT IN ST. PAUL.\n\n\nIn July and August, 1862, President Lincoln issued proclamations\ncalling for the enlistment of 600,000 volunteers for the purpose of\nreinforcing the army, then vainly endeavoring to suppress the Southern\nrebellion. It was probably one of the most gloomy periods in the\nhistory of the Civil war. McClellan had been compelled to make a\nprecipitous and disastrous retreat from the vicinity of Richmond;\nthe army of Northern Virginia under Pope had met with several severe\nreverses; the armies in the West under Grant, Buell and Curtis had not\nbeen able to make any progress toward the heart of the Confederacy;\nrebel marauders under Morgan were spreading desolation and ruin in\nKentucky and Ohio; rebel privateers were daily eluding the vigilant\nwatch of the navy and escaping to Europe with loads of cotton, which\nthey readily disposed of and returned with arms and ammunition to aid\nin the prosecution of their cause. France was preparing to invade\nMexico with a large army for the purpose of forcing the establishment\nof a monarchical form of government upon the people of our sister\nrepublic; the sympathies of all the great powers of Europe, save\nRussia, were plainly manifested by outspoken utterances favorable to\nthe success of the Confederate cause; rumors of foreign intervention\nin behalf of the South were daily circulated; the enemies of the\ngovernment in the North were especially active in their efforts\nto prevent the enlistment of men under the call of the president;\nconspiracies for burning Northern cities had been unearthed by\ngovernment detectives, and emissaries from the South were endeavoring\nto spread disease and pestilence throughout the loyal North. It was\nduring this critical period in the great struggle for the suppression\nof the Rebellion that one of the most fiendish atrocities in the\nhistory of Indian warfare was enacted on the western boundaries of\nMinnesota.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt can readily be seen that the government was illy prepared to cope\nwith an outbreak of such magnitude as this soon proved to be. By the\nterms of the treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 the\nSioux sold all their lands in Minnesota, except a strip ten miles wide\non each side of the Minnesota river from near Fort Ridgely to Big\nStone lake. In 1858 ten miles of the strip lying north of the river\nwas sold, mainly through the influence of Little Crow. The selling of\nthis strip caused great dissatisfaction among the Indians and Little\nCrow was severely denounced for the part he took in the transaction.\nThe sale rendered it necessary for all the Indians to locate on the\nsouth side of the Minnesota, where game was scarce and trapping poor.\nThere was nothing for them to live upon unless they adopted the habits\nof civilization and worked like white men. This was very distasteful\nto many of them, as they wanted to live the same as they did before\nthe treaty--go where they pleased, when they pleased, and hunt game\nand sell fur to traders. The government built houses for those who\ndesired to occupy them, furnished tools, seed, etc., and taught them\nhow to farm. At two of the agencies during the summer of the outbreak\nthey had several hundred acres of land under cultivation. The\ndisinclination of many of the Indians to work gradually produced\ndissension among themselves and they formed into two parties--the\nwhite man's party, those that believed in cultivating the soil; and\nthe Indian party, a sort of young-man-afraid-of-work association, who\nbelieved it beneath the dignity of the noble Dakotan to perform\nmanual labor. The white man's, or farmer's party, was favored by the\ngovernment, some of them having fine houses built for them. The other\nIndians did not like this, and became envious of them because they\ndiscontinued the customs of the tribe. There was even said to have\nbeen a secret organization among the tepee Indians whose object it was\nto declare war upon the whites. The Indians also claimed that they\nwere not fairly dealt with by the traders; that they had to rely\nentirely upon their word for their indebtedness to them; that they\nwere ignorant of any method of keeping accounts, and that when the\npaymaster came the traders generally took all that was coming, and\noften leaving many of them in debt. They protested against permitting\nthe traders to sit at the pay table of the government paymaster and\ndeduct from their small annuities the amount due them. They had at\nleast one white man's idea--they wanted to pay their debts when they\ngot ready.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor several weeks previous to the outbreak the Indians came to the\nagencies to get their money. Day after day and week after week passed\nand there was no sign of paymasters. The year 1862 was the the second\nyear of the great Rebellion, and as the government officers had been\ntaxed to their utmost to provide funds for the prosecution of the war,\nit looked as though they had neglected their wards in Minnesota. Many\nof the Indians who had gathered about the agencies were out of money\nand their families were suffering. The Indians were told that on\naccount of the great war in which the government was engaged the\npayment would never be made. Their annuities were payable in gold and\nthey were told that the great father had no gold to pay them with.\nMaj. Galbraith, the agent of the Sioux, had organized a company to go\nSouth, composed mostly of half-breeds, and this led the Indians to\nbelieve that now would be the time to go to war with the whites and\nget their land back. It was believed that the men who had enlisted\nlast had all left the state and that before, help could be sent they\ncould clear the country of the whites, and that the Winnebagos and\nChippewas would come to their assistance. It is known that the Sioux\nhad been in communication with Hole-in-the-Day, the Chippewa chief,\nbut the outbreak was probably precipitated before they came to an\nunderstanding. It was even said at the time that the Confederate\ngovernment had emissaries among them, but the Indians deny this report\nand no evidence has ever been collected proving its truthfulness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder the call of the president for 600,000 men Minnesota was called\nupon to furnish five regiments--the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth\nand Tenth--and the requisition had been partially filled and the men\nmustered in when the news reached St. Paul that open hostilities had\ncommenced at the upper agency, and an indiscriminate massacre of the\nwhites was taking place.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe people of Minnesota had been congratulating themselves that\nthey were far removed from the horrors of the Civil war, and their\nindignation knew no bounds when compelled to realize that these\ntreacherous redskins, who had been nursed and petted by officers\nof the government, and by missionaries and traders for years, had,\nwithout a moment's warning, commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of\nmen, women and children. It was a singular fact that farmer Indians,\nwhom the government officers and missionaries had tried so hard\nto civilize, were guilty of the most terrible butcheries after\nhostilities had actually commenced.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few days previous to the attack upon the whites at the upper agency\na portion of the band of Little Six appeared at Action, Meeker county.\nThere they murdered several people and then fled to Redwood. It was\nthe first step in the great massacre that soon followed. On the\nmorning of the 18th of August, without a word of warning, an\nindiscriminate massacre was inaugurated. A detachment of Company B of\nthe Fifth regiment, under command of Capt. Marsh, went to the scene\nof the revolt, but they were ambushed and about twenty-five of their\nnumber, including the captain, killed. The horrible work of murder,\npillage and destruction was spread throughout the entire Sioux\nreservation, and whole families, especially those in isolated portions\nof the country, were an easy prey to these fiendish warriors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Wyoming massacre during the Revolution and the Black Hawk and\nSeminole wars at a later period, pale into insignificance when\ncompared to the great outrages committed by these demons during this\nterrible outbreak. In less than one week 1,000 people had been killed,\nseveral million dollars' worth of property destroyed and 30,000 people\nrendered homeless. The entire country from Fort Ripley to the southern\nboundary of the state, reaching almost to the mouth of the Minnesota\nriver, had been in a twinkling depopulated. How to repel these\ninvaders and drive them back to their reservations and out of the\nstate as they had forfeited all rights to the land they had occupied,\nwas the problem that suddenly confronted both the state and national\nauthorities.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShortly after the news of the outbreak at Redwood had been received,\nword was sent from Fort Ripley to the effect that the Chippewas were\nassuming a warlike attitude, and it was feared that the Sioux and\nChippewas--hereditary enemies--had buried the hatchet, or had been\ninfluenced by other causes, and were ready to co-operate in an\nindiscriminate massacre of the whites. Indian Agent Walker undertook\nto arrest the famous chief Hole-in-the-day, but that wily warrior had\nscented danger and suddenly disappeared, with his entire band, which\ncaused grave apprehension among the settlers in that locality, and\nthey were in daily dread of an attack from these hitherto peaceable\ntribes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe suddenness with which the outbreak had occurred and the\nextraordinary rapidity with which it spread, driving the defenseless\nsettlers from their homes and causing desolation and ruin on every\nside, rendered it necessary for the governor to call an extra session\nof the legislature for the purpose of devising means to arm and equip\nvolunteers, and assist the homeless refugees in procuring places of\nshelter where they would be safe from molestation by these dusky\nwarriors. Could anything be more terrible than Gov. Ramsey's picture\nof the ravages of these outlaws in his message to the legislature?\n\"Nothing which the brutal lust and wanton cruelty of these savages\ncould wreak upon their helpless and innocent victims was omitted from\nthe category of their crimes,\" said the governor. \"Helplessness and\ninnocence, indeed, which would inspire pity in any heart but theirs,\nseemed to inspire them only with a more fiendish rage. Infants hewn\ninto bloody chips of flesh or torn untimely from the womb of the\nmurdered mother, and in cruel mockery cast in fragments on her\npulseless and bleeding breast; rape joined to murder in one awful\ntragedy; young girls, even children of tender years, outraged by\nthese brutal ravishers till death ended their shame; women held into\ncaptivity to undergo the horrors of a living death; whole families\nburned alive; and, as if their devilish fancy could not glut itself\nwith outrages on the living, the last efforts exhausted in mutilating\nthe bodies of the dead. Such are the spectacles, and a thousand\nnameless horrors besides which this first experience of Indian\nwarfare has burned into the minds and hearts of our frontier people;\nand such the enemy with whom we have to deal.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe old saying that the only good Indians are dead ones had a noble\nexception in the person of Other Day, who piloted sixty-two men,\nwomen and children across the country from below Yellow Medicine to\nKandiyohi, and from there to Hutchinson, Glencoe and Carver. Other Day\nwas an educated Indian and had been rather wild in his younger days,\nbut experienced a change of heart about four years before the outbreak\nand had adopted the habits of civilization. Other Day arrived in St.\nPaul a few days after he had piloted his party in safety to Carver,\nand in the course of a few remarks to a large audience at Ingersoll\nhall, which had assembled for the purpose of organizing a company of\nhome guards, he said: \"I am a Dakota Indian, born and reared in the\nmidst of evil. I grew up without the knowledge of any good thing. I\nhave been instructed by Americans and taught to read and write. This\nI found to be good. I became acquainted with the Sacred Writings, and\nthus learned my vileness. At the present time I have fallen into great\nevil and affliction, but have escaped from it, and with sixty-two men,\nwomen and children, without moccasins, without food and without a\nblanket, I have arrived in the midst of a great people, and now my\nheart is glad. I attribute it to the mercy of the Great Spirit.\" Other\nDay had been a member of the church for several years and his religion\ntaught him that the Great Spirit approved his conduct.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was apparent that the Indian war was on in earnest. Ex-Gov. Sibley,\non account of his long familiarity with Indian character, was placed\nin command of the troops ordered to assemble at St. Peter, and in\na few days, with detachments of the regiments then forming,\nhalf-uniformed, poorly armed and with a scant supply of ammunition,\ncommenced offensive operations against the murderous redskins. The\nnewspapers and the people were crying \"On to Ridgely!\" which was then\nbeleaguered, with the same persistency as did Horace Greeyley howl \"On\nto Richmond!\" previous to the disaster at Bull Run.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAny one who has seen the thrilling realistic Indian play of \"The Girl\nI Left Behind Me\" can form some idea of the terrible suspense of the\nlittle garrison at Port Ridgely previous to being relieved by the\nforces under command of Gen. Sibley. Fort Ridgely was a fort only\nin name, and consisted of two or three stone and several wooden\nbuildings, surrounded by a fence, which did not afford much protection\nwhen attacked by a large force. The garrison was under the command of\nLieut. T.J. Sheehan. His force consisted of about 150 men from the\nFifth regiment, fifty men of the Renville Rangers, and a number of\ncivilians. He was surrounded by 700 or 800 Sioux, fully armed and\nequipped. Although there were only two attempts made to capture the\ngarrison by assault, yet the siege was kept up for several days. In\naddition to about 300 refugees who had gathered there for support\nand protection, the $72,000 of annuity money, which had been so long\nexpected, arrived there the day before the outbreak. After bravely\ndefending the fort for more than a week, the little garrison was\nrelieved by the arrival of about 200 mounted volunteers under command\nof Col. McPhail, being the advance of Gen. Sibley's command. During\nthe siege many of the men became short of musketry ammunition, and\nspherical case shot were opened in the barracks and women worked with\nbusy hands making cartridges, while men cut nail rods in short pieces\nand used them as bullets, their dismal whistling producing terror\namong the redskins.\n\nAlmost simultaneously with the attack on Fort Ridgely the Indians in\nlarge numbers appeared in the vicinity of New Ulm, with the evident\nintention of burning and pillaging the village. Judge Charles E.\nFlandrau of this city, who was then residing at St. Peter, organized a\ncompany of volunteers and marched across the country to the relief of\nthat place. The judge received several acquisitions to his force while\nen route, and when he arrived at New Ulm found himself in command of\nabout 300 men, poorly armed and wholly without military experience.\nThey arrived at New Ulm just in time to assist the inhabitants in\ndriving the Indians from the upper part of the village, several\ncitizens having been killed and a number of houses burned. Two or\nthree days afterward the Indians appeared in large force, surrounded\nthe town and commenced burning the buildings on its outskirts. After\na desperate encounter, in which the force under command of Judge\nFlandrau lost ten killed and about forty wounded, the Indians retired.\nThere were in the village at the time of the attack about 1,200 or\n1,500 noncombatants, and every one of them would have been killed had\nthe Indian attack been successful. Provisions and ammunition becoming\nscarce, the judge decided to evacuate the town and march across the\ncountry to Mankato. They made up a train of about 150 wagons, loaded\nthem with women and children and the men who had been wounded in the\nfight, and arrived safely in Mankato without being molested. Nearly\ntwo hundred houses were burned before the town was evacuated, leaving\nnothing standing but a few houses inside the hastily constructed\nbarricade. The long procession of families leaving their desolated\nhomes, many of them never to return, formed one of the saddest scenes\nin the history of the outbreak, and will ever be remembered by the\ngallant force under the command of Judge Flandrau, who led them to a\nplace of safety.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as Gen. Sibley arrived at Fort Ridgely a detail of Company A\nof the Sixth regiment, under command of Capt. H.P. Grant of St. Paul,\nand seventy members of the Cullen Guards, under the command of Capt.\nJo Anderson, also of St. Paul, and several citizen volunteers,\nall under the command of Maj. Joseph R. Brown, was sent out with\ninstructions to bury the dead and rescue the wounded, if any could\nbe found, from their perilous surroundings. They were St. Paul\norganizations and most all of their members were St. Paul boys. They\nnever had had an opportunity to drill and most of them were not\nfamiliar with the use of firearms. After marching for two days, during\nwhich time they interred a large number of victims of the savage\nSioux, they went into camp at Birch Coulie, about fifteen miles from\nFort Ridgely. The encampment was on the prairie near a fringe of\ntimber and the coulie on one side and an elevation of about ten feet\non the other. It was a beautiful but very unfortunate location for the\ncommand to camp, and would probably not have been selected had it been\nknown that they were surrounded by 400 or 500 hostile warriors. Maj.\nBrown had about one hundred and fifty men under his command. About 4\no'clock on the following morning the Indians, to the number of 500 or\n600, well armed and most of them mounted, commenced an indiscriminate\nfire upon the almost helpless little command. For two days they\nbravely defended themselves, and when relief finally arrived it was\nfound that about half their number had been killed or wounded. When\nthe news of the disaster reached St. Paul there was great excitement.\nRelatives and friends of the dead and wounded were outspoken in\ntheir denunciation of the civil and military authorities who were\nresponsible for this great sacrifice of the lives of our citizens. It\nwas feared that the city itself was in danger of an attack from the\nsavages. Home guards were organized and the bluffs commanding a view\nof the city were nightly patrolled by citizen volunteers. There was no\ntelegraph at that time and rumors of all sorts were flying thick\nand fast. Every courier reaching the city would bring news of fresh\noutrages, and our panic-stricken citizens had hardly time to recover\nfrom the effect of one disaster before the news of another would be\nreceived. Settlers fleeing from their homes for places of safety were\narriving by the score, leaving crops to perish in the field and their\nhouses to be destroyed. The situation was appalling, and many of our\ncitizens were predicting the most direful results should the army fail\nto check the savage hordes in their work of devastation and ruin.\n\nEvery boat from the Minnesota river would be crowded with refugees,\nand the people of St. Paul were often called upon to assist in\nforwarding them to their place of destination.\n\nHome guards were organized in almost every village of the threatened\nportion of the state, but the authorities could not furnish arms\nor ammunition and their services would have been of little account\nagainst the well-armed savages in case they had been attacked.\n\nAdvertisements appeared in the St. Paul newspapers offering rewards of\n$25 a piece for Sioux scalps.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGov. Ramsey endeavored to allay the apprehensions of the people and\npublished in the papers a statement to the effect that the residents\nof the Capital City need not be alarmed, as the nearest approach of\nthe Indians was at Acton, Meeker county, 80 miles away; Fort Ripley,\n150 miles away, and the scenes of the tragedy in Yellow Medicine\ncounty, 210 miles distant. This may have been gratifying to the\nresidents of the Capital City, but was far from reassuring to the\nfrontiersmen who were compelled to abandon their homes and were\nseeking the protection of the slowly advancing militia.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout 12 o'clock one night during the latter part of August a report\nwas circulated over the northern and western portion of St. Paul that\nthe savages were near the city, and many women and children were\naroused from their slumber and hastily dressed and sought the\nprotection of the city authorities. It was an exciting but rather\namusing episode in the great tragedy then taking place on the\nfrontier. Rumors of this character were often circulated, and it was\nnot until after the battle of Wood Lake that the people of St. Paul\nfelt that they were perfectly safe from raids by the hostile Sioux.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as Gen. Sibley had collected a sufficient force to enable\nhim to move with safety he decided upon offensive operations. He had\ncollected about 2,000 men from the regiments then forming, including\nthe Third regiment, recently paroled, and a battery under command of\nCapt. Mark Hendricks. The expedition marched for two or three days\nwithout encountering opposition, but on the morning of the 23d of\nSeptember several foraging parties belonging to the Third regiment\nwere fired upon in the vicinity of Wood Lake. About 800 of the command\nwere engaged in the encounter and were opposed by about an equal\nnumber of Indians. After a spirited engagement Col. Marshall, with\nabout 400 men, made a double-quick charge upon the Sioux and succeeded\nin utterly routing them. Our loss was four killed and forty or fifty\nwounded. This was the only real battle of the war. Other Day was with\nthe whites and took a conspicuous part in the encounter. After\nthe battle Gen. Pope, who was in command of the department of the\nNorthwest, telegraphed the war department that the Indian war was\nover and asked what disposition to make of the troops then under his\ncommand. This request of Gen. Pope was met with a decided remonstrance\nby the people of Minnesota, and they succeeded in preventing the\nremoval of any of the troops until they had made two long marches\nthrough the Dakotas and to Montana. Gen. Sibley's command reached Camp\nRelease on the 26th of September, in the vicinity of which was\nlocated a large camp of Indians, most of whom had been engaged in the\nmassacres. They had with them about two hundred and fifty mixed bloods\nand white women and children, and the soldiers were very anxious to\nprecede at once to their rescue. Gen. Sibley was of the opinion that\nany hostile demonstration would mean the annihilation of all the\nprisoners, and therefore proceeded with the utmost caution. After a\nfew preliminary consultations the entire camp surrendered and the\ncaptives were released. As soon as possible Gen. Sibley made inquiries\nas to the participation of these Indians in the terrible crimes\nrecently perpetrated, and it soon developed that a large number of\nthem had been guilty of the grossest atrocities. The general decided\nto form a military tribunal and try the offenders. After a series of\nsittings, lasting from the 30th of September to the 5th of November,\n321 of the fiends were found guilty of the offenses charged, 303 of\nwhom were sentenced to death and the rest condemned to various terms\nof imprisonment according to their crimes. All of the condemned\nprisoners were taken to Mankato and were confined in a large jail\nconstructed for the purpose. After the court-martial had completed\nits work and the news of its action had reached the Eastern cities,\na great outcry was made that Minnesota was contemplating a wholesale\nslaughter of the beloved red man. The Quakers of Philadelphia and the\ngood people of Massachusetts sent many remonstrances to the president\nto put a stop to the proposed wholesale execution. The president,\nafter consulting his military advisers, decided to permit the\nexecution of only thirty-eight of the most flagrant cases, and\naccordingly directed them to be hung on the 26th of December, 1862.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrevious to their execution the condemned prisoners were interviewed\nby Rev. S.R. Riggs, to whom they made their dying confessions. Nearly\nevery one of them claimed to be innocent of the crimes charged to\nthem. Each one had some word to send to his parents or family, and\nwhen speaking of their wives and children almost every one was\naffected to tears. Most of them spoke confidently of their hope of\nsalvation, and expected to go at once to the abode of the Great\nSpirit. Rattling Runner, who was a son-in-law of Wabasha, dictated the\nfollowing letter, which is a sample of the confessions made to Dr.\nRiggs: \"Wabasha, you have deceived me. You told me if we followed the\nadvice of Gen. Sibley and gave ourselves up, all would be well--no\ninnocent man would be injured. I have not killed or injured a white\nman or any white person. I have not participated in the plunder of\ntheir property; and yet to-day I am set apart for execution and must\ndie, while men who are guilty will remain in prison. My wife is your\ndaughter, my children are your grandchildren. I leave them all in your\ncare and under your protection. Do not let them suffer, and when they\nare grown up let them know that their father died because he followed\nthe advice of his chief, and without having the blood of a white man\nto answer for to the Holy Spirit. My wife and children are dear to me.\nLet them not grieve for me; let them remember that the brave should be\nprepared to meet death, and I will do as becomes a Dakotah.\"\n\nWabasha was a Sioux chief, and although he was not found guilty of\nparticipating in any of the massacres of women and children, he was\nprobably in all the most important battles. Wabasha county, and\nWabasha street in St. Paul were named after his father.\n\nAfter the execution the bodies were taken down, loaded into wagons and\ncarried down to a sandbar in front of the city, where they were all\ndumped into the same hole. They did not remain there long, but were\nspirited away by students and others familiar with the use of a\ndissecting knife.\n\nLittle Crow, the chief instigator of the insurrection was not with the\nnumber that surrendered, but escaped and was afterward killed by a\nfarmer named Lamson, in the vicinity of Hutchinson. His scalp is now\nin the state historical society. Little Crow was born in Kaposia, a\nfew miles below St. Paul, and was always known as a bad Indian. Little\nCrow's father was friendly to the whites, and it was his dying wish\nthat his son should assume the habits of civilized life and accustom\nhimself to the new order of things, but the dying admonitions of the\nold man were of little avail and Little Crow soon became a dissolute,\nquarrelsome and dangerous Indian. He was opposed to all change of\ndress and habits of life, and was very unfriendly to missionaries and\nteachers. He was seldom known to tell the truth and possessed very few\nredeeming qualities. Although greatly disliked by many of the Indians,\nhe was the acknowledged head of the war party and by common consent\nassumed the direction of all the hostile tribes in their fruitless\nstruggle against the whites.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBetween the conviction and execution of the condemned Indians there\nwas great excitement throughout the Minnesota valley lest the\npresident should pardon the condemned. Meetings were held throughout\nthe valley and organizations were springing into existence for the\npurpose of overpowering the strong guard at Mankato and wreaking\nsummary justice upon the Indians. The situation became so serious\npending the decision of the president that the governor was compelled\nto issue a proclamation calling upon all good citizens not to tarnish\nthe fair name of the state by an act of lawlessness that the outside\nworld would never forget, however great was the provocation. When\nthe final order came to execute only thirty-eight there was great\ndisappointment. Petitions were circulated in St. Paul and generally\nsigned favoring the removal of the condemned Indians to Massachusetts\nto place them under the refining influence of the constituents of\nSenator Hoar, the same people who are now so terribly shocked because\na humane government is endeavoring to prevent, in the Philippines, a\nrepetition of the terrible atrocities committed in Minnesota.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe balance of the condemned were kept in close confinement till\nspring, when they were taken to Davenport, and afterward to some point\non the Missouri river, where a beneficent government kindly permitted\nthem to sow the seed of discontent that finally culminated in the\nCuster massacre. When it was known that the balance of the condemned\nIndians were to be transported to Davenport by steamer. St. Paul\npeople made preparations to give them a warm reception as they passed\ndown the river, but their intentions were frustrated by the government\nofficers in charge of their removal, as they arranged to have the\nsteamer Favorite, on which they were to be transported, pass by the\ncity in the middle of the night. St. Paul people were highly indignant\nwhen apprised of their escape.\n\nLittle Six and Medicine Bottle, two Sioux chiefs engaged in the\noutbreak, were arrested at Fort Gary (Winnipeg), and delivered at\nPembina in January, 1864, and were afterward taken to Fort Snelling,\nwhere they were tried, condemned and executed in the presence of\n10,000 people, being the last of the Indians to receive capital\npunishment for their great crimes. Little Six confessed to having\nmurdered fifty white men, women and children.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the most perplexing problems the military authorities had to\ncontend with was the transportation of supplies to the troops on the\nfrontier. There were, of course, no railroads, and the only way to\ntransport provisions was by wagon. An order was issued by the military\nauthorities requesting the tender of men and teams for this purpose,\nbut the owners of draft horses did not respond with sufficient\nalacrity to supply the pressing necessities of the army, and it\nwas necessary for the authorities to issue another order forcibly\nimpressing into service of the government any and all teams that could\nbe found on the streets or in stables. A detachment of Company K of\nthe Eighth regiment was sent down from the fort and remained in the\ncity several days on that especial duty. As soon as the farmers heard\nthat the government was taking possession of everything that came over\nthe bridge they ceased hauling their produce to the city and carried\nit to Hastings. There was one silver-haired farmer living near the\ncity limits by the name of Hilks, whose sympathies were entirely with\nthe South, and he had boasted that all of Uncle Sam's hirelings could\nnot locate his team. One of the members of Company K was a former\nneighbor of the disloyal farmer, and he made it his particular duty\nto see that this team, at least, should be loyal to the government. A\nclose watch was kept on him, and one morning he was seen to drive down\nto the west side of the bridge and tie his team behind a house, where\nhe thought they would be safe until he returned. As soon as the old\nman passed over the bridge the squad took possession of his horses,\nand when he returned the team was on the way to Abercrombie laden\nwith supplies for the troops at the fort. Of course the government\nsubsequently reimbursed the owners of the teams for their use, but in\nthis particular case the soldiers did not think the owner deserved it.\n\nGov. Ramsey's carriage team was early taken possession of by the\nmilitary squad, and when the driver gravely informed the officer in\ncharge that the governor was the owner of that team and he thought it\nexempt from military duty, he was suavely informed that a power\nhigher than the governor required that team and that it must go to\nAbercrombie. And it did.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was necessary to send out a large escort with these supply trains\nand It was easier to procure men for that purpose than it was for the\nregular term of enlistment. On one of the trains that left St. Paul\nwas a young man by the name of Hines. He was as brave as Julius\nCaesar. He said so himself. He was so heavily loaded with various\nweapons of destruction that his companions called him a walking\narsenal. If Little Crow had attacked this particular train the Indian\nwar would have ended. This young man had been so very demonstrative of\nhis ability to cope with the entire Sioux force that his companions\nresolved to test his bravery. One night when the train was camped\nabout half way between St. Cloud and Sauk Center, several of the\nguards attached to the train painted their faces, arrayed themselves\nin Indian costume and charged through the camp, yelling the Indian war\nhoop and firing guns in every direction. Young Hines was the first to\nhear the alarm, and didn't stop running until he reached St. Cloud,\nspreading the news in every direction that the entire tribe of\nLittle Crow was only a short distance behind. Of course there was\nconsternation along the line of this young man's masterly retreat,\nand it was some time before the panic-stricken citizens knew what had\nactually happened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn response to the appeal of Gov. Sibley and other officers on the\nfrontier, the ladies of St. Paul early organized for the purpose of\nfurnishing sick and wounded soldiers with such supplies as were not\nobtainable through the regular channels of the then crude condition of\nthe various hospitals. Notices like the following often appeared in\nthe daily papers at that time: \"Ladies Aid Society--A meeting of the\nladies' aid society for the purpose of sewing for the relief of the\nwounded soldiers at our forts, and also for the assistance of the\ndestitute refugees now thronging our city, is called to meet this\nmorning at Ingersoll hall. All ladies interested in this object are\nearnestly invited to attend. All contributions of either money or\nclothing will be thankfully received. By order of the president,\n\n\"Mrs. Stella Selby.\n\n\"Miss M.O. Holyoke, Secretary.\"\n\nMrs. Selby was the wife of John W. Selby, one of the first residents\nof the city, Miss Holyoke was the Clara Barton of Minnesota, devoting\nher whole time and energy to the work of collecting sanitary supplies\nfor the needy soldiers in the hospitals.\n\nScores of poor soldiers who were languishing in hospital tents on\nthe sunburnt and treeless prairies of the Dakotas, or suffering from\ndisease contracted in the miasmatic swamps of the rebellious South\nhave had their hearts gladdened and their bodies strengthened by being\nsupplied with the delicacies collected through the efforts of\nthe noble and patriotic ladies of this and kindred organizations\nthroughout the state.\n\nMany instances are recorded of farmers leaving their harvesters in the\nfield and joining the grand army then forming for the defense of the\nimperilled state and nation, while their courageous and energetic\nwives have gone to the fields and finished harvesting the ripened\ncrops.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy reason of the outbreak the Sioux forfeited to the government, in\naddition to an annual annuity of $68,000 for fifty years, all the\nlands they held in Minnesota, amounting in the aggregate to about\n750,000 acres, worth at the present time something like $15,000,000.\nHad they behaved themselves and remained In possession of this immense\ntract of land, they would have been worth twice as much per capita as\nany community in the United States.\n\n\n\n\nFIREMEN AND FIRES OF PIONEER DAYS.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ST. PAUL, FIRE DEPARTMENT--PIONEER HOOK AND\nLADDER COMPANY--HOPE ENGINE COMPANY AND MINNEHAHA ENGINE COMPANY--A\nLARGE NUMBER OF HOTEL FIRES.\n\n\nWHEN WE RAN WITH THE OLD MACHINE.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  Brave relics of the past are we,\n    Old firemen, staunch and true,\n  We're thinking now of days gone by\n    And all that we've gone through.\n  Thro' fire and flames we've made our way,\n    And danger we have seen;\n  We never can forget the time\n    When we ran with the old machine.\n\n  In numbers now we are but few,\n  A host have pased away,\n  But still we're happy, light and free,\n    Our spirits never decay\n  We often sigh for those old days\n    Whose memory we keep green,\n  Oh! there was joy for man and boy,\n    When we ran with the old machine.\n                         --Gus Wiliams.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInstruments for extinguishing fires were introduced in various parts\nof Europe more than three hundred years ago. The fire laddies of that\nperiod would probably look aghast if they could see the implements\nin use at the present time. One of the old time machines is said to\nconsist of a huge tank of water placed upon wheels, drawn by a large\nnumber of men, and to which was attached a small hose. When the water\nin the tank became exhausted it was supplied by a bucket brigade,\nsomething on the plan in use at the present time in villages not able\nto support an engine.\n\nThe oldest record of a fire engine in Paris was one used in the king's\nlibrary in 1684, which, having but one cylinder, threw water to a\ngreat height, a result obtained by the use of an air chamber. Leather\nhose was introduced into Amsterdam in 1670, by two Dutchmen, and they\nalso invented the suction pipe at about the same period. About the\nclose of the seventeenth century an improved engine was patented in\nEngland. It was a strong cistern of oak placed upon wheels, furnished\nwith a pump, an air chamber and a suction pipe of strong leather,\nthrough which run a spiral piece of metal. This engine was little\nimproved until the early part of the last century.\n\nIn the United States bucket fire departments were organized in most of\nthe cities in the early part of the last century, and hand engines,\nused by the old volunteer firemen, did not come into general use until\nabout fifty years later. The New York volunteer fire department was\nfor a long time one of the institutions of the country. When they had\ntheir annual parade the people of the surrounding towns would flock\nto the city and the streets would be as impassible as they are to-day\nwhen a representative of one of the royal families of Europe is placed\non exhibition. At the New York state fairs during the early '50s the\ntournaments of the volunteer fire department of the various cities\nthroughout the state formed one of the principal attractions. Many\na melee occurred between the different organizations because they\nconsidered that they had not been properly recognized in the line of\nmarch or had not been awarded a medal for throwing a stream of water\nfarther than other competitors.\n\nA Berlin correspondent of the Pioneer Press many years ago, said that\nwhen an alarm of fire was sounded in the city, the members of the fire\ncompanies would put on their uniforms and report to their various\nengine houses. When a sufficient number had assembled to make a\nshowing the foreman would call the roll, beer would be passed down the\nline, the health of the kaiser properly remembered and then they would\nstart out in search of the fire. As a general thing the fire would\nbe out long before they arrived upon the scene, and they would then\nreturn to their quarters, have another beer and be dismissed.\n\nTo Cincinnati belongs the credit of having introduced the first paid\nsteam fire department in the United States, but all the other large\ncities rapidly followed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the fall of 1850 the town fathers of St. Paul passed an ordinance\nrequiring the owners of all buildings, public or private, to provide\nand keep in good repair, substantial buckets, marked with paint the\nword \"Fire\" on one side and the owner's name on the other, subject\nto inspection by the fire warden and to be under his control when\noccasion required. The first attempt at organizing a fire brigade, was\nmade by R.C. Knox in the fall of 1851. Mr. Knox raised a small sum of\nmoney by subscription, with which he purchased several ladders, and\nthey were frequently brought into requisition by the little band of\nmen whom Mr. Knox had associated with him. Mr. Knox was a man of\nenormous stature, and it was said he could tire out a dozen ordinary\nmen at a fire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo public-spirited citizens of St. Paul, John McCloud and Thompson\nRitchie, purchased in the East and brought to the city at their own\nexpense the first fire engine introduced in the Northwest. Although\nit was a miniature affair, on numerous occasions it rendered valuable\nassistance in protecting the property of our pioneer merchants. Mr.\nRitchie is still living, his home being in Philadelphia.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn November, 1854, Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 was organized\nunder provisions of the city charter. A constitution and by-laws were\nadopted and the members agreed to turn out promptly on all occasions\nof fire alarms. As compensation for their services they were excused\nfrom jury duty, poll tax, work on the roads, or state military\nservice, for the period of five years. The original constitution of\nthe Pioneer Hook and Ladder company contained the following membership\nroll: Foreman, Isaac A. Banker; assistant foremen, H.B. Pearson and\nGeorge F. Blake; treasurer, Richard Galloway; secretary, Robert Mason;\nmembers, Henry Buell, John W. Cathcart, Charles D. Elfelt, Edward\nHeenan, Thompson Ritchie, Philip Ross, Wash. M. Stees, J.W. Stevenson,\nBenjamin F. Irvine, R.I. Thomson, John McCloud, J.Q.A. Ward, Charles\nJ. Williams. Of the above John McCloud is the only one living in the\ncity at the present time. Mr. McCloud was a member of the firm of\nMcCloud & Bro., hardware dealers, and they occupied the building on\nthe southwest corner of Third and Cedar streets.\n\nThis was the first full-fledged fire organization in the city, and as\nMr. McCloud took the initiative in forming this company he may justly\nbe called the \"Father of the Volunteer Fire Department of St. Paul.\"\n\nThe old hook and ladder company was one of the representative\ninstitutions of the city. From the date of its organization up to the\ntime of the establishment of the paid fire department many of the most\nprominent men of the city were enrolled among its members. All of the\nproperty of the company was owned by the organization, but in 1856,\nhaving become somewhat financially embarrassed, their accounts were\nturned over to the city and they were thereafter under the control of\nthe city fathers. At that time they possessed one truck, hooks and\nladders, and one fire engine with hose. Washington M. Stees was\nmade chief engineer and Charles H. Williams assistant. This scanty\nequipment did not prove adequate for extinguishing fires and petitions\nwere circulated requesting the council to purchase two fire engines of\nthe more approved pattern, and also to construct a number of cisterns\nin the central part of the city, so that an adequate supply of water\ncould be readily obtained. The city fathers concluded to comply with\nthe request of the petitioners and they accordingly purchased two\ndouble-deck hand fire engines and they arrived in the city in August,\n1858. They were soon tested and pronounced satisfactory. Our citizens\nthen congratulated themselves upon the possession of a first-class\nfire department and they predicted that thereafter a great fire would\nbe a thing of the past.\n\nOne of the most irrepressible members of Pioneer Hook and Ladder\ncompany in the early days was a little red-headed Irishman by the name\nof A.D. Martin. He was foreman of the Daily Minnesotian office and he\nusually went by the name of \"Johnny Martin.\" Now Johnny always kept\nhis fire paraphernalia close at hand, and every time a fire bell\nsounded he was \"Johnny on the spot.\" After the fire was over Johnny\ngenerally had to celebrate, and every time Johnny celebrated he would\nmake a solemn declaration that it was his duty to kill an Irishman\nbefore he returned to work. He would accordingly provide himself with\nan immense Derringer and start out in quest of a subject upon whom he\nproposed to execute his sanguinary threat. Strange to relate he\nnever succeeded in finding one of his unfortunate countrymen, and it\ngenerally required two or three days to restore him to his former\nequilibrium. If Johnny was a member of the fire department to-day he\nwould probably discover that the task of finding one of his countrymen\nwould not be so difficult.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn 1857 Hope Engine Company No. 1 was organized, and they petitioned\nthe common council to purchase 500 feet of hose for their use. In\nthe fall of 1858 this company was given possession of one of the new\nengines recently purchased and it was comfortably housed at their\nheadquarters in an old frame building on the southwest corner of\nFranklin and Fourth streets, and in a short time removed to a new\nbrick building on Third street, fronting on Washington. Michael Leroy\nwas made the first foreman and R.C. Wiley and Joseph S. Herey were\nhis assistants. The membership contained the names of John H. Dodge,\nPorteus Dodge, John E. Missen, Joseph Elfelt, Fred Whipperman, John T.\nToal, J.H. Barstow, J.C. Grand, Charles Riehl, John Raguet, E. Rhodes,\nB. Bradley, Charles Hughes, Bird Boesch, T.F. Masterson, John J.\nWilliams and V. Metzger. During the fall of 1858 a large number of the\nmost prominent business men in the vicinity of Seven Corners joined\nthe organization and continued in active membership until the arrival\nof the first steamer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the winter of 1857-1858 Minnehaha Engine. Company No. 2 was\norganized, and it was provided with an engine house near the corner\nof Third and Jackson streets. The first officers were H.P. Grant,\nforeman; M.J. O'Connor and H.B. Terwilliger, assistants; members,\nHarry M. Shaw, Nicholas Hendy, John B. Oliver, F.A. Cariveau, H.A.\nSchlick. C.D. Hadway, N. Nicuhaus, L.R. Storing, William T. Donaldson,\nDaniel Rohrer, J. Fletcher Williams, N. W. Kittson, Alfred Bayace,\nJohn McCauley and a number of others. The Minnehahas were a prosperous\norganization from the first, and their engine house was always kept\nopen and served as a general lounging and reading-room for such of its\nmembers as had nothing particular to do.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRotary Independent Company No. 1 was the third engine connected with\nthe St. Paul fire department, but that was a private institution and\nwas only used when there was a general alarm and on the days of the\nannual parade of the department. This engine was purchased from the\ngovernment by John S. Prince when Fort Snelling was abandoned, and was\nused for the protection of the property of the mill, which was located\non lower Third street.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the formation of Minnehaha Engine company the city fathers thought\nthey were possessed of quite a respectable fire department, and from\nthat time on the annual parade of the St. Paul fire department was one\nof the events of the year. The first parade occurred on the 12th\nof September, 1859, and was participated in by the following\norganizations:\n\n  Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1.\n  Hope Engine Company No. 1.\n  Minnehaha Engine Company No. 2.\n  Rotary Independent Company No. 1.\n\nThese four companies numbered 175 men, and after completing their line\nof march were reviewed by the mayor and common council in front of the\nold city hall.\n\nIn 1858 the legislature passed an act requiring the sextons of the\ndifferent churches to ring the church bells fifteen minutes whenever\nthere was an alarm of fire. The uptown churches would ring their\nbells, the downtown churches would ring their bells, and the churches\nin the central part of the city would ring their bells. There was a\nregular banging and clanging of the bells.\n\n  \"In the startled air of night,\n  They would scream out their afright,\n  Too much horrified to speak,\n  They could only shriek, shriek,\n  Out of tune.\"\n\nEvery one turned out when the fire bells rang. Unless the fire was of\nsufficient volume to be readily located, the uptown people would be\nseen rushing downtown, and the downtown people would be seen rushing\nuptown, in fact, general pandemonium prevailed until the exact\nlocation of the fire could be determined.\n\nWhenever there was a large fire the regular firemen would soon tire\nof working on the brakes and they would appeal to the spectators to\nrelieve them for a short time. As a general thing the appeal would be\nreadily responded to, but occasionally it would be necessary for the\npolice to impress into service a force sufficient to keep the brakes\nworking. Any person refusing to work on the brakes was liable to\narrest and fine, and it was often amusing to see the crowds disperse\nwhenever the police were in search of a relief force.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUpon the breaking out of the war a large number of the firemen\nenlisted in the defense of the country and the ranks of the department\nwere sadly decimated. It was during the early part of the war that the\nmayor of St. Paul made a speech to the firemen at the close of their\nannual parade in which he referred to them as being as brave if not\nbraver than the boys at the front. The friends of the boys in blue\ntook serious umbrage at this break of the mayor, and the press of the\ncity and throughout the state were very indignant to think that the\ncapital city possessed a mayor of doubtful loyalty. The excitement\nsoon died away and the mayor was re-elected by a large majority.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was not much change in the condition of the department until\nthe arrival of the first steamer, Aug. 11, 1866. The new steamer was\nlodged with Hope Engine company, and an engineer and fireman appointed\nat a salary of $1,600 per year for the two. The boys of Hope Engine\ncompany did not like the selection of the engineer of the new steamer\nand took the matter so seriously that their organization was disbanded\nand St. Paul Hose Company No. 1 was organized, and they took charge\nof the new steamer. The rapid growth of the city necessitated the\nfrequent purchase of new fire apparatus, and at the present time the\nSt. Paul fire department has 211 paid men, 15 steamers, 4 chemicals, 8\nhook and ladder companies and 122 horses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe volunteer fire department had no better friend than the late Mrs.\nBartlett Presley. She was the guardian angel of the fire department.\nNo night so cold or storm so great that Mrs. Presley was not present\nand with her own hands provide coffee and sandwiches for the tired and\nhungry firemen who had been heroically battling with the flames. She\nwas an honored guest at all entertainments with which the firemen\nwere connected, and was always toasted and feasted by the boys at the\nbrakes. She will ever be remembered, not only by the firemen, but by\nall old settlers, as one of the many noble women in St. Paul whose\nunostentatious deeds of charity have caused a ray of sunshine in many\nsad homes.\n\nMrs. Presley's death was deeply regretted, not only by the fire\ndepartment, but by every resident of the city.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmong the many brilliant members of the legal fraternity in St. Paul\nin early times no one possessed a more enviable reputation than\nthe Hon. Michael E. Ames. He was the very personification of\npunctiliousness and always displayed sublime imperturbability in\nexigencies of great moment. One dreary winter night his sleeping\napartment in uppertown was discovered to be on fire, and in a short\ntime the fire laddies appeared in front of his quarters and commenced\noperations. As soon as Mr. Ames discovered the nature of the\ndisturbance he arose from his bed, opened the window, and with\noutstretched arms and in a supplicating manner, as if addressing a\njury in an important case, exclaimed: \"Gentlemen, if you will be kind\nenough to desist from operations until I arrange my toilet, I will be\ndown.\" The learned counsel escaped with his toilet properly adjusted,\nbut his apartments were soon incinerated.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHOTEL FIRES.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLIST OF HOTELS DESTROYED BY FIRE DURING ST.

A\nstrong wind was raging and the little band of firemen were unable\nto save the structure. The names of Rev. D.D. Neill, Isaac Markley,\nBartlett Presley and W.M. Stees were among the firemen who assisted in\nsaving the furniture.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Sintominie hotel on the corner of Sixth and John streets, was the\nsecond hotel to receive a visit from the fire king. This hotel was\nconstructed by the late C.W. Borup, and it was the pride of lower\ntown. Howard Ward and E.C. Rich were preparing to open it when the\nfire occurred. Owing to the lack of fire protection the building was\ntotally destroyed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly in the winter of 1856 the Rice house, commonly supposed to\nbe the first brick building erected in St. Paul, was burned to the\nground. It was three stories high, and when in process of building was\nconsidered a visionary enterprise. The building was constructed by\nHenry M. Rice, and he spared no expense to make it as complete as the\ntimes would allow. It was situated on Third street near Market, and\nin the early days was considered St. Paul's principal hotel. In its\nparlor and barroom the second session of the territorial legislature\nwas held, and the supreme court of the territory also used it for\nseveral terms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Canada house and the Galena house, two small frame structures on\nRobert near Third, were the next hotels to be visited by the fiery\nelement. These hotels, though small, were well patronized at the time\nof their destruction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the 16th of March, 1860, the most destructive fire that had ever\noccurred in St. Paul broke out in a small wooden building on Third\nstreet near Jackson, and though the entire fire department--three\nengines and one truck, manned by one hundred men--were promptly on\nhand, the flames rapidly got beyond their reach. Nearly all the\nbuildings on Third street at that time from Robert to Jackson were\ntwo-story frame structures, and in their rear were small houses\noccupied by the owners of the stores. When the fire was at its height\nit was feared that the whole of lower town would be destroyed before\nthe flames could be subdued, but by dint of superhuman effort the\nfiremen managed to cut off the leap across Robert street and soon had\nthe immense smouldering mass under control. Thirty-four buildings, the\nlargest number ever destroyed in St. Paul, were in ashes. Of the two\nblocks which lined the north and south sides of Third street above\nJackson, only three buildings were left standing, two being stone\nstructures occupied by Beaumont & Gordon and Bidwell & Co., and\nthe other a four-story brick building owned and occupied by A.L.\nLarpenteur. The New England, a two-story log house, and one of the\nfirst hotels built in St. Paul was among the ruins. The New England\nwas a feature in St. Paul, and it was pointed out to newcomers as the\nfirst gubernatorial mansion, and in which Gov. and Mrs. Ramsey had\nbegun housekeeping in 1849. The Empire saloon was another historic\nruin, for in its main portion the first printing office of the\nterritory had long held forth, and from it was issued the first\nPioneer, April 10, 1849. The Hotel to the Wild Hunter was also\ndestroyed at this fire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the fall of 1862 the Winslow house, located at Seven Corners, was\nentirely destroyed by fire. A defective stovepipe in the cupola caused\nthe fire, and it spread so rapidly that it was beyond the control\nof the firemen when they arrived upon the scene. A few pieces of\nfurniture, badly damaged, was all that was saved of this once popular\nhotel. The Winslow was a four-story brick building, and with the\nexception of the Fuller house the largest hotel in the city. The hotel\nwas constructed in 1854 by the late J.M. Winslow. Mr. Winslow was one\nof the most ingenious hotel constructors in the West. In some peculiar\nmanner he was enabled to commence the construction of a building\nwithout any capital, but when the building was completed he not only\nhad the building, but a bank account that indicated that he was a\nfinancier as well as a builder. The proprietors of the Winslow were\narrested for incendarism, but after a preliminary examination were\ndischarged.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe American house, on the corner of Third and Exchange streets, was\none of the landmarks of the city for a good many years. It was built\nin 1849, and the territorial politicians generally selected this hotel\nas their headquarters. Although it was of very peculiar architecture,\nthe interior fittings were of a modern character. On a stormy night in\nthe month of December, 1863, an alarm of fire was sent in from this\nhotel, but before the fire department reached the locality the fire\nwas beyond their control. The weather was bitter cold, and the water\nwould be frozen almost as soon as it left the hose. Finding their\nefforts fruitless to save the building, the firemen turned their\nattention to saving the guests. There were some very narrow escapes,\nbut no accidents of a very serious nature. As usual, thieves were\npresent and succeeded in carrying off a large amount of jewelry and\nwearing apparel belonging to the guests.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the year of 1856 Mackubin & Edgerton erected a fine three-story\nbrick building on the corner of Third and Franklin streets. It was\noccupied by them as a banking house for a long time. The business\ncenter having been moved further down the street, they were compelled\nto seek quarters on Bridge Square. After the bank moved out of\nthis building it was leased to Bechtner & Kottman, and was by them\nremodeled into a hotel on the European plan at an expense of about\n$20,000. It was named the Cosmopolitan hotel, and was well patronized.\nWhen the alarm of fire was given it was full of lodgers, many of whom\nlost all they possessed. The Linden theatrical company, which was\nplaying at the Athenaeum, was among the heavy sufferers. At this fire\na large number of frame buildings on the opposite side of the street\nwere destroyed.\n\nWhen the Cosmopolitan hotel burned the walls of the old building were\nleft standing, and although they were pronounced dangerous by the city\nauthorities, had not been demolished. Dr. Schell, one of the best\nknown physicians of the city, occupied a little frame building near\nthe hotel, and he severely denounced the city authorities for their\nlax enforcement of the law. One night at 10 o'clock the city was\nvisited by a terrific windstorm, and suddenly a loud crash was heard\nin the vicinity of the doctor's office. A portion of the walls of the\nhotel had fallen and the little building occupied by the doctor had\nbeen crushed in. The fire alarm was turned on and the fire laddies\nwere soon on the spot. No one supposed the doctor was alive, but after\nthe firemen had been at work a short time they could hear the voice\nof the doctor from underneath the rubbish. In very vigorous English,\nwhich the doctor knew so well how to use, he roundly upbraided the\nfire department for not being more expeditious in extricating him from\nhis perilous position. After the doctor had been taken out of the\nruins It was found that he had not been seriously injured, and in the\ncourse of a few weeks was able to resume practice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the winter of 1868 the Emmert house, situated on Bench street\nnear Wabasha, was destroyed by fire. The Emmert house was built in\nterritorial times by Fred Emmert, who for some time kept a hotel and\nboarding house at that place. It had not been used for hotel purposes\nfor some time, but was occupied by a  family and used as a\nboarding-house for <DW52> people. While the flames were rapidly\nconsuming the old building the discovery was made that a man and\nhis wife were sick in one of the rooms with smallpox. The crowd of\nonlookers fled in terror, and they would have been burned alive had\nnot two courageous firemen carried them out of the building. It was\nan unusually cold night and the <DW52> people were dumped into the\nmiddle of the street and there allowed to remain. They were provided\nwith clothing and some of the more venturesome even built a fire for\nthem, but no one would volunteer to take them to a place of shelter.\nAbout 10 o'clock on the following day the late W.L. Wilson learned\nof the unfortunate situation of the two <DW52> people, and he\nimmediately procured a vehicle and took them to a place of safety, and\nalso saw that they were thereafter properly cared for.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the site of the old postoffice on the corner of Wabasha and Fifth\nstreets stood the Mansion house, a three-story frame building erected\nby Nicholas Pottgieser in early days at an expense of $12,000. It was\na very popular resort and for many years the weary traveler there\nreceived a hearty welcome.\n\nA very exciting event occurred at this house during the summer of\n1866. A man by the name of Hawkes, a guest at the hotel, accidentally\nshot and instantly killed his young and beautiful wife. He was\narrested and tried for murder, but after a long and sensational trial\nwas acquited.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe greatest hotel fire in the history of St. Paul occurred on the\nnight of Feb. 3, 1869. The International hotel (formerly the Fuller\nhouse) was situated on the northeast corner of Seventh and Jackson\nstreets, and was erected by A.G. Fuller in 1856. It was built of brick\nand was five stories high. It cost when completed, about $110,000. For\nyears it had been the best hotel in the West. William H. Seward and\nthe distinguished party that accompanied him made this hotel their\nheadquarters during their famous trip to the West in 1860. Gen. Pope\nand Gen. Sibley had their headquarters in this building, and from here\nemanated all the orders relating to the war against the rebellious\nSioux. In 1861 the property came into the possession of Samuel Mayall,\nand he changed the name of it from Fuller house to International\nhotel. Col. E.C. Belote, who had formerly been the landlord of the\nMerchants, was the manager of the hotel. The fire broke out in the\nbasement, it was supposed from a lamp in the laundry. The night was\nintensely cold, a strong gale blowing from the northwest. Not a soul\ncould be seen upon the street. Within this great structure more than\ntwo hundred guests were wrapped in silent slumber. To rescue them from\ntheir perilous position was the problem that required instant action\non the part of the firemen and the hotel authorities. The legislature\nwas then in session, and many of the members were among the guests who\ncrowded the hotel. A porter was the first to notice the blaze, and\nhe threw a pail water upon it, but with the result that it made no\nimpression upon the flames. The fire continued to extend, and the\nsmoke became very dense and spread into the halls, filling them\ncompletely, rendering breathing almost an impossibility. In the\nmeantime the alarm had been given throughout the house, and the\nguests, both male and female, came rushing out of the rooms in their\nnight Clothes. The broad halls of the hotel were soon filled with a\ncrowd of people who hardly knew which way to go in order to find their\nway to the street. The servant girls succeeded in getting out first,\nand made their way to the snow-covered streets without sufficient\nclothing to protect their persons, and most of them were without\nshoes. While the people were escaping from the building the fire was\nmaking furious and rapid progress. From the laundry the smoke issued\ninto every portion of the building. There was no nook or corner that\nthe flames did not penetrate. The interior of the building burned with\ngreat rapidity until the fire had eaten out the eastern and southern\nrooms, when the walls began to give indications of falling. The upper\nportion of them waved back and forth in response to a strong wind,\nwhich filled the night air with cinders. At last different portions of\nthe walls fell, thus giving the flames an opportunity to sweep from\nthe lower portions of the building. Great gusts, which seemed to\nalmost lift the upper floors, swept through the broken walls. High up\nover the building the flames climbed, carrying with them sparks and\ncinders, and in come instances large pieces of timber. All that saved\nthe lower part of the city from fiery destruction was the fact that a\nsolid bed of snow a foot deep lay upon the roofs of all the buildings.\nDuring all this time there was comparative quiet, notwithstanding the\nfact that the fire gradually extended across Jackson street and also\nacross Seventh street. Besides the hotel, six or eight other buildings\nwere also on fire, four of which were destroyed. Women and men were to\nbe seen hurrying out of the burning buildings in their night\nclothes, furniture was thrown into the street, costly pianos, richly\nupholstered furniture, valuable pictures and a great many other\nexpensive articles were dropped in the snow in a helter-skelter\nmanner. Although nearly every room in the hotel was occupied and\nrumors flew thick and fast that many of the guests were still in their\nrooms, fortunately no lives were lost and no one was injured. The\ncoolest person in the building was a young man by the name of Pete\nO'Brien, the night watchman. When he heard of the fire he comprehended\nin a moment the danger of a panic among over two hundred people who\nwere locked in sleep, unconscious of danger. He went from room to room\nand from floor to floor, telling them of the danger, but assuring them\nall that they had plenty of time to escape. He apparently took command\nof the excited guests and issued orders like a general on the field of\nbattle. To his presence of mind and coolness many of the guests were\nindebted for their escape from a frightful death. The fire department\nworked hard and did good service. The city had no waterworks at that\ntime, but relied for water entirely upon cisterns located in different\nparts of the city. When the cisterns became dry it was necessary\nto place the steamer at the river and pump water through over two\nthousand feet of hose.\n\nAmong the guests at the hotel at the time of the fire were Gen. C.C.\nAndrews, Judge Lochren, Capt. H.A. Castle, Gen. W.G. Le Duc, Selah\nChamberlain, Gov. Armstrong and wife, Charles A. Gilman and wife,\nDr. W.W. Mayo, I.W. Webb, Dr. Charles N. Hewitt, M.H. Dunnell, Judge\nThomas Wilson and more than two hundred others.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Park Place hotel on the corner of Summit avenue and St. Peter\nstreet, was at one time one of of the swell hotels of the city. It\nwas a frame building, four stories high and nicely situated. The\nproprietors of it intended it should be a family hotel, but it did not\nmeet with the success anticipated, and when, on the 19th of May, 1878,\nit was burned to the ground it was unoccupied. The fire was thought\nto be the work of incendiaries. The loss was about $20,000, partially\ninsured. Four firemen were quite seriously injured at this fire, but\nall recovered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Carpenter house, on the corner of Summit avenue and Ramsey street,\nwas built by Warren Carpenter. Mr. Carpenter was a man of colossal\nideas, and from the picturesque location of his hotel, overlooking the\ncity, he could see millions of tourists flocking to his hostelry. The\npanic of 1857, soon followed by the great Civil war, put a quietus on\nimmigration, and left him stranded high on the beach. Mr. Carpenter's\ndream of millions were far from being realized, and when on the 26th\nof January, 1879, the hotel was burned to the ground, it had for some\ntime previous passed beyond his control.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt one time there were three flourishing hotels on Bench street.\nThe average citizen of to-day does not know that such a street ever\nexisted. The Central house, on the corner of Bench and Minnesota\nstreets, was the first hotel of any pretension built in the city,\nand it was one of the last to be burned. The first session of the\nterritorial legislature of Minnesota was held in the dining room of\nthis old hotel building, and for a number of years the hotel did a\nthriving business. As the city grew it was made over into a large\nboarding house, and before the war Mrs. Corbett was manager of the\nplace. It was afterward kept by Mrs. Ferguson, George Pulford and Ben\nFerris, the latter being in possession of it when it was destroyed by\nfire. The building was burned In August, 1873.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hotel that was very popular for some time was the Greenman house,\nsituated on the corner of Fifth and St. Peter streets, the site of the\nWindsor hotel. It was a three-story frame structure and was built in\nthe early seventies. Mr. Greenman kept the hotel for some time, and\nthen sold it to John Summers, who was the owner of it when it was\nburned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Merchants is the only one of the old hotels still existing, and\nthat only in name, as the original structure was torn down to make\nroom for the present building many years ago.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAside from the hotel fires one of the most appalling calamities that\never occurred at a fire in St. Paul took place in May, 1870, when the\nold Concert Hall building on Third street, near Market, was destroyed.\nConcert Hall was built by the late J.W. McClung in 1857, and the hall\nin the basement was one of the largest in the city. The building was\nthree stories high in front and six or seven on the river side. It\nwas located about twenty-five feet back from the sidewalk. Under the\nsidewalk all kinds of inflamable material was stored and it was from\nhere that the fire was first noticed. In an incredibly short time\nflames reached the top of the building, thus making escape almost\nimpossible. On the river side of the building on the top floor two\nbrothers, Charles and August Mueller, had a tailor shop. The fire\nspread so rapidly that the building was completely enveloped in flames\nbefore they even thought their lives were endangered. In front of them\nwas a seething mass of flames and the distance to the ground on the\nriver side was so great that a leap from the window meant almost\ncertain death. They could be plainly seen frantically calling for\nhelp. There was no possible way to reach them. Finally Charles Mueller\njumped out on the window sill and made a leap for life, and an instant\nlater he was followed by his brother. The bewildered spectators did\nnot suppose for a moment that either could live. They were too much\nhorrified to speak, but when it was over and they were lifted into\nbeds provided for them doctors were called and recovery was pronounced\npossible. After months of suffering both recovered. August Mueller is\nstill living in the city. A lady by the name of McClellan, who had a\ndressmaking establishment in the building, was burned to death and it\nwas several days before her body was recovered.\n\nThe following named men have been chiefs of the St. Paul fire\ndepartment:\n\n  Wash M. Stees,\n  Chas. H. Williams,\n  J.C.A. Pickett,\n  W.T. Donaldson,\n  J.B. Irvine,\n  J.E. Missen,\n  Luther H. Eddy,\n  B. Rodick,\n  M.B. Farrell,\n  J.C.

PAUL.\n\nINCIDENTS CONNECTED WITH THE EARLY AMUSEMENT HALLS OF ST. PAUL--IRVINE\nHALL--DAN EMMET AND DIXIE--THE HUTCHINSONS--MAZURKA HALL, MOZART HALL,\nETC.\n\n\nVery few of the 200,000 inhabitants of St. Paul are aware that the\nthree-story, three-cornered building on Third street at Seven Corners\nonce contained one of the most popular amusement halls in the city. It\nwas called Irvine hall, and at one time Melodeon hall. Dan Emmet had a\nminstrel company at this hall during the years 1857 and 1858, and an\nexcellent company it was, too. There was Frank Lombard, the great\nbaritone; Max Irwin, bones, and one of the funniest men who ever sat\non the stage; Johnny Ritter, female impersonator and clog dancer, and\na large number of others. Frank Lombard afterward achieved a national\nreputation as one of the best baritone singers in the country. He\nwas much sought after for patriotic entertainments and political\nconventions. His masterpiece was the Star-Spangled Banner, and his\ngreat baritone voice, which could be heard for blocks, always brought\nenthusiastic applause. Some time during the summer of 1858 the\nHutchinson family arranged to have the hall for a one-night\nentertainment. By some means or other the troupe got separated and one\nof the brothers got stalled on Pig's Eye bar. When their performance\nwas about half over the belated brother reached the hall and rushed\nfrantically down the aisle, with carpetbag in hand, leaped upon the\nstage, and in full view of the audience proceeded to kiss the entire\ntribe. The audience was under the impression they had been separated\nfor years instead of only twenty-four hours. The next evening Max\nIrwin was missing from his accustomed place as one of the end men, and\nwhen the performance had been in progress for about fifteen minutes\nMax came rushing down the aisle with carpetbag in hand and went\nthrough the same performance as did the lost brother of the Hutchinson\nfamily. The effect was electrical, and for some time Max's innovation\nwas the talk of the town. Dan Emmet, though a wondering minstrel, was\na very superior man and was his own worst enemy. He was a brother of\nLafayette S. Emmett, chief justice of the supreme court of the State\nof Minnesota. The judge, dignified and aristocratic, did not take\nkindly to the idea of his brother being a minstrel. Dan was not\nparticularly elated because his brother was on the supreme bench. They\nwere wholly indifferent as to each other's welfare. They did not even\nspell their names the same way. Dan had only one \"t\" at the end of his\nname, while the judge used two. Whether the judge used two because\nhe was ashamed of Dan, or whether Dan used only one because he was\nashamed of the judge, no one seemed to know. Dan Emmet left a legacy\nthat will be remembered by the lovers of melody for many years. What\nleft the judge? When Emmet's company left St. Paul they got stranded\nand many of them found engagements in other organizations. Dan turned\nhis attention to writing <DW64> melodies. He wrote several popular\nairs, one of them being \"Dixie,\" which afterward became the national\nair of the Confederate States. When \"Dixie\" was written Emmet was\nconnected with Bryant's Minstrels in New York city, and he sent a copy\nto his friend in St. Paul, the late R.C. Munger, and asked his opinion\nas to its merits and whether he thought it advisable to place it\nin the hands of a publisher. Mr. Munger assured his friend that he\nthought it would make a great hit, and he financially assisted Mr.\nEmmet in placing it before the public. One of the first copies printed\nwas sent to Mr. Munger, and the first time this celebrated composition\nwas ever sung in the West was in the music store of Munger Bros, in\nthe old concert hall building on Third street. \"Dixie\" at once became\nvery popular, and was soon on the program of every minstrel troupe in\nthe country. Dan Emmet devoted his whole life to minstrelsy and he\norganized the first traveling minstrel troupe in the United States,\nstarting from some point in Ohio in 1843.\n\nThe father of the Emmets was a gallant soldier of the War of 1812, and\nat one time lived in the old brown frame house at the intersection of\nRamsey and West Seventh streets, recently demolished. A correspondent\nof one of the magazines gives the following account of how \"Dixie\"\nhappened to become the national air of the Confederate States:\n\n\"Early in the war a spectacular performance was being given in New\nOrleans. Every part had been filled, and all that was lacking was a\nmarch and war song for the grand chorus. A great many marches and\nsongs were tried, but none could be decided upon until 'Dixie' was\nsuggested and tried, and all were so enthusiastic over it that it\nwas at once adopted and given in the performance. It was taken up\nimmediately by the populace and was sung in the streets and in homes\nand concert halls daily. It was taken to the battlefields, and there\nbecame the great song of the South, and made many battles harder\nfor the Northerner, many easier for the Southerner. Though it has\nparticularly endeared itself to the South, the reunion of American\nhearts has made it a national song. Mr. Lincoln ever regarded it as a\nnational property by capture.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Hutchinson family often visited St. Paul, the enterprising town of\nHutchinson, McLeod county, being named after them. They were a very\npatriotic family and generally sang their own music. How deliberate\nthe leader of the tribe would announce the title of the song about to\nbe produced. Asa Hutchinson would stand up behind the melodeon,\nand with a pause between each word inform the audience that\n\"Sister--Abby--will--now--sing--the--beautiful--song--composed--\nby--Lucy--Larcum--entitled--'Hannah--Is--at--the--Window--Binding--\nShoes.'\" And sister Abby would sing it, too. During the early\npart of the war the Hutchinson family was ordered out of the Army of\nthe Potomac by Gen. McClellan on account of the abolition sentiments\nexpressed in its songs. The general was apparently unable to interpret\nthe handwriting on the wall, as long before the war was ended the\nentire army was enthusiastically chanting that beautiful melody to the\nking of abolitionists--\n\n  \"John Brown's body lies moldering in the grave\n  And his soul is marching on.\"\n\nGen. McClellan was at one time the idol of the army, as well as of the\nentire American people. Before the war he was chief engineer of the\nIllinois Central railroad and made frequent trips to St. Paul to see\nthe future Mrs. McClellan, a Miss Marcy, daughter of Maj. R.B. Marcy\nof the regular army, who lived in the old Henry M. Rice homestead on\nSummit avenue. When Gen. McClellan was in command of the Army of the\nPotomac Maj. Marcy was his chief of staff.\n\nOne of the original Hutchinsons is still living, as indicated by the\nfollowing dispatch, published since the above was written:\n\n\"Chicago, Ill., Jan. 4, 1902.--John W. Hutchinson, the last survivor\nof the famous old concert-giving Hutchinson family, which\nwas especially prominent in anti-bellum times, received many\ncongratulations to-day on the occasion of his eighty-first birthday,\nMr. Hutchinson enjoys good health and is about to start on a new\nsinging and speaking crusade through the South, this time against the\nsale and us of cigarettes. Mr. Hutchinson made a few remarks to the\nfriends who had called upon him, in the course of which he said: 'I\nnever spent a more enjoyable birthday than this, except upon the\noccasion of my seventy-fifth, which I spent in New York and was\ntendered a reception by the American Temperance union, of which I was\nthe organizer. Of course you will want me to sing to you, and I\nthink I will sing my favorite song, which I wrote myself. It is \"The\nFatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man.\" I have written a great\nmany songs, among them \"The Blue and the Gray,\" \"Good old Days of\nYore,\" and some others that I cannot remember now. I sang the \"Blue\nand the Gray\" in Atlanta six years ago, at the time of the exposition\nthere, and McKinley was there. I had the pleasure of saying a few\nwords at that time about woman's suffrage. I wrote the first song\nabout woman's suffrage and called it \"Good Times for Women.\" This is\nthe 11,667th concert which I have taken part in.'\"\n\nThe venerable singer is reputed to be quite wealthy. A few years ago\none of the children thought the old man was becoming entirely too\nliberal in the distribution of his wealth, and brought an action in\nthe New York courts requesting the appointment of a guardian to\nhis estate. The white-haired musician appeared in court without an\nattorney, and when the case was about to be disposed of made a request\nof the judge, which was granted, that he might be sworn. After Mr.\nHutchinson had made his statement to the court the judge asked a few\nquestions. \"How is your memory?\" said the judge. \"Memory,\" replied the\nold man. \"I remember the flavor of the milk at the maternal fountain.\"\nThe judge concluded that Mr. Hutchinson was fully capable of managing\nhis own affairs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nConcert hall, built in 1857 by J.W. McClung, had room for 400 or 500\npeople, but it was somewhat inaccessible on account of its being in\nthe basement of the building and was not very much in demand. Horatio\nSeymour made a great speech to the Douglas wing of the Democracy in\nthe hall during the campaign of 1880, and Tom Marshall, the great\nKentucky orator, delivered a lecture on Napoleon to a large audience\nIn the same place. On the night of the presidential election in 1860 a\nnumber of musicians who had been practicing on \"Dixie\" and other music\nin Munger's music store came down to the hall and entertained the\nRepublicans who had gathered there for the purpose of hearing the\nelection returns. There was a great deal more singing than there was\nelection returns, as about all the news they were able to get was from\nthe four precincts of St. Paul, New Canada, Rose and Reserve townships\nand West St. Paul. We had a telegraph line, to be sure, but Mr.\nWinslow, who owned the line, would not permit the newspapers, or any\none else, to obtain the faintest hint of how the election had gone in\nother localities. After singing until 11 or 12 o'clock, and abusing\nMr. Winslow in language that the linotype is wholly unable to\nreproduce, the crowd dispersed. Nothing could be heard of how the\nelection had gone until the following afternoon, when Gov. Ramsey\nreceived a dispatch from New York announcing that that state had\ngiven Mr. Lincoln 50,000 majority. As that was the pivotal state the\nRepublicans immediately held a jollification meeting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom Marshall was one of the most eloquent orators America ever\nproduced. He was spending the summer in Minnesota endeavoring to\nrecover from the effects of an over-indulgence of Kentucky's great\nstaple product, but the glorious climate of Minnesota did not seem to\nhave the desired effect, as he seldom appeared on the street without\npresenting the appearance of having discovered in the North Star State\nan elixer fully as invigorating as any produced in the land where\ncolonels, orators and moonshiners comprise the major portion of the\npopulation. One day as Marshall came sauntering down Third street he\nmet a club of Little Giants marching to a Democratic gathering.\nThey thought they would have a little sport at the expense of the\ndistinguished orator from Kentucky, and they haulted immediately in\nfront of him and demanded a speech. They knew that Mr. Marshall was a\npronounced Whig and supported the candidacy of Bell and Everett, but\nas he was from a slave state they did not think he would say anything\nreflecting on the character of their cherished leader. Mr. Marshall\nstepped to the front of the sidewalk and held up his hand and said:\n\"Do you think Douglas will ever be president? He will not, as no man\nof his peculiar physique ever entered the sacred portals of the White\nHouse.\" He then proceeded to denounce Douglas and the Democratic party\nin language that was very edifying to the few Republicans who chanced\nto be present. The Little Giants concluded that it was not the proper\ncaper to select a casual passer-by for speaker, and were afterward\nmore particular in their choice of an orator.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne night there was a Democratic meeting in the hall and after a\nnumber of speakers had been called upon for an address, De Witt C.\nCooley, who was a great wag, went around in the back part of the hall\nand called upon the unterrified to \"Holler for Cooley.\" The request\nwas complied with and Mr. Cooley's name was soon on the lips of nearly\nthe whole audience. When Mr. Cooley mounted the platform an Irishman\nin the back part of the hall inquired in a voice loud enough to be\nheard by the entire audience, \"Is that Cooley?\" Upon being assured\nthat it was, he replied in a still louder voice: \"Be jabers, that's\nthe man that told me to holler for Cooley.\" The laugh was decidedly on\nCooley, and his attempted flight of oratory did not materialize.\n\nCooley was at one time governor of the third house and if his message\nto that body could be reproduced it would make very interesting\nreading.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Athenaeum was constructed in 1859 by the German Reading society,\nand for a number of years was the only amusement hall in St. Paul with\na stage and drop curtain. In 1861 Peter and Caroline Richings spent\na part of the summer in St. Paul, and local amusement lovers were\ndelightfully entertained by these celebrities during their sojourn.\nDuring the war a number of dramatic and musical performances were\ngiven at the Athenaeum for the boys in blue. The cantata of \"The\nHaymakers,\" for the benefit of the sanitary commission made quite a\nhit, and old residents will recollect Mrs. Winne, Mrs. Blakeley and\nProf. Perkins, who took the leading parts. Prof. Phil Roher and Otto\nDreher gave dramatic performances both in German and English for some\ntime after the close of the war. Plunkett's Dramatic company, with\nSusan Denin as the star, filled the boards at this hall a short time\nbefore the little old opera house was constructed on Wabasha street.\nDuring the Sioux massacre a large number of maimed refugees were\nbrought to the city and found temporary shelter in this place.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn 1853 Market hall, on the corner of Wabasha and Seventh streets, was\nbuilt, and it was one of the principal places of amusement. The Hough\nDramatic company, with Bernard, C.W. Couldock, Sallie St. Clair and\nothers were among the notable performers who entertained theatergoers.\nIn 1860 the Wide Awakes used this place for a drill hall, and so\nproficient did the members become that many of them were enabled to\ntake charge of squads, companies and even regiments in the great\nstruggle that was soon to follow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn 1860 the Ingersoll block on Bridge Square was constructed, and as\nthat was near the center of the city the hall on the third floor\nwas liberally patronized for a number of years. Many distinguished\nspeakers have entertained large and enthusiastic audiences from the\nplatform of this popular hall. Edward Everett, Ralph Waldo Emerson and\nJohn B. Gough are among the great orators who have electrified and\ninstructed the older inhabitants, and the musical notes of the Black\nSwan, Mlle. Whiting and Madame Varian will ever be remembered by\nthose whose pleasure it was to listen to them. Mrs. Scott Siddons, an\nelocutionist of great ability and a descendant of the famous English\nfamily of actors of that name, gave several dramatic readings to her\nnumerous admirers. When Sumter was fired on, Capt. W.H. Acker used\nthis hall as a rendezvous and drill hall for Company C, First regiment\nof Minnesota volunteers, and many rousing war meetings for the purpose\nof devising ways and means for the furtherance of enlistments took\nplace in this building.\n\nIn February, 1861, the ladies of the different Protestant churches of\nSt. Paul, with the aid of the Young Men's Christian association, gave\na social and supper in this building for the purpose of raising funds\nfor the establishment of a library. It was a sort of dedicatory\nopening of the building and hall, and was attended by large\ndelegations from the different churches. Quite a large sum was\nrealized. A room was fitted up on the second story and the beginning\nof what is now the St. Paul library soon opened up to the public.\nAbout 350 books were purchased with the funds raised by the social,\nand the patrons of the library were required to pay one dollar per\nyear for permission to read them. Dr. T.D. Simonton was the first\nlibrarian. Subsequently this library was consolidated with the St.\nPaul Mercantile Library association and the number of books more than\ndoubled. A regular librarian was then installed with the privilege of\nreading the library's books raised to two dollars per annum.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe People's theater, an old frame building on the corner of Fourth\nand St. Peter streets, was the only real theatrical building in\nthe city. H. Van Liew was the lessee and manager of this place of\nentertainment, and he was provided with a very good stock company.\nEmily Dow and her brother, Harry Gossan and Azelene Allen were among\nthe members. During the summer of 1858 Mr. and Mrs. J.W. Wallack came\nto St. Paul and played a two weeks' engagement. They were the most\nprominent actors who had yet appeared in this part of the country.\n\n\"The Man in the Iron Mask\" and \"Macbeth\" were on their repertoire.\nProbably \"Macbeth\" was never played to better advantage or to more\nappreciative audiences than it was during the stay of the Wallacks.\nMrs. Wallack's Lady Macbeth was a piece of acting that few of the\npresent generation can equal. Col. R.E.J. Miles was one of the stars\nat this theater, and it was at this place that he first produced the\nplay of \"Mazeppa,\" which afterward made him famous. A.M. Carver,\nforeman of the job department of the St. Paul Times, often assisted in\ntheatrical productions. Mr. Carver was not only a first-class printer,\nbut he was also a very clever actor. His portrayal of the character of\nUncle Tom in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" which had quite a run, and was fully\nequal to any later production by full fledged members of the dramatic\nprofession. Mr. Carver was one of the first presidents of the\nInternational Typographical union, and died in Cincinnati many years\nago, leaving a memory that will ever be cherished by all members of\nthe art preservative.\n\nThis theater had a  gallery, and the shaded gentry were\nrequired to pay as much for admission to the gallery at the far end of\nthe building as did the nabobs in the parquet. Joe Rolette, the member\nfrom \"Pembina\" county, occasionally entertained the audience at this\ntheater by having epileptic fits, but Joe's friends always promptly\nremoved him from the building and the performance would go on\nundisturbed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the second story of an old frame building on the southeast corner\nof Third and Exchange streets there was a hall that was at one time\nthe principal amusement hall of the city. The building was constructed\nin 1850 by the Elfelt brothers and the ground floor was occupied by\nthem as a dry goods store. It is one of the very oldest buildings in\nthe city. The name of Elfelt brothers until quite recently could be\nseen on the Exchange street side of the building. The hall was named\nMazurka hall, and all of the swell entertainments of the early '50s\ntook place in this old building. At a ball given in the hall during\none of the winter months more than forty years ago, J.Q.A. Ward,\nbookkeeper for the Minnesotian, met a Miss Pratt, who was a daughter\nof one of the proprietors of the same paper, and after an acquaintance\nof about twenty minutes mysteriously disappeared from the hall and got\nmarried. They intended to keep it a secret for a while, but it was\nknown all over the town the next day and produced great commotion.\nMiss Pratt's parents would not permit her to see her husband, and they\nwere finally divorced without having lived together.\n\nFor a number of years Napoleon Heitz kept a saloon and restaurant in\nthis building. Heitz had participated in a number of battles under\nthe great Napoleon, and the patrons of his place well recollect the\ngraphic descriptions of the battle of Waterloo which he would often\nrelate while the guest was partaking of a Tom and Jerry or an oyster\nstew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the summer of 1860 Charles N. Mackubin erected two large\nbuildings on the site of the Metropolitan hotel. Mozart hall was on\nthe Third street end and Masonic hall on the Fourth street corner. At\na sanitary fair held during the winter of 1864 both of these halls\nwere thrown together and an entertainment on a large scale was\nheld for the benefit of the almost depleted fundes of the sanitary\ncommission. Fairs had been given for this fund in nearly all the\nprincipal cities of the North, and it was customary to vote a sword\nto the most popular volunteer officer whom the state had sent to the\nfront. A large amount of money had been raised in the different cities\non this plan, and the name of Col. Marshall of the Seventh regiment\nand Col. Uline of the Second were selected as two officers in whom it\nwas thought the people would take sufficient interest to bring out a\nlarge vote. The friends of both candidates were numerous and each side\nhad some one stationed at the voting booth keeping tab on the number\nof votes cast and the probable number it would require at the close\nto carry off the prize. Col. Uline had been a fireman and was very\npopular with the young men of the city. Col. Marshall was backed by\nfriends in the different newspaper offices. The contest was very\nspirited and resulted in Col. Uline capturing the sword, he having\nreceived more than two thousand votes in one bundle during the last\nfive minutes the polls were open. This fair was very successful,\nthe patriotic citizens of St. Paul having enriched the funds of the\nsanitary commission by several thousand dollars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the first free concert halls in the city was located on Bridge\nSquare, and it bore the agonizing name of Agony hall. Whether it\nwas named for its agonizing music or the agonizing effects of its\nbeverages was a question that its patrons were not able to determine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn anti-bellum times Washington's birthday was celebrated with more\npomp and glory than any holiday during the year. The Pioneer Guards,\nthe City Guards, the St. Paul Light Artillery, the St. Paul fire\ndepartment and numerous secret organizations would form in\nprocession and march to the capitol, and in the hall of the house of\nrepresentatives elaborate exercises commemorative of the birth of the\nnation's first great hero would take place. Business was generally\nsuspended and none of the daily papers would be issued on the\nfollowing day.\n\nIn 1857 Adalina Patti appeared in St. Paul for the first time. She was\nabout sixteen years old and was with the Ole Bull Concert company.\nThey traveled on a small steamboat and gave concerts in the river\ntowns. Their concert took place in the hall of the house of\nrepresentatives of the old capitol, that being the only available\nplace at the time. Patti's concert came near being nipped in the bud\nby an incident that has never been printed. Two boys employed as\nmessengers at the capitol, both of whom are now prominent business\nmen in the city, procured a key to the house, and, in company with a\nnumber of other kids, proceeded to representative hall, where they\nwere frequently in the habit of congregating for the purpose of\nplaying cards, smoking cigars, and committing such other depradations\nas it was possible for kids to conceive. After an hour or so of\nrevelry the boys returned the key to its proper place and separated.\nIn a few minutes smoke was seen issuing from the windows of the hall\nand an alarm of fire was sounded. The door leading to the house was\nforced open and it was discovered that the fire had nearly burned\nthrough the floor. The boys knew at once that it was their\ncarelessness that had caused the alarm, and two more frightened kids\nnever got together. They could see visions of policemen, prison bars,\nand even Stillwater, day and night for many years. They would often\nget together on a back street and in whispered tones wonder if they\nhad yet been suspected. For more than a quarter of a century these two\nkids kept this secret in the innermost recesses of their hearts,\nand it is only recently that they dared to reveal their terrible\npredicament.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few days after Maj. Anderson was compelled to lower the Stars and\nStripes on Sumter's walls a mass meeting of citizens, irrespective of\nparty, was called to meet at the hall of the house of representatives\nfor the purpose of expressing the indignation of the community at the\ndastardly attempt of the Cotton States to disrupt the government.\nLong before the time for the commencement of the meeting the hall was\npacked and it was found necessary to adjourn to the front steps of\nthe building in order that all who desired might take part in the\nproceedings. Hon. John S. Prince, mayor of the city, presided,\nassisted by half a dozen prominent citizens as vice presidents. Hon.\nJohn M. Gilman, an honored resident of the city, was one of the\nprincipal speakers. Mr. Gilman had been the Democratic candidate for\ncongress the fall previous, and considerable interest was manifested\nto hear what position he would take regarding the impending conflict.\nIt was very soon apparent that Mr. Gilman was in hearty sympathy with\nthe object of the meeting and his remarks were received with great\ndemonstrations of approbation. Hon. J.W. Taylor followed Mr. Gilman\nand made a strong speech in favor of sustaining Mr. Lincoln. There\nwere a number of other addresses, after which resolutions were adopted\npledging the government the earnest support of the citizens, calling\non the young men to enroll their names on the roster of the rapidly\nforming companies and declaring that they would furnish financial aid\nwhen necessary to the dependant families of those left behind. Similar\nmeetings were held in different parts of the city a great many times\nbefore the Rebellion was subdued.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first Republican state convention after the state was admitted\ninto the Union was held in the hall of the house of representatives.\nThe state was not divided into congressional districts at that time\nand Col. Aldrich and William Windom were named as the candidates for\nrepresentatives in congress. Col. Aldrich did not pretend to be much\nof an orator, and in his speech of acceptance he stated that while\nhe was not endowed with as much oratorical ability as some of his\nassociates on the ticket, yet he could work as hard as any one, and\nhe promised that he would sweat at least a barrel in his efforts to\npromote the success of the ticket.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAromory hall, on Third street, between Cedar and Minnesota, was built\nin 1859, and was used by the Pioneer Guards up to the breaking out of\nthe war. The annual ball of the Pioneer Guards was the swell affair of\nthe social whirl, and it was anticipated with as much interest by\nthe Four Hundred as the charity ball is to-day. The Pioneer Guards\ndisbanded shortly after the war broke out, and many of its members\nwere officers in the Union army, although two or three of them stole\naway and joined the Confederate forces, one of them serving on Lee's\nstaff during the entire war. Col. Wilkin Col. King, Col. Farrell,\nCapt. Coates, Capt. Van Slyke, Capt. Western, Lieut. Zernberg and\nLieut. Tuttle were early in the fray, while a number of others\nfollowed as the war progressed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not until the winter of 1866-67 that St. Paul could boast of a\ngenuine opera house. The old opera house fronting on Wabasha street,\non the ground that is now occupied by the Grand block, was finished\nthat winter and opened with a grand entertainment given by local\ntalent. The boxes and a number of seats in the parquet were sold at\nauction, the highest bidder being a man by the name of Philbrick, who\npaid $72 for a seat in the parquet. This man Philbrick was a visitor\nin St. Paul, and had a retinue of seven or eight people with him. It\nwas whispered around that he was some kind of a royal personage, and\nwhen he paid $72 for a seat at the opening of the opera house people\nwere sure that he was at least a duke. He disappeared as mysteriously\nas he had appeared. It was learned afterward that this mysterious\nperson was Coal Oil Johnny out on a lark. The first regular company to\noccupy this theater was the Macfarland Dramatic company, with Emily\nMelville as the chief attraction. This little theater could seat about\n1,000 people, and its seating capacity was taxed many a time long\nbefore the Grand opera house in the rear was constructed. Wendell\nPhilips, Henry Ward Beecher, Theodore Tilton, Frederick Douglass and\nmany others have addressed large audiences from the stage of this old\nopera house. An amusing incident occurred while Frederick Douglass was\nin St. Paul. Nearly every seat in the house had been sold long before\nthe lecture was to commence, and when Mr. Douglass commenced speaking\nthere was standing room only. A couple of enthusiastic Republicans\nfound standing room in one of the small upper boxes, and directly in\nfront of them was a well-known Democratic politician by the name of\nW.H. Shelley. Mr. Shelley had at one time been quite prominent in\nlocal Republican circles, but when Andrew Johnson made his famous\nswing around the circle Shelley got an idea that the proper thing to\ndo was to swing around with him. Consequently the Republicans who\nstood up behind Mr. Shelley thought they would have a little amusement\nat his expense. Every time Mr. Douglass made a point worthy\nof applause these ungenerous Republicans would make a great\ndemonstration, and as the audience could not see them and could\nonly see the huge outline of Mr. Shelley they concluded that he was\nthoroughly enjoying the lecture and had probably come back to the\nRepublican fold. Mr. Shelley stood it until the lecture was about\nhalf over, when he left the opera house in disgust. Mr. Shelley was a\ncandidate for the position of collector of customs of the port of St.\nPaul and his name had been sent to the senate by President Johnson,\nbut as that body was largely Republican his nomination lacked\nconfirmation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout the time of the great Heenan and Sayers prize fight in England\na number of local sports arranged to have a mock engagement at the\nAthenaeum. There was no kneitoscopic method of reproducing a fight at\nthat time, but it was planned to imitate the great fight as closely as\npossible. James J. Hill was to imitate Sayers and Theodore Borup the\nBenecia boy. They were provided with seconds, surgeons and all\nthe attendants necessary for properly staging the melee. It was\nprearranged that Theodore, in the sixth or seventh round, was to knock\nHill out, but as the battle progressed, Theodore made a false pass and\nHill could not desist from taking advantage of it, and the prearranged\nplan was reversed by Hill knocking Theodore out. And Hill has kept\nright on taking advantage of the false movements of his adversaries,\nand is now knocking them out with more adroitness than he did forty\nyears ago.\n\n\n\n\nPRINTERS AND EDITORS OF TERRITORIAL DAYS.\n\nCAPT.E.Y.

SHELLY.\n\nMuch has been written of the trials and tribulations of the pioneer\neditors of Minnesota and what they have accomplished in bringing to\nthe attention of the outside world the numerous advantages possessed\nby this state as a place of permanent location for all classes of\npeople, but seldom, if ever, has the nomadic printer, \"the man behind\nthe gun,\" received even partial recognition from the chroniclers of\nour early history. In the spring of 1849 James M. Goodhue arrived in\nSt. Paul from Lancaster, Wis., with a Washington hand press and a few\nfonts of type, and he prepared to start a paper at the capital of the\nnew territory of Minnesota. Accompanying him were two young printers,\nnamed Ditmarth and Dempsey, they being the first printers to set foot\non the site of what was soon destined to be the metropolis of the\ngreat Northwest. These two young men quickly tired of their isolation\nand returned to their former home. They were soon followed by another\nyoung man, who had only recently returned from the sunny plains\nof far-off Mexico, where he had been heroically battling for his\ncountry's honor. Capt. E.Y. Shelly was born in Bucks county, Pa.,\non the 25th of September, 1827. When a mere lad he removed to\nPhiladelphia, where he was instructed in the art preservative, and, on\nthe breaking out of the Mexican war, he laid aside the stick and rule\nand placed his name on the roster of a company that was forming to\ntake part in the campaign against the Mexicans. He was assigned to\nthe Third United States dragoons and started at once for the scene of\nhostilities. On arriving at New Orleans the Third dragoons was ordered\nto report to Gen. Taylor, who was then in the vicinity of Matamoras.\nAs soon as Gen. Taylor was in readiness he drove the Mexicans across\nthe Rio Grande, and the battles of Palo Alto, Monterey and Buena Vista\nfollowed in quick succession, in all of which the American forces\nwere successful against an overwhelming force of Mexicans, the Third\ndragoons being in all the engagements, and they received special\nmention for their conspicuous gallantry in defending their position\nagainst the terrible onslaught of the Mexican forces under the\nleadership of Santa Ana. Soon after the battle of Buena Vista, Santa\nAna withdrew from Gen. Taylor's front and retreated toward the City\nof Mexico, in order to assist in the defense of that city against the\nAmerican forces under the command of Gen. Scott. Peace was declared in\n1848 and the Third dragoons were ordered to Jefferson barracks, St.\nLouis, where they were mustered out of the service. Capt. Shelly took\npassage in a steamer for St. Paul, where he arrived in July, 1849,\nbeing the first printer to permanently locate in Minnesota. The\nPioneer was the first paper printed in St. Paul, but the Register and\nChronicle soon followed. Capt. Shelly's first engagement was in the\noffice of the Register, but he soon changed to the Pioneer, and was\nemployed by Mr. Goodhue at the time of his tragic death. When Col.\nRobertson Started the Daily Democrat Capt. Shelly was connected\nwith that office, and remained there until the Pioneer and Democrat\nconsolidated. Capt. Shelly was a member of the old Pioneer guards, and\nwhen President Lincoln called for men to suppress the rebellion the\nold patriotism was aroused in him, and he organized, in company with\nMajor Brackett, a company for what was afterward known as Brackett's\nbattalion.\n\nBrackett's battalion consisted of three Minnesota companies, and they\nwere mustered into service in September, 1861. They were ordered to\nreport at Benton barracks, Mo., and were assigned to a regiment known\nas Curtis horse, but afterward changed to Fifth Iowa cavalry. In\nFebruary, 1862, the regiment was ordered to Fort Henry, Tenn., and\narrived just in time to take an important part in the attack and\nsurrender of Fort Donelson. Brackett's battalion was the only\nMinnesota force engaged at Fort Donelson, and, although they were\nnot in the thickest of the fight, yet they performed tremendous and\nexhaustive service in preventing the rebel Gen. Buckner from receiving\nreinforcements. After the surrender the regiment was kept on continual\nscout duty, as the country was overrun with bands of guerrillas and\nthe inhabitants nearly all sympathized with them. From Fort Donelson\nthree companies of the regiment went to Savannah, (one of them being\nCapt. Shelly's) where preparations were being made to meet Gen.\nBeauregard, who was only a short distance away. Brackett's company was\nsent out in the direction of Louisville with orders to see that the\nroads and bridges were not molested, so that the forces under Gen.\nBuell would not be obstructed on the march to reinforce Gen. Grant.\nThis timely precaution enabled Gen. Buell to arrive at Pittsburg\nLanding just in time to save Gen. Grant from probable defeat. For\nthree months after this battle Capt. Shelly's company was engaged in\nprotecting the long line of railroad from Columbus, Ky., to Corinth,\nMiss. On the 25th of August, 1862, Fort Donalson was attacked by the\nrebels and this regiment was ordered to its relief. This attack of the\nrebels did not prove to be very serious, but on the 5th of February,\n1863, the rebels under Forrest and Wheeler made a third attack on Fort\nDonelson. They were forced to retire, leaving a large number of their\ndead on the field, but fortunately none of the men under Capt. Shelly\nwere injured. Nearly the entire spring and summer of 1863 was spent in\nscouring the country in the vicinity of the Tennessee river, sometimes\non guard duty, sometimes on the picket line and often in battle. They\nwere frequently days and nights without food or sleep, but ever kept\nthemselves in readiness for an attack from the wily foes. Opposed to\nthem were the commands of Forest and Wheeler, the very best cavalry\nofficers in the Confederate service. A number of severe actions ended\nin the battle of Chickamauga, in which the First cavalry took a\nprominent part. After the battle of Chickamauga the regiment was kept\non duty on the dividing line between the two forces. About the 1st\nof January, 1864, most of Capt. Shelly's company reinlisted and they\nreturned home on a thirty days' furlough. After receiving a number\nof recruits at Fort Snelling, the command, on the 14th of May, 1864,\nreceived orders to report to Gen. Sully at Sioux City, who was\npreparing to make a final campaign against the rebellious Sioux. On\nthe 28th of June the expedition started on its long and weary march\nover the plains of the Dakotas toward Montana. It encountered the\nIndians a number of times, routing them, and continued on its way.\nAbout the middle of August the expedition entered the Bad Lands, and\nthe members were the first white men to traverse that unexplored\nregion. In the fall the battalion returned to Fort Ridgley, where\nthey went into winter quarters, having marched over 3,000 miles since\nleaving Fort Snelling. Capt. Shelly was mustered out of the service in\nthe spring of 1865, and since that time, until within a few years, has\nbeen engaged at his old profession.\n\nCapt. Shelly was almost painfully modest, seldom alluding to the many\nstirring events with which he had been an active participant, and it\ncould well be said of him, as Cardinal Wolsey said of himself, that\n\"had he served his God with half the zeal he has served his country,\nhe would not in his old age have forsaken him.\" Political preferment\nand self-assurance keep some men constantly before the public eye,\nwhile others, the men of real merit, who have spent the best part of\ntheir lives in the service of their country, are often permitted by an\nungrateful community to go down to their graves unhonored and unsung.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOTHER PRINTERS IN THE CIVIL WAR.\n\nCapt. Henry C. Coates was foreman of the job department of the Pioneer\noffice. He was an officer in the Pioneer Guards, and when the war\nbroke out was made a lieutenant in the First regiment, was in all the\nbattles of that famous organization up to and including Gettysburg;\nwas commander of the regiment for some time after the battle. After\nthe war he settled in Philadelphia, where he now resides.\n\nJacob J. Noah at one time set type, with Robert Bonner. He was elected\nclerk of the supreme court at the first election of state officers;\nwas captain of Company K Second Minnesota regiment, but resigned early\nin the war and moved to New York City, his former home.\n\nFrank H. Pratt was an officer in the Seventh regiment and served\nthrough the war. He published a paper at Taylor's Falls at one time.\nAfter the war he was engaged in the mercantile business in St. Paul.\n\nJohn C. Devereux was foreman of the old Pioneer and was an officer in\nthe Third regiment, and still resides in the city.\n\nJacob T. McCoy was an old-time typo and worked in all the St. Paul\noffices before and after the rebellion. Mr. McCoy was a fine singer\nand his voice was always heard at typographical gatherings. He\nenlisted as private in the Second Minnesota and served more than four\nyears, returning as first lieutenant. He now resides in Meadeville,\nPa.\n\nMartin Williams was printer, editor, reporter and publisher, both\nbefore and after the war. He was quartermaster of the Second Minnesota\ncavalry.\n\nRobert P. Slaughter and his brother, Thomas Slaughter, were both\nofficers in the volunteer service and just previous to the rebellion\nwere engaged in the real estate business.\n\nEdward Richards was foreman of the Pioneer and Minnesotian before the\nwar and foreman of the old St. Paul Press after the war. He enlisted\nduring the darkest days of the rebellion in the Eighth regiment and\nserved in the dual capacity of correspondent and soldier. No better\nsoldier ever left the state. He was collector of customs of the port\nof St. Paul under the administration of Presidents Garfield and\nArthur, and later was on the editorial staff of the Pioneer Press.\n\nThe most remarkable compositor ever in the Northwest, if not in the\nUnited States, was the late Charles R. Stuart. He claimed to be a\nlineal descendant of the royal house of Stuart. For two years in\nsuccession he won the silver cup in New York city for setting more\ntype than any of his competitors. At an endurance test in New York he\nis reported to have set and distributed 26,000 ems solid brevier in\ntwenty-four hours. He was originally from Detroit. In the spring of\n1858 he wandered into the Minnesotian office and applied for work. The\nMinnesotian was city printer and was very much in need of some one\nthat day to help them out. Mr. Stuart was put to work and soon\ndistributed two cases of type, and the other comps wondered what he\nwas going to do with it. After he had been at work a short time\nthey discovered that he would be able to set up all the type he had\ndistributed and probably more, too. When he pasted up the next morning\nthe foreman measured his string and remeasured it, and then went over\nand took a survey of Mr. Stuart, and then went back and measured it\nagain. He then called up the comps, and they looked it over, but no\none could discover anything wrong with it. The string measured 23,000\nems, and was the most remarkable feat of composition ever heard of in\nthis section of the country. It was no uncommon occurrence for Mr.\nStuart to set 2,000 ems of solid bourgeois an hour, and keep it up for\nthe entire day. Mr. Stuart's reputation as a rapid compositor spread\nall over the city in a short time and people used to come to the\noffice to see him set type, with as much curiosity as they do now to\nsee the typesetting machine. In 1862 Mr. Stuart enlisted in the Eighth\nregiment and served for three years, returning home a lieutenant. For\na number of years he published a paper at Sault Ste Marie, in which\nplace he died about five years ago. He was not only a good printer,\nbut a very forceful writer, in fact he was an expert in everything\nconnected with the printing business.\n\nE.S. Lightbourn was one of the old-time printers. He served three\nyears in the Seventh Minnesota and after the war was foreman of the\nPioneer.\n\nM.J. Clum is one of the oldest printers in St. Paul. He was born in\nRensselar county, New York, in 1832, and came to St. Paul in 1853.\nHe learned his trade in Troy, and worked with John M. Francis, late\nminister to Greece, and also with C.L. McArthur, editor of the\nNorthern Budget. Mr. Clum was a member of Company D, Second Minnesota,\nand took part in several battles in the early part of the rebellion.\n\nJ.B. Chancy came to Minnesota before the state was admitted to the\nUnion. At one time he was foreman of a daily paper at St. Anthony\nFalls. During the war he was a member of Berdan's sharpshooters, who\nwere attached to the First regiment.\n\nS J. Albright worked on the Pioneer in territorial days. In 1859 he\nwent to Yankton, Dak., and started the first paper in that territory.\nHe was an officer in a Michigan regiment during the rebellion. For\nmany years was a publisher of a paper in Michigan, and under the last\nadministration of Grover Cleveland was governor of Alaska.\n\nM.R. Prendergast, though not connected with the printing business\nfor some time, yet he is an old time printer, and was in the Tenth\nMinnesota during the rebellion.\n\nA.J. Underwood was a member of Berdan's Sharp-shooters, and was\nconnected with a paper at Fergus Falls for a number of years.\n\nRobert V. Hesselgrave was employed in nearly all the St. Paul offices\nat various times. He was lieutenant in the First Minnesota Heavy\nArtillery, and is now engaged in farming in the Minnesota valley.\n\nWilliam A. Hill came to St. Paul during the early '50s. He was a\nmember of the Seventh Minnesota.\n\nOle Johnson was a member of the First Minnesota regiment, and died in\na hospital in Virginia.\n\nWilliam F. Russel, a compositor on the Pioneer, organized a company of\nsharpshooters in St. Paul, and they served throughout the war in the\narmy of the Potomac.\n\nS. Teverbaugh and H.I. Vance were territorial printers, and were both\nin the army, but served in regiments outside the state.\n\nThere were a large number of other printers in the military service\nduring the civil war, but they were not territorial printers and their\nnames are not included in the above list.\n\nTERRITORIAL PRINTERS IN CIVIL LIFE.\n\nOne of the brightest of the many bright young men who came to\nMinnesota at an early day was Mr. James Mills. For a time he worked on\nthe case at the old Pioneer office, but was soon transferred to the\neditorial department, where he remained for a number of years. After\nthe war he returned to Pittsburgh, his former home, and is now and for\na number of years has been editor-in-chief of the Pittsburgh Post.\n\nAmong the numerous printers of St. Paul who were musically inclined\nno one was better known than the late O.G. Miller. He belonged to the\nGreat Western band, and was tenor singer in several churches in the\ncity for a number of years. Mr. Miller was a 33d Degree Mason, and\nwhen he died a midnight funeral service was held for him in Masonic\nhall, the first instance on record of a similar service in the city.\n\nGeorge W. Moore came to St. Paul in 1850, and for a short time was\nforeman for Mr. Goodhue. In 1852 he formed a partnership with John P.\nOwens in the publication of the Minnesotian. He sold his interest\nin that paper to Dr. Foster in 1860, and in 1861 was appointed by\nPresident Lincoln collector of the port of St. Paul, a position he\nheld for more than twenty years.\n\nLouis E. Fisher was one of God's noblemen. When he first came to St.\nPaul he was foreman of the Commercial Advertiser. For a long time he\nwas one of the editors of the Pioneer, and also the Pioneer Press. He\nwas a staunch democrat and a firm believer in Jeffersonian simplicity.\nAt one time he was a candidate for governor on the democratic ticket.\nHad it not been for a little political chicanery he would have been\nnominated, and had he been elected would have made a model governor.\n\nGeorge W. Armstrong was the Beau Brummel of the early printers. He\nwore kid gloves when he made up the forms of the old Pioneer, and he\nalways appeared as if he devoted more attention to his toilet than\nmost of his co-laborers. He was elected state treasurer on the\ndemocratic ticket in 1857, and at the expiration of his term of office\ndevoted his attention to the real estate business.\n\nAnother old printer that was somewhat fastidious was James M.\nCulver. He was the first delegate from St. Paul to the International\nTypographical Union. Old members of the Sons of Malta will recollect\nhow strenuously he resisted the canine portion of the ceremony when\ntaking the third degree of that noble order.\n\nWho has not heard of David Ramaley? He is one of the best as well as\none of the best known printers in the Northwest. He has been printer,\nreporter, editor, publisher and type founder. Although he has been\nconstantly in the harness for nearly fifty years, he is still active\nand energetic and looks as if it might be an easy matter to round out\nthe century mark.\n\nH.O. Bassford, now of the Austin Register, was one of the fleetest and\ncleanest compositers among the territorial printers. He was employed\non the Minnesotian.\n\nFrancis P. McNamee occupied most all positions connected with the\nprinting business--printer, reporter, editor. He was a most estimable\nman, but of very delicate constitution, and he has long since gone to\nhis reward.\n\nThe genial, jovial face of George W. Benedict was for many years\nfamiliar to most old-time residents. At one time he was foreman of the\nold St. Paul Press. He is now editor and publisher of the Sauk Rapids\nSentinel.\n\nThe old St. Paul Times had no more reliable man than the late Richard\nBradley. He was foreman of the job department of that paper, and held\nthe same position on the Press and Pioneer Press for many years.\n\nD.L. Paine was the author of the famous poem entitled \"Who Stole Ben\nJohnson's Spaces.\" He was employed in several of the St. Paul offices\nprevious to the rebellion.\n\nThe late John O. Terry was the first hand pressman in St. Paul.\nHe formed a partnership with Col. Owens in the publication of the\nMinnesotian. For a long time he was assistant postmaster of St. Paul,\nand held several other positions of trust.\n\nJ.B.H. Mitchell was a, member of the firm of Newson, Mitchell & Clum,\npublishers of the Daily Times. For several years after the war he was\nengaged as compositor in the St. Paul offices, and is now farming in\nNorthern Minnesota.\n\nAmong the freaks connected with the printing business was a poet\nprinter by the name of Wentworth. He was called \"Long Haired\nWentworth.\"\n\nEarly in the war he enlisted in the First Minnesota regiment. When\nCol. Gorman caught sight of him he ordered his hair cut. Wentworth\nwould not permit his flowing locks to be taken off, and he was\nsummarly dismissed from the service. After being ordered out of the\nregiment he wrote several letters of doubtful loyalty and Secretary\nStanton had him arrested and imprisoned in Fort Lafayette with other\npolitical prisoners. He never returned to Minnesota.\n\nMarshall Robinson was a partner of the late John H. Stevens in the\npublication of the first paper at Glencoe. At one time he was a\ncompositor on the Pioneer, and the last heard from him he was state\nprinter for Nevada.\n\nAndrew Jackson Morgan was brought to St. Paul by the late Col.\nD.A. Robertson and made foreman of the Democrat. He was a\nprinter-politician and possessed considerable ability. At one time he\nwas one of the editors of the Democrat. He was said to bear a striking\nresemblance to the late Stephen A. Douglas, and seldom conversed with\nany one without informing them of the fact. He was one of the original\nJacksonian Democrats, and always carried with him a silver dollar,\nwhich he claimed was given him by Andrew Jackson when he was\nchristened. No matter how much Democratic principle Jack would consume\non one of his electioneering tours he always clung to the silver\ndollar. He died in Ohio more than forty years ago, and it is said that\nthe immediate occasion of his demise was an overdose of hilarity.\n\nAnother old timer entitled to a good position in the hilarity column\nwas J.Q.A. Ward, commonly known as Jack Ward. He was business manager\nof the Minnesotian during the prosperous days of that paper. The first\nimmigration pamphlet ever gotten out in the territory was the product\nof Jack's ingenuity. Jack created quite a sensation at one time by\nmarrying the daughter of his employer on half an hour's ball room\nacquaintance. He was a very bright man and should have been one of the\nforemost business men of the city, but, like many other men, he was\nhis own worst enemy.\n\nAnother Jack that should not be overlooked was Jack Barbour. His\ntheory was that in case the fiery king interfered with your business\nit was always better to give up the business.\n\nA.M. Carver was one of the best job printers in the country, and he\nwas also one of the best amateur actors among the fraternity. It was\nno uncommon thing for the old time printers to be actors and actors to\nbe printers. Lawrence Barrett, Stuart Robson and many other eminent\nactors were knights of the stick and rule. Frequently during the happy\ndistribution hour printers could be heard quoting from the dramatist\nand the poet, and occasionally the affairs of church and state would\nreceive serious consideration, and often the subject would be handled\nin a manner that would do credit to the theologian or the diplomat,\nbut modern ingenuity has made it probable that no more statesmen will\nreceive their diplomas from the composing room. Since the introduction\nof the iron printer all these pleasantries have passed away, and the\nsociability that once existed in the composing room will be known\nhereafter only to tradition.\n\nThe late William Jebb was one of the readiest debaters in the old\nPioneer composing room. He was well posted on all topics and was\nalways ready to take either side of a question for the sake of\nargument. Possessing a command of language and fluency of speech that\nwould have been creditable to some of the foremost orators, he would\ntalk by the hour, and his occasional outbursts of eloquence often\nsurprised and always entertained the weary distributors. At one time\nJebb was reporter on the St. Paul Times. Raising blooded chickens\nwas one of his hobbies. One night some one entered his premises and\nappropriated, a number of his pet fowls. The next day the Times had a\nlong account of his misfortune, and at the conclusion of his article\nhe hurled the pope's bull of excommunication at the miscreant. It was\na fatal bull and was Mr. Jebb's reportorial finish.\n\nA fresh graduate from the case at one time wrote a scurrilous\nbiography of Washington. The editor of the paper on which he was\nemployed was compelled to make editorial apology for its unfortunate\nappearance. To make the matter more offensive the author on several\ndifferent occasions reproduced the article and credited its authorship\nto the editor who was compelled to apologize for it.\n\nIn two different articles on nationalities by two different young\nprinter reporters, one referred to the Germans as \"the beer-guzzling\nDutch,\" and the other, speaking of the English said \"thank the Lord we\nhave but few of them in our midst,\" caused the writers to be promptly\nrelegated back to the case.\n\nBishop Willoughby was a well-known character of the early times. A\nshort conversation with him would readily make patent the fact that he\nwasn't really a bishop. In an account of confirming a number of people\nat Christ church a very conscientious printer-reporter said \"Bishop\nWilloughby administered the rite of confirmation,\" when he should have\nsaid Bishop Whipple. He was so mortified at his unfortunate blunder\nthat he at once tendered his resignation. Of course it was not\naccepted.\n\nEditors and printers of territorial times were more closely affiliated\nthan they are to-day. Meager hotel accommodations and necessity for\neconomical habits compelled many of them to work and sleep in the same\nroom. All the offices contained blankets and cots, and as morning\nnewspapers were only morning newspapers in name, the tired and weary\nprinter could sleep the sleep of the just without fear of disturbance.\n\nNearly all the early editors were also printers. Earle S. Goodrich,\neditor-in-chief of the Pioneer: Thomas Foster, editor of the\nMinnesotian; T.M. Newson, editor of the Times, and John P. Owens,\nfirst editor of the Minnesotian, were all printers. When the old Press\nremoved from Bridge Square in 1869 to the new building on the corner\nof Third and Minnesota streets, Earle S. Goodrich came up into the\ncomposing room and requested the privilege of setting the first type\nin the new building. He was provided with a stick and rule and set\nup about half a column of editorial without copy. The editor of the\nPress, in commenting on his article, said it was set up as \"clean as\nthe blotless pages of Shakespeare.\" In looking over the article the\nnext morning some of the typos discovered an error in the first line.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DECISIVE BATTLE OF MILL SPRINGS.\n\nTHE FIRST BATTLE DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN WHICH THE UNION FORCES SCORED\nA DECISIVE VICTORY--THE SECOND MINNESOTA THE HEROES OF THE DAY--THE\nREBEL GENERAL ZOLLICOFFER KILLED.\n\n\nEvery Minnesotian's heart swells with pride whenever mention is made\nof the grand record of the volunteers from the North Star State in the\ngreat struggle for the suppression of the rebellion. At the outbreak\nof the war Minnesota was required to furnish one regiment, but so\nintensely patriotic were its citizens that nearly two regiments\nvolunteered at the first call of the president. As only ten companies\ncould go in the first regiment the surplus was held in readiness for\na second call, which it was thought would be soon forthcoming. On the\n16th of June, 1861, Gov. Ramsey received notice that a second regiment\nwould be acceptable, and accordingly the companies already organized\nwith two or three additions made up the famous Second Minnesota. H.P.\nVan Cleve was appointed colonel, with headquarters at Fort Snelling.\nSeveral of the companies were sent to the frontier to relieve\ndetachments of regulars stationed at various posts, but on the 16th of\nOctober, 1861, the full regiment started for Washington. On reaching\nPittsburgh, however, their destination was changed to Louisville, at\nwhich place they were ordered to report to Gen. W.T. Sherman, then in\ncommand of the Department of the Cumberland, and they at once received\norders to proceed to Lebanon Junction, about thirty miles south of\nLouisville. The regiment remained at this camp about six weeks before\nanything occurred to relieve the monotony of camp life, although there\nwere numerous rumors of night attacks by large bodies of Confederates.\nOn the 15th of November, 1861, Gen. Buell assumed command of all the\nvolunteers in the vicinity of Louisville, and he at once organized\nthem into divisions and brigades. Early in December the Second\nregiment moved to Lebanon, Ky., and, en route, the train was fired at.\nAt Lebanon the Second Minnesota, Eighteenth United States infantry,\nNinth and Thirty-fifth Ohio regiments were organized into a brigade,\nand formed part of Gen. George H. Thomas' First division. On Jan. 1,\n1862, Gen. Thomas started his troops on the Mill Springs campaign\nand from the 1st to the 17th day of January, spent most of its time\nmarching under rain, sleet and through mud, and on the latter date\nwent into camp near Logan's Cross Roads, eight miles north of\nZollicoffer's intrenched rebel camp at Beech Grove. On the night of\nJan. 18, Company A was on picket duty. It had been raining incessantly\nand was so dark that it was with difficulty that pickets could be\nrelieved. Just at daybreak the rebel advance struck the pickets of\nthe Union lines, and several musket shots rang out with great\ndistinctness, and in quick succession, it being the first rebel shot\nthat the boys had ever heard. Then all was quiet for a time. The\nfiring soon commenced again, nearer and more distinct than at first,\nand thicker and faster as the rebel advance encountered the Union\npickets. The Second Minnesota had entered the woods and passing\nthrough the Tenth Indiana, then out of ammunition and retiring and no\nlonger firing. The enemy, emboldened by the cessation and mistaking\nits cause, assumed they had the Yanks on the run, advanced to the rail\nfence separating the woods from the field just as the Second Minnesota\nwas doing the same, and while the rebels got there first, they were\nalso first to get away and make a run to their rear. But before\nthey ran their firing was resumed and Minnesotians got busy and the\nFifteenth Mississippi and the Sixteenth Alabama regiments were made\nto feel that they had run up against something. To the right of the\nSecond were two of Kinney's cannon and to their right was the Ninth\nOhio. The mist and smoke which hung closely was too thick to see\nthrough, but by lying down it was possible to look under the smoke and\nto see the first rebel line, and that it was in bad shape, and back of\nit and down on the low ground a second line, with their third line\non the high ground on the further side of the field. That the Second\nMinnesota was in close contact with the enemy was evident all along\nits line, blasts of fire and belching smoke coming across the fence\nfrom Mississippi muskets. The contest was at times hand to hand--the\nSecond Minnesota and the rebels running their guns through the fence,\nfiring and using the bayonet when opportunity offered. The firing was\nvery brisk for some time when it was suddenly discovered that\nthe enemy had disappeared. The battle was over, the Johnnies had\n\"skedaddled,\" leaving their dead and dying on the bloody field. Many\nof the enemy were killed and wounded, and some few surrendered. After\nthe firing had ceased one rebel lieutenant bravely stood in front\nof the Second and calmly faced his fate. After being called on to\nsurrender he made no reply, but deliberately raised his hand and shot\nLieut. Stout through the body. He was instantly shot. His name proved\nto be Bailie Peyton, son of one of the most prominent Union men in\nTennessee. Gen. Zollicoffer, commander of the Confederate forces, was\nalso killed in this battle. This battle, although a mere skirmish when\ncompared to many other engagements in which the Second participated\nbefore the close of the war, was watched with great interest by the\npeople of St. Paul. Two full companies had been recruited in the city\nand there was quite a number of St. Paulites in other companies of\nthis regiment. When it became known that a battle had been fought\nin which the Second had been active participants, the relatives and\nfriends of the men engaged in the struggle thronged the newspaper\noffices in quest of information regarding their safety. The casualties\nin the Second Minnesota, amounted to twelve killed and thirty-five\nwounded. Two or three days after the battle letters were received from\ndifferent members of the Second, claiming that they had shot Bailie\nPayton and Zollicoffer. It afterward was learned that no one ever\nknew who shot Peyton, and that Col. Fry of the Fourth Kentucky shot\nZollicoffer. Lieut. Tuttle captured Peyton's sword and still has it in\nhis possession. This sword has a historic record. It was presented to\nBailie Peyton by the citizens of New Orleans at the outbreak of the\nMexican war, and was carried by Col. Peyton during the entire war.\nCol. Peyton was on Gen. Scott's staff at the close of the war, and\nwhen Santa Anna surrendered the City of Mexico to Gen. Scott, Col.\nPeyton was the staff officer designated by Scott to receive the\nsurrender of the city, carrying this sword by his side. It bears\nthis inscription: \"Presented to Col. Bailie Peyton, Fifth Regiment\nLouisiana Volunteer National Guards, by his friends of New Orleans.\nHis country required his services. His deeds will add glory to\nher arms.\" There has been considerable correspondence between the\ngovernment and state, officials and the descendants of Col. Peyton\nrelative to returning this trophy to Col. Peyton's relatives, but so\nfar no arrangements to that effect have been concluded.\n\nIt was reported by Tennesseeans at the time of the battle that young\nPeyton was what was known as a \"hoop-skirt\" convert to the Confederate\ncause. Southern ladies were decidedly more pronounced secessionists\nthan were the sterner sex, and whenever they discovered that one of\ntheir chivalric brethren was a little lukewarm toward the cause of the\nSouth they sent him a hoop skirt, which indicated that the recipient\nwas lacking in bravery. For telling of his loyalty to the Union he\nwas insulted and hissed at on the streets of Nashville, and when he\nreceived a hoop skirt from his lady friends he reluctantly concluded\nto take up arms against the country he loved so well. He paid the\npenalty of foolhardy recklessness in the first battle in which he\nparticipated.\n\nA correspondent of the Cincinnati Commercial, who was an eye-witness\nof the battle, gave a glowing description of the heroic conduct of the\nSecond Minnesota during the engagement. He said: \"The success of the\nbattle was when the Second Minnesota and the Ninth Ohio appeared in\ngood order sweeping through the field. The Second Minnesota, from its\nposition in the column, was almost in the center of the fight, and in\nthe heaviest of the enemy's fire. They were the first troops that used\nthe bayonet, and the style with which they went into the fight is the\ntheme of enthusiastic comment throughout the army.\"\n\nIt was the boast of Confederate leaders at the outbreak of the\nrebellion that one regiment of Johnnies was equal to two or more\nregiments of Yankees. After the battle of Mill Springs they had\noccasion to revise their ideas regarding the fighting qualities of the\ndetested Yankees. From official reports of both sides, gathered after\nthe engagement was over, it was shown that the Confederate forces\noutnumbered their Northern adversaries nearly three to one.\n\nThe victory proved a dominant factor in breaking up the Confederate\nright flank, and opened a way into East Tennessee, and by transferring\nthe Union troops to a point from which to menace Nashville made the\nwithdrawal of Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston's troops from Bowling Green,\nKy., to Nashville necessary.\n\nConfederate loss, 600 in killed, wounded and prisoners. Union loss,\n248 in killed and wounded. Twelve rebel cannon and caissons complete\nwere captured. Two hundred wagons with horses in harness were\ncaptured, as were large quantities of ammunition, store and camp\nequipments--in fact, the Union troops took all there was.\n\nCol. Fry's version of the killing of Zollicoffer is as follows: While\non the border of \"old fields\" a stranger in citizen clothes rode up by\nhis side, so near that he could have put his hand upon his shoulder,\nand said: \"Don't let us be firing on our own men. Those are our men,\"\npointing at the same time toward our forces. Col. Fry looked upon him\ninquiringly a moment, supposing him to be one of his own men, after\nwhich he rode forward not more than fifteen paces, when an officer\ncame dashing up, first recognizing the stranger and almost the same\ninstant firing upon Col. Fry. At the same moment the stranger wheeled\nhis horse, facing Col. Fry, when the colonel shot him in the breast.\n\nGen. Zollicoffer was a prominent and influential citizen of Nashville\nprevious to the war, and stumped the state with Col. Peyton in\nopposition to the ordinance of secession, but when Tennessee seceded\nhe determined to follow the fortunes of his state. The day before the\nbattle Gen. Zollicoffer made a speech to his troops in which he said\nhe would take them to Indiana or go to hell himself. He didn't go to\nIndiana.\n\nThe poet of the Fourth Kentucky perpetrated the following shortly\nafter the battle:\n\n  \"Old Zollicoffer is dead\n  And the last word he said:\n  I see a wild cat coming.\n  Up steps Col. Fry.\n  And he hit him in the eye\n  And he sent him to the happy land of Canaan.\n  Ho! boys, ho!\n  For the Union go!\n  Hip hurrah for the happy land of freedom.\"\n\nThe loyal Kentuckians were in great glee and rejoiced over the\nvictory. It was their battle against rebel invaders from Tennessee,\nMississippi and Alabama, who were first met by their own troops of\nWolford's First cavalry and the Fourth Kentucky infantry, whose blood\nwas the first to be shed in defense of the Stars and Stripes; and\ntheir gratitude went out to their neighbors from Minnesota, Indiana\nand Ohio who came to their support and drove the invaders out of their\nstate. On Feb. 24, 1862, the Second Minnesota was again in Louisville,\nwhere the regiment had admirers and warm friends in the loyal ladies,\nwho as evidence of their high appreciation, though the mayor of the\ncity, Hon. J.M. Dolph, presented to the Second regiment a silk flag.\nThe mayor said. \"Each regiment is equally entitled to like honor, but\nthe gallant conduct of those who came from a distant state to unite\nin subduing our rebel invaders excites the warmest emotions of our\nhearts.\"\n\nOn Jan. 25 President Lincoln's congratulations were read to the\nregiment, and on Feb. 9, at Waitsboro, Ky., the following joint\nresolution of the Minnesota legislature was read before the regiment:\n\n\nWhereas, the noble part borne by the First regiment, Minnesota\ninfantry, in the battles of Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, Va., is\nyet fresh in our minds; and, whereas, we have heard with equal\nsatisfaction the intelligence of the heroism displayed by the Second\nMinnesota infantry in the late brilliant action at Mill Springs, Ky.:\n\nTherefore be it resolved by the legislature of Minnesota, That while\nit was the fortune of the veteran First regiment to shed luster upon\ndefeat, it was reserved for the glorious Second regiment to add\nvictory to glory.\n\nResolved, that the bravery of our noble sons, heroes whether in defeat\nor victory, is a source of pride to the state that sent them forth,\nand will never fail to secure to them the honor and the homage of the\ngovernment and the people.\n\nResolved, That we sympathize with the friends of our slain soldiers,\nclaiming as well to share their grief as to participate in the renown\nwhich the virtues and valor of the dead have conferred on our arms.\n\nResolved, That a copy of these resolutions, having the signature\nof the executive and the great seal of the state, be immediately\nforwarded by the governor to the colonels severally in command of\nthe regiments, to be by them communicated to their soldiers at dress\nparade.\n\nThe battle at Mill Springs was the first important victory achieved by\nthe Union army in the Southwest after the outbreak of the rebellion,\nand the result of that engagement occasioned great rejoicing\nthroughout the loyal North. Although the battle was fought forty-five\nyears ago, quite a number of men engaged in that historic event\nare still living in St. Paul, a number of them actively engaged in\nbusiness. Among the number are J.W. Bishop, J.C. Donahower, M.C.\nTuttle, R.A. Lanpher, M.J. Clum, William Bircher, Robert G. Rhodes,\nJohn H. Gibbons, William Wagner, Joseph Burger, Jacob J. Miller,\nChristian Dehn, William Kemper, Jacob Bernard, Charles F. Myer,\nPhillip Potts and Fred Dohm.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT BATTLE OF PITTSBURG LANDING.\n\nA BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST SANGUINARY BATTLES\nOF THE CIVIL WAR--TERRIBLE LOSS OF LIFE--GALLANT ACTION OF THE FIRST\nMINNESOTA BATTERY--DEATH OF CAPT. W.H. ACKER.\n\n\nThe battle of Pittsburg Landing on the 6th and 7th of April, 1862, was\none of the most terrific of the many great battles of the great Civil\nwar. It has been likened to the battle of Waterloo. Napoleon sought to\ndestroy the army of Wellington before a junction could be made with\nBlucher. Johnston and Beauregard undertook to annihilate the Army of\nthe Tennessee, under Gen. Grant, before the Army of the Cumberland,\nunder Buell, could come to his assistance. At the second battle of\nBull Run Gen. Pope claimed that Porter was within sound of his guns,\nyet he remained inactive. At Pittsburg Landing it was claimed by\nmilitary men that Gen. Buell could have made a junction with Grant\ntwenty-four hours sooner and thereby saved a terrible loss of life had\nhe chosen to do so. Both generals were subsequently suspended from\ntheir commands and charges of disloyalty were made against them by\nmany newspapers in the North. Gen. Porter was tried by court-martial\nand dismissed from the service. Many years after this decision was\nrevoked by congress and the stigma of disloyalty removed from his\nname. Gen. Buell was tried by court-martial, but the findings of the\ncourt were never made public. Gen. Grant did not think Gen. Buell\nwas guilty of the charges against him, and when he became\ncommander-in-chief of the army in 1864 endeavored to have him restored\nto his command, but the war department did not seem inclined to do so.\nAbout two weeks before the battle of Pittsburg Landing Gen. Grant\nwas suspended from the command of the Army of the Tennessee by Gen.\nHalleck, but owing to some delay in the transmission of the order, an\norder came from headquarters restoring him to his command before he\nknew that he had been suspended. Gen. Grant's success at Fort Henry\nand Fort Donelson made his superiors jealous of his popularity. He was\nordered arrested by Gen. McClellan, but the order was held up by the\nwar department until Gen. Grant could be heard from. The reason for\nhis arrest was that he went to Nashville to consult with Buell without\npermission of the commanding general. Dispatches sent to Grant for\ninformation concerning his command was never delivered to him, but\nwere delivered over to the rebel authorities by a rebel telegraph\noperator, who shortly afterward joined the Confederate forces.\n\nMany years after the war Gen. Badeau, one of Grant's staff officers,\nwas in search of information for his \"History of Grant's Military\nCampaigns,\" and he unearthed in the archives of the war department the\nfull correspondence between Halleck, McClellan and the secretary of\nwar, and it was not until then that Gen. Grant learned the full extent\nof the absurd accusations made against him.\n\nAfter the battle of Pittsburg Landing Gen. Halleck assumed personal\ncommand of all the forces at that point and Gen. Grant was placed\nsecond in command, which meant that he had no command at all. This\nwas very distasteful to Gen. Grant and he would have resigned his\ncommission and returned to St. Louis but for the interposition of his\nfriend, Gen. W.T. Sherman. Gen. Grant had packed up his belongings\nand was about to depart when Gen. Sherman met him at his tent and\npersuaded him to refrain. In a short time Halleck was ordered to\nWashington and Grant was made commander of the Department of West\nTennessee, with headquarters at Memphis. Gen. Grant's subsequent\ncareer proved the wisdom of Sherman's entreaty.\n\nWhen Gen. Halleck assumed command he constructed magnificent\nfortifications, and they were a splendid monument to his engineering\nskill, but they were never occupied. He was like the celebrated king\nof France, who \"with one hundred thousand men, marched up the hill and\nthen down again.\" Gen. Halleck had under his immediate command more\nthan one hundred thousand well equipped men, and the people of\nthe North looked to him to administer a crushing blow to the then\nretreating enemy. The hour had arrived--the man had not.\n\n\"Flushed with the victory of Forts Henry and Donelson,\" said the\nenvious Halleck in a dispatch to the war department, previous to\nthe battle, \"the army under Grant at Pittsburg Landing was more\ndemoralized than the Army of the Potomac after the disastrous defeat\nof Bull Run.\"\n\n\nSoon after the battle the venerable Gen. Scott predicted that the\nwar would soon be ended--that thereafter there would be nothing but\nguerrilla warfare at interior points. Gen. Grant himself in his\nmemoirs says that had the victory at Pittsburg Landing been followed\nup and the army been kept intact the battles at Stone River,\nChattanooga and Chickamauga would not have been necessary.\n\nProbably the battle of Pittsburg Landing was the most misunderstood\nand most misrepresented of any battle occurring during the war. It\nwas charged that Grant was drunk; that he was far away from the\nbattleground when the attack was made, and was wholly unprepared to\nmeet the terrible onslaught of the enemy in the earlier stages of the\nencounter. Gen. Beauregard is said to have stated on the morning\nof the battle that before sundown he would water his horses in the\nTennessee river or in hell. That the rebels did not succeed in\nreaching the Tennessee was not from lack of dash and daring on their\npart, but was on account of the sturdy resistance and heroism of their\nadversaries. According to Gen. Grant's own account of the battle,\nthough suffering intense pain from a sprained ankle, he was in the\nsaddle from early morning till late at night, riding from division to\ndivision, giving directions to their commanding officers regarding the\nmany changes in the disposition of their forces rendered necessary\nby the progress of the battle. The firm resistance made by the force\nunder his command is sufficient refutation of the falsity of the\ncharges made against him. Misunderstanding of orders, want of\nco-operation of subordinates as well as superiors, and rawness of\nrecruits were said to have been responsible for the terrible slaughter\nof the Union forces on the first day of the battle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe battle of Pittsburg Landing is sometimes called the battle of\nShiloh, some of the hardest lighting having been done in the vicinity\nof an old log church called the Church of Shiloh, about three miles\nfrom the landing.\n\nThe battle ground traversed by the opposing forces occupied a\nsemi-circle of about three and a half miles from the town of\nPittsburg, the Union forces being stationed in the form of a\nsemi-circle, the right resting on a point north of Crump's Landing,\nthe center being directly in front of the road to Corinth, and the\nleft extending to the river in the direction of Harrisburg--a small\nplace north of Pittsburg Landing. At about 2 o'clock on Sunday\nmorning, Col. Peabody of Prentiss' division, fearing that everything\nwas not right, dispatched a body of 400 men beyond the camp for the\npurpose of looking after any body of men which might be lurking in\nthat direction. This step was wisely taken, for a half a mile advance\nshowed a heavy force approaching, who fired upon them with great\nslaughter. This force taken by surprise, was compelled to retreat,\nwhich they did in good order under a galling fire. At 6 o'clock the\nfire had become general along the entire front, the enemy having\ndriven in the pickets of Gen. Sherman's division and had fallen with\nvengeance upon three Ohio regiments of raw recruits, who knew nothing\nof the approach of the enemy until they were within their midst. The\nslaughter on the first approach of the enemy was very severe, scores\nfalling at every discharge of rebel guns. It soon became apparent that\nthe rebel forces were approaching in overwhelming numbers and there\nwas nothing left for them to do but retreat, which was done with\nconsiderable disorder, both officers and men losing every particle of\ntheir baggage, which fell into rebel hands.\n\n\nAt 8:30 o'clock the fight had become general, the second line of\ndivisions having received the advance in good order and made every\npreparation for a suitable reception of the foe. At this time many\nthousand stragglers, many of whom had never before heard the sound\nof musketry, turned their backs to the enemy, and neither threats or\npersuasion could induce them to turn back. The timely arrival of Gen.\nGrant, who had hastened up from Savannah, led to the adoption of\nmeasures that put a stop to this uncalled-for flight from the battle\nground. A strong guard was placed across the thoroughfare, with orders\nto hault every soldier whose face was turned toward the river, and\nthus a general stampede was prevented. At 10 o'clock the entire line\non both sides was engaged in one of the most terrible battles ever\nknown in this country. The roar of the cannon and musketry was without\nintermission from the main center to a point extending halfway down\nthe left wing. The great struggle was most upon the forces which had\nfallen back on Sherman's position. By 11 o'clock quite a number of the\ncommanders of regiments had fallen, and in some instances not a single\nfield officer remained; yet the fighting continued with an earnestness\nthat plainly showed that the contest on both sides was for death or\nvictory. The almost deafening sound of artillery and the rattle of\nmusketry was all that could be heard as the men stood silently and\ndelivered their fire, evidently bent on the work of destruction which\nknew no bounds. Foot by foot the ground was contested, a single narrow\nstrip of open land dividing the opponents. Many who were maimed fell\nback without help, while others still fought in the ranks until they\nwere actually forced back by their company officers. Finding it\nimpossible to drive back the center of our column, at 12 o'clock the\nenemy slackened fire upon it and made a most vigorous effort on our\nleft wing, endeavoring to drive it to the river bank at a point about\na mile and a half above Pittsburg Landing. With the demonstration of\nthe enemy upon the left wing it was soon seen that all their fury was\nbeing poured out upon it, with a determination that it should give\nway. For about two hours a sheet of fire blazed both columns, the\nrattle of musketry making a most deafening noise. For about an hour it\nwas feared that the enemy would succeed in driving our forces to the\nriver bank, the rebels at times being plainly seen by those on the\nmain landing below. While the conflict raged the hottest in this\nquarter the gunboat Tyler passed slowly up the river to a point\ndirectly opposite the enemy and poured in a broadside from her immense\nguns. The shells went tearing and crashing through the woods, felling\ntrees in their course and spreading havoc wherever they fell. The\nexplosions were fearful, the shells falling far inland, and they\nstruck terror to the rebel force. Foiled in this attempt, they now\nmade another attack on the center and fought like tigers. They found\nour lines well prepared and in full expectation of their coming. Every\nman was at his post and all willing to bring the contest to a definite\nconclusion. In hourly expectation of the arrival of reinforcements,\nunder Generals Nelson and Thomas of Buell's army, they made every\neffort to rout our forces before the reinforcements could reach the\nbattle ground. They were, however, fighting against a wall of steel.\nVolley answered volley and for a time the battle of the morning was\nre-enacted on the same ground and with the same vigor on both sides.\nAt 5 o'clock there was a short cessation in the firing of the enemy,\ntheir lines falling back on the center for about half a mile. They\nagain wheeled and suddenly threw their entire force upon the left\nwing, determined to make the final struggle of the day in that\nquarter. The gunboat Lexington in the meantime had arrived from\nSavannah, and after sending a message to Gen. Grant to ascertain in\nwhich direction the enemy was from the river, the Lexington and Tyler\ntook a position about half a mile above the river landing, and poured\ntheir shells up a deep ravine reaching to the river on the right.\nTheir shots were thick and fast and told with telling effect. In the\nmeantime Gen. Lew Wallace, who had taken a circuitous route from\nCrump's Landing, appeared suddenly on the left wing of the rebels. In\nface of this combination the enemy felt that their bold effort was for\nthe day a failure and as night was about at hand, they slowly fell\nback, fighting as they went, until they reached an advantageous\nposition, somewhat in the rear, yet occupying the main road to\nCorinth. The gunboats continued to send their shells after them until\nthey were far beyond reach. This ended the engagement for the day.\nThroughout the day the rebels evidently had fought with the Napoleonic\nidea of massing their entire force on weak points of the enemy, with\nthe intention of braking through their lines, creating a panic and\ncutting off retreat.\n\n\nThe first day's battle, though resulting in a terrible loss of Union\ntroops, was in reality a severe disappointment to the rebel leaders.\nThey fully expected, with their overwhelming force to annihilate\nGrant's army, cross the Tennessee river and administer the same\npunishment to Buell, and then march on through Tennessee, Kentucky and\ninto Ohio. They had conceived a very bold movement, but utterly failed\nto execute it.\n\nGen. Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of the Confederate forces,\nwas killed in the first day's battle, being shot while attempting to\ninduce a brigade of unwilling Confederates to make a charge on the\nenemy.\n\nGen. Buell was at Columbia, Tenn., on the 19th of March with a veteran\nforce of 40,000 men, and it required nineteen days for him to reach\nthe Tennessee river, eighty-five miles distant, marching less than\nfive miles a day, notwithstanding the fact that he had been ordered to\nmake a junction with Grant's forces as soon as possible, and was well\ninformed of the urgency of the situation.\n\nDuring the night steamers were engaged in carrying the troops of\nNelson's division across the river. As soon as the boats reached the\nshore the troops immediately left, and, without music, took their way\nto the advance of the left wing of the Union forces. They had come up\ndouble quick from Savannah, and as they were regarded as veterans, the\ngreatest confidence was soon manifest as to the successful termination\nof the battle. With the first hours of daylight it was evident that\nthe enemy had also been strongly reinforced, for, notwithstanding they\nmust have known of the arrival of new Union troops, they were first to\nopen the ball, which they did with considerable alacrity. The attacks\nthat began came from the main Corinth road, a point to which they\nseemed strongly attached, and which at no time did they leave\nunprotected. Within half an hour from the first firing in the morning\nthe contest then again spread in either direction, and both the main\nand left wings were not so anxious to fight their way to the river\nbank as on the previous day, having a slight experience of what they\nmight expect if again brought under the powerful guns of the Tyler and\nLexington. They were not, however, lacking in activity, and they\nwere met by our reinforced troops with an energy that they did not\nanticipate. At 9 o'clock the sound of the artillery and musketry fully\nequaled that of the day before. It now became evident that the rebels\nwere avoiding our extreme left wing, and were endeavoring to find a\nweak point in our line by which they could turn our force and thus\ncreate a panic. They left one point but to return to it immediately,\nand then as suddenly would direct an assault upon a division where\nthey imagined they would not be expected. The fire of the united\nforces was as steady as clockwork, and it soon became evident that\nthe enemy considered the task they had undertaken a hopeless one.\nNotwithstanding continued repulses, the rebels up to 11 o'clock had\ngiven no evidence of retiring from the field. Their firing had been as\nrapid and vigorous at times as during the most terrible hours of\nthe previous day. Generals Grant, Buell, Nelson and Crittenden were\npresent everywhere directing the movements on our part for a new\nstrike against the foe. Gen. Lew Wallace's division on the right had\nbeen strongly reinforced, and suddenly both wings of our army were\nturned upon the enemy, with the intention of driving the immense body\ninto an extensive ravine. At the same time a powerful battery had been\nstationed upon an open field, and they poured volley after volley into\nthe rebel ranks and with the most telling effect. At 11:30 o'clock the\nroar of battle almost shook the earth, as the Union guns were being\nfired with all the energy that the prospect of ultimate victory\ninspired. The fire from the enemy was not so vigorous and they began\nto evince a desire to withdraw. They fought as they slowly moved back,\nkeeping up their fire from their artillery and musketry, apparently\ndisclaiming any notion that they thought of retreating. As they\nretreated they went in excellent order, halting at every advantageous\npoint and delivering their fire with considerable effect. At noon it\nwas settled beyond dispute that the rebels were retreating. They were\nmaking but little fire, and were heading their center column for\nCorinth. From all divisions of our lines they were closely pursued,\na galling fire being kept up on their rear, which they returned at\nintervals with little or no effect. From Sunday morning until Monday\nnoon not less than three thousand cavalry had remained seated In their\nsaddles on the hilltop overlooking the river, patiently awaiting the\ntime when an order should come for them to pursue the flying enemy.\nThat time had now arrived and a courier from Gen. Grant had scarcely\ndelivered his message before the entire body was in motion. The wild\ntumult of the excited riders presented a picture seldom witnessed on a\nbattlefield. Gen. Grant himself led the charge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGen. Grant, in his memoirs, summarizes the results of the two days'\nfighting as follows: \"I rode forward several miles the day of the\nbattle and found that the enemy had dropped nearly all of their\nprovisions and other luggage in order to enable them to get off with\ntheir guns. An immediate pursuit would have resulted in the capture\nof a considerable number of prisoners and probably some guns....\" The\neffective strength of the Union forces on the morning of the 6th was\n33,000 men. Lew Wallace brought 5,000 more after nightfall. Beauregard\nreported the rebel strength at 40,955. Excluding the troops who fled,\nthere was not with us at any time during the day more than 25,000 men\nin line. Our loss in the two days' fighting was 1,754 killed, 8,408\nwounded and 2,885 missing. Beauregard reported a total loss of 10,699,\nof whom 1,728 were killed, 8,012 wounded and 957 missing.\n\n\nOn the first day of the battle Gen. Prentiss, during a change of\nposition of the Union forces, became detached from the rest of the\ntroops, and was taken prisoner, together with 2,200 of his men. Gen.\nW.H.L. Wallace, division commander, was killed in the early part of\nthe struggle.\n\nThe hardest fighting during the first day was done in front of the\ndivisions of Sherman and McClernand. \"A casualty to Sherman,\" says\nGen. Grant, \"that would have taken him from the field that day would\nhave been a sad one for the Union troops engaged at Shiloh. And how\nnear we came to this! On the 6th Sherman was shot twice, once in the\nhand, once in the shoulder, the ball cutting his coat and making a\nslight wound, and a third ball passed through his hat. In addition to\nthis he had several horses shot during the day.\"\n\nDuring the second day of the battle Gen. Grant, Col. McPherson and\nMaj. Hawkins got beyond the left of our troops. There did not appear\nto be an enemy in sight, but suddenly a battery opened on them from\nthe edge of the woods. They made a hasty retreat and when they were\nat a safe distance halted to take an account of the damage. In a few\nmoments Col. McPherson's horse dropped dead, having been shot just\nback of the saddle. A ball had passed through Maj. Hawkins' hat and a\nball had struck the metal of Gen. Grant's sword, breaking it nearly\noff.\n\nOn the first day of the battle about 6,000 fresh recruits who had\nnever before heard the sound of musketry, fled on the approach of the\nenemy. They hid themselves on the river bank behind the bluff, and\nneither command nor persuasion could induce them to move. When Gen.\nBuell discovered them on his arrival he threatened to fire on them,\nbut it had no effect. Gen. Grant says that afterward those same men\nproved to be some of the best soldiers in the service.\n\nGen. Grant, in his report, says he was prepared with the\nreinforcements of Gen. Lew Wallace's division of 5,000 men to assume\nthe offensive on the second day of the battle, and thought he could\nhave driven the rebels back to their fortified position at Corinth\nwithout the aid of Buell's army.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt banquet hall, regimental reunion or campfire, whenever mention is\nmade of the glorious record of Minnesota volunteers in the great Civil\nwar, seldom, if ever, is the First Minnesota battery given credit\nfor its share in the long struggle. Probably very few of the present\nresidents of Minnesota are aware that such an organization existed.\nThis battery was one of the finest organizations that left the state\nduring the great crisis. It was in the terrible battle of Pittsburg\nLanding, the siege of Vicksburg, in front of Atlanta and in the great\nmarch from Atlanta to the sea, and in every position in which they\nwere placed they not only covered themselves with glory, but they were\nan honor and credit to the state that sent them. The First Minnesota\nbattery, light artillery, was organized at Fort Snelling in the fall\nof 1861, and Emil Munch was made its first captain. Shortly after\nbeing mustered in they were ordered to St. Louis, where they received\ntheir accoutrements, and from there they were ordered to Pittsburg\nLanding, arriving at the latter place late in February, 1862. The day\nbefore the battle, they were transferred to Prentiss' division of\nGrant's army. On Sunday morning, April 6, the battery was brought out\nbright and early, preparing for inspection. About 7 o'clock great\ncommotion was heard at headquarters, and the battery was ordered to be\nready to march at a moment's notice. In about ten minutes they were\nordered to the front, the rebels having opened fire on the Union\nforces. In a very short time rebel bullets commenced to come thick and\nfast, and one of their number was killed and three others wounded. It\nsoon became evident that the rebels were in great force in front\nof the battery, and orders were issued for them to choose another\nposition. At about 11 o'clock the battery formed in a new position\non an elevated piece of ground, and whenever the rebels undertook to\ncross the field in front of them the artillery raked them down with\nfrightful slaughter. Several times the rebels placed batteries In the\ntimber at the farther end of the field, but in each instance the\nguns of the First battery dislodged them before they could get into\nposition. For hours the rebels vainly endeavored to break the lines\nof the Union forces, but in every instance they were repulsed with\nfrightful loss, the canister mowing them down at close range. About 5\no'clock the rebels succeeded in flanking Gen. Prentiss and took part\nof his force prisoners. The battery was immediately withdrawn to an\nelevation near the Tennessee river, and it was not long before firing\nagain commenced and kept up for half an hour, the ground fairly\nshaking from the continuous firing on both sides of the line. At\nabout 6 o'clock the firing ceased, and the rebels withdrew to a safe\ndistance from the landing. The casualties of the day were three killed\nand six wounded, two of the latter dying shortly afterward. The fight\nat what was known as the \"hornet's nest\" was most terrific, and had\nnot the First battery held out so heroically and valiantly the rebels\nwould have succeeded in forcing a retreat of the Union lines to a\npoint dangerously near the Tennessee river. Capt. Munch's horse\nreceived a bullet In his head and fell, and the captain himself\nreceived a wound in the thigh, disabling him from further service\nduring the battle. After Capt. Munch was wounded Lieut. Pfaender took\ncommand of the battery, and he had a horse shot from under him during\nthe day. On the morning of April 7, Gen. Buell having arrived, the\nbattery was held in reserve and did not participate in the battle\nthat day. The First battery was the only organization from Minnesota\nengaged in the battle, and their conduct in the fiercest of the\nstruggle, and in changing position in face of fire from the whole\nrebel line, was such as to receive the warmest commendation from the\ncommanding officer. It was the first battle in which they had taken\npart, and as they had only received their guns and horses a few weeks\nbefore, they had not had much opportunity for drill work. Their\nterrible execution at critical times convinced the rebels that they\nhad met a foe worthy of their steel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmong the many thousands left dead and dying on the blood-stained\nfield of Pittsburg Landing there was one name that was very dear in\nthe hearts of the patriotic people of St. Paul,--a name that was as\ndear to the people of St. Paul as was the memory of the immortal\nEllsworth to the people of Chicago. Capt. William Henry Acker, while\nmarching at the head of his company, with uplifted sword and with\nvoice and action urging on his comrades to the thickest of the fray,\nwas pierced in the forehead by a rebel bullet and fell dead upon the\nill-fated field.\n\nBefore going into action Capt. Acker was advised by his comrades not\nto wear his full uniform, as he was sure to be a target for rebel\nbullets, but the captain is said to have replied that if he had to die\nhe would die with his harness on. Soon after forming his command into\nline, and when they had advanced only a few yards, he was singled out\nby a rebel sharpshooter and instantly killed--the only man in the.\ncompany to receive fatal injuries. \"Loved, almost adored, by the\ncompany,\" says one of them, writing of the sad event, \"Capt. Acker's\nfall cast a deep shadow of gloom over his command.\" It was but for\na moment. With a last look at their dead commander, and with the\nwatchword 'this for our captain,' volley after volley from their guns\ncarried death into the ranks of his murderers. From that moment but\none feeling seemed to possess his still living comrades--that of\nrevenge for the death of their captain. How terribly they carried out\nthat purpose the number of rebel slain piled around the vicinity of\nhis body fearfully attest.\n\nThe announcement of the death of Capt. Acker was a very severe blow to\nhis relatives and many friends in this city. No event thus far in the\nhistory of the Rebellion had brought to our doors such a realizing\nsense of the sad realities of the terrible havoc wrought upon the\nbattlefield. A noble life had been sacrificed in the cause of\nfreedom--one more name had been added to the long death roll of the\nnation's heroes.\n\nCapt. Acker was born a soldier--brave, able, popular and\ncourteous--and had he lived would undoubtedly been placed high in rank\nlong before the close of the rebellion. No person ever went to the\nfront in whom the citizens of St. Paul had more hope for a brilliant\nfuture. He was born in New York State in 1833, and was twenty-eight\nyears of age at the time of his death. He came to St. Paul in 1854 and\ncommenced the study of law in the office of his brother-in-law, Hon.\nEdmund Rice. He did not remain long in the law business, however, but\nsoon changed to a position in the Bank of Minnesota, which had just\nbeen established by ex-Gov. Marshall. For some time he was captain of\nthe Pioneer Guards, a company which he was instrumental in forming,\nand which was the finest military organization in the West at\nthat time. In 1860 he was chosen commander of the Wide-Awakes, a\nmarching-club, devoted to the promotion of the candidacy of Abraham\nLincoln, and many of the men he so patiently drilled during that\nexciting campaign became officers in the volunteer service in that\ngreat struggle that soon followed. Little did the captain imagine at\nthat time that the success of the man whose cause he espoused would so\nsoon be the means of his untimely death. At the breaking out of the\nwar Capt. Acker was adjutant general of the State of Minnesota, but he\nthought he would be of more use to his country in active service and\nresigned that position and organized a company for the First Minnesota\nregiment, of which he was made captain. At the first battle of Bull\nRun he was wounded, and for his gallant action was made captain in\nthe Seventeenth United States Regulars, an organization that had\nbeen recently created by act of congress. The Sixteenth regiment was\nattached to Buell's army, and participated in the second day's battle,\nand Cat. Acker was one of the first to fall on that terrible day,\nbeing shot in the identical spot in the forehead where he was wounded\nat the first battle of Bull Run. As soon as the news was received in\nSt. Paul of the captain's death his father, Hon. Henry Acker, left for\nPittsburg Landing, hoping to be able to recover the remains of his\nmartyred son and bring the body back to St. Paul. His body was easily\nfound, his burial place having been carefully marked by members of the\nSecond Minnesota who arrived on the battleground a short time after\nthe battle. When the remains arrived in St. Paul they were met at\nthe steamboat landing by a large number of citizens and escorted to\nMasonic hall, where they rested till the time of the funeral. The\nfuneral obsequies were held at St. Paul's church on Sunday, May 4,\n1862, and were attended by the largest concourse of citizens that\nhad ever attended a funeral in St. Paul, many being present from\nMinneapolis, St. Anthony and Stillwater. The respect shown to the\nmemory of Capt. Acker was universal, and of a character which fully\ndemonstrated the high esteem in which he was held by the people of St.\nPaul.\n\nWhen the first Grand Army post was formed in St. Paul a name\ncommemorative of one of Minnesota's fallen heroes was desired for the\norganization. Out of the long list of martyrs Minnesota gave to the\ncause of the Union no name seemed more appropriate than that of the\nheroic Capt. Acker, and it was unanimously decided that the first\nassociation of Civil war veterans in this city should be known as\nAcker post.\n\n\nTHE DEATH OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe terrible and sensational news that Abraham Lincoln had been\nassassinated, which was flashed over the wires on the morning of\nApril 15, 1865 (forty years ago yesterday), was the most appalling\nannouncement that had been made during the long crisis through which\nthe country had just passed. Every head was bowed in grief. No tongue\ncould find language sufficiently strong to express condemnation of the\nfiendish act. The entire country was plunged in mourning. It was not\nsafe for any one to utter a word against the character of the martyred\npresident. At no place in the entire country was the terrible calamity\nmore deeply felt than in St. Paul. All public and private buildings\nwere draped in mourning. Every church held memorial services. The\nservices at the little House of Hope church on Walnut street will long\nbe remembered by all those who were there. The church was heavily\ndraped in mourning. It had been suddenly transformed from a house of\nhope to a house of sorrow, a house of woe. The pastor of the church\nwas the Rev. Frederick A. Noble. He was one of the most eloquent and\nlearned divines in the city--fearless, forcible and aggressive--the\nHenry Ward Beecher of the Northwest. President Lincoln was his ideal\nstatesman.\n\nThe members of the House of Hope were intensely patriotic. Many of\ntheir number were at the front defending their imperiled country.\nScores and scores of times during the desperate conflict had the\neloquent pastor of this church delivered stirring addresses favoring\na vigorous prosecution of the war. During the darkest days of the\nRebellion, when the prospect of the final triumph of the cause of the\nUnion seemed furthest off, Mr. Noble never faltered; he believed that\nthe cause was just and that right would finally triumph. When the\nterrible and heart-rending news was received that an assassin's bullet\nhad ended the life of the greatest of all presidents the effect was\nso paralyzing that hearts almost ceased beating. Every member of the\ncongregation felt as if one of their own household had been suddenly\ntaken from them. The services at the church on the Sunday morning\nfollowing the assassination were most solemn and impressive. The\nlittle edifice was crowded almost to suffication, and when the pastor\nwas seen slowly ascending the pulpit, breathless silence prevailed. He\nwas pale and haggard, and appeared to be suffering great mental agony.\nWith bowed head and uplifted hands, and with a voice trembling with\nalmost uncontrollable emotion, he delivered one of the most fervent\nand impressive invocations ever heard by the audience. Had the dead\nbody of the president been placed in front of the altar, the solemnity\nof the occasion could not have been greater. In the discourse that\nfollowed, Mr. Noble briefly sketched the early history of the\npresident, and then devoted some time to the many grand deeds he had\naccomplished during the time he had been in the presidential chair.\nFor more than four years he had patiently and anxiously watched the\nprogress of the terrible struggle, and now, when victory was in sight,\nwhen it was apparent to all that the fall of Richmond, the surrender\nof Lee and the probable surrender of Johnston would end the long war,\nhe was cruelly stricken down by the hand of an assassin. \"With malice\ntowards none and with charity to all, and with firmness for the right,\nas God gives us to see the right,\" were utterances then fresh from the\npresident's lips. To strike down such a man at such a time was indeed\na crime most horrible. There was scarcely a dry eye in the audience.\nMen and women alike wept. It was supposed at the time that Secretary\nof State Seward had also fallen a victim of the assassin's dagger.\nIt was the purpose of the conspirators to murder the president, vice\npresident and entire cabinet, but in only one instance did the attempt\nprove fatal. Secretary Seward was the foremost statesmen of the\ntime. His diplomatic skill had kept the country free from foreign\nentanglements during the long and bitter struggle. He, too, was\neulogized by the minister, and it rendered the occasion doubly\nmournful.\n\nSince that time two other presidents have been mercilessly slain by\nthe hand of an assassin, and although the shock to the country was\nterrible, it never seemed as if the grief was as deep and universal\nas when the bullet fired by John Wilkes Booth pierced the temple of\nAbraham Lincoln.\n\n\n\n\nAN ALLEGORICAL HOROSCOPE\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIN TWO CHAPTERS.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCHAPTER I.--AN OPTIMISTIC FORECAST.\n\nAs the sun was gently receding in the western horizon on a beautiful\nsummer evening nearly a century ago, a solitary voyageur might have\nbeen seen slowly ascending the sinuous stream that stretches from the\nNorth Star State to the Gulf of Mexico. He was on a mission of peace\nand good will to the red men of the distant forest. On nearing the\nshore of what is now a great city the lonely voyageur was amazed\non discovering that the pale face of the white man had many years\npreceded him. \"What, ho!\" he muttered to himself; \"methinks I see a\npaleface toying with a dusky maiden. I will have speech with him.\" On\napproaching near where the two were engaged in some weird incantation\nthe voyageur overheard the dusky maiden impart a strange message to\nthe paleface by her side. \"From the stars I see in the firmament, the\nfixed stars that predominate in the configuration, I deduce the future\ndestiny of man. 'Tis with thee. O Robert, to live always. This elixer\nwhich I now do administer to thee has been known to our people for\ncountless generations. The possession of it will enable thee to\nconquer all thine enemies. Thou now beholdest, O Robert, the ground\nupon which some day a great city will be erected. Thou art destined to\nbecome the mighty chief of this great metropolis. Thy reign will be\nlong and uninterrupted. Thou wert born when the conjunction of the\nplanets did augur a life of perfect beatitude. As the years roll\naway the inhabitants of the city will multiply with great rapidity.\nQuestions of great import regarding the welfare of the people will\noften come before thee for adjustment. To be successful In thy calling\nthou must never be guilty of having decided convictions on any\nsubject, as thy friends will sometimes be pitted against each other in\nthe advocacy of their various schemes. Thou must not antagonize either\nside by espousing the other's cause, but must always keep the rod and\nthe gun close by thy side, so that when these emergencies arise and\nthou doth scent danger in the air thou canst quietly withdraw from the\nscene of action and chase the festive bison over the distant prairies\nor revel in piscatorial pleasure on the placid waters of a secluded\nlake until the working majority hath discovered some method of\nrelieving thee of the necessity of committing thyself, and then, O\nRobert. thou canst return and complacently inform the disappointed\nparty that the result would have been far different had not thou been\ncalled suddenly away. Thou canst thus preserve the friendship of all\nparties, and their votes are more essential to thee than the mere\nadoption of measures affecting the prosperity of thy people. When the\nrequirements of the people of thy city become too great for thee alone\nto administer to all their wants, the great family of Okons, the\nlineal descendants of the sea kings from the bogs of Tipperary, will\ncome to thy aid. Take friendly counsel with them, as to incur their\ndispleasure will mean thy downfall. Let all the ends thou aimest at be\nto so dispose of the offices within thy gift that the Okons, and the\nfollowers of the Okons, will be as fixed in their positions as are the\nstars in their orbits.\"\n\nAfter delivering this strange astrological exhortation the dusky\nmaiden slowly retreated toward the entrance of a nearby cavern, the\npaleface meandered forth to survey the ground of his future greatness\nand the voyageur resumed his lonely journey toward the setting sun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCHAPTER II.--A TERRIBLE REALITY.\n\n\nAfter the lapse of more than four score of years the voyageur from the\nfrigid North returned from his philanthropic visit to the red man. A\nwonderful change met the eye. A transformation as magnificent as it\nwas bewildering had occurred. The same grand old bluffs looked proudly\ndown upon the Father of Water. The same magnificent river pursued\nits unmolested course toward the boundless ocean. But all else had\nchanged. The hostile warrior no longer impeded the onward march of\ncivilization, and cultivated fields abounded on every side.\nSteamers were hourly traversing the translucent waters of the great\nMississippi; steam and electricity were carrying people with the\nrapidity of lightning in every direction; gigantic buildings appeared\non the earth's surface, visible in either direction as far as the\neye could reach; on every corner was a proud descendant of Erin's\nnobility, clad in gorgeous raiment, who had been branded \"St. Paul's\nfinest\" before leaving the shores of his native land. In the midst of\nthis great city was a magnificent building, erected by the generosity\nof its people, in which the paleface, supported on either side by the\nOkons, was the high and mighty ruler. The Okons and the followers of\nthe Okons were in possession of every office within the gift of the\npaleface. Floating proudly from the top of this great building was an\nimmense banner, on which was painted in monster letters the talismanic\nwords: \"For mayor, 1902, Robert A. Smith,\" Verily the prophecy of the\ndusky maiden had been fulfilled. The paleface had become impregnably\nintrenched. The Okons could never be dislodged.\n\nWith feelings of unutterable anguish at the omnipresence of the Okons,\nthe aged voyageur quietly retraced his footsteps and was never more\nseen by the helpless and overburdened subjects of the paleface.\n\n\n\n\nSPELLING DOWN A SCHOOL.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I was about twelve years of age I resided in a small village in\none of the mountainous and sparsely settled sections of the northern\npart of Pennsylvania.\n\nIt was before the advent of the railroad and telegraph in that\nlocality. The people were not blessed with prosperity as it is known\nto-day. Neither were they gifted with the intellectual attainments\npossessed by the inhabitants of the same locality at the present time.\nMany of the old men served in the war of 1812, and they were looked up\nto with about the same veneration as are the heroes of the Civil War\nto-day. It was at a time when the younger generation was beginning to\nacquire a thirst for knowledge, but it was not easily obtained under\nthe peculiar conditions existing at that period. A school district\nthat was able to support a school for six months in each year was\nindeed considered fortunate, but even in these the older children were\nnot permitted to attend during the summer months, as their services\nwere considered indispensable in the cultivation of the soil.\n\nReading, writing and arithmetic were about all the studies pursued in\nthose rural school districts, although occasionally some of the better\nclass of the country maidens could be seen listlessly glancing over a\ngeography or grammar, but they were regarded as \"stuck up,\" and the\nother pupils thought they were endeavoring to master something far\nbeyond their capacity.\n\nOur winter school term generally commenced the first week in December\nand lasted until the first week in March, with one evening set apart\neach week for a spelling-match and recitation. We had our spelling\nmatch on Saturday nights, and every four weeks we would meet with\nschools in other districts in a grand spelling contest. I was\nconsidered too young to participate in any of the joint spelling\nmatches, and my heart was heavy within me every time I saw a great\nfour-horse sleigh loaded with joyful boys and girls on their way to\none of the great contests.\n\nOne Saturday night there was to be a grand spelling match at a country\ncrossroad about four miles from our village, and four schools were to\nparticipate. As I saw the great sleigh loaded for the coming struggle\nthe thought occurred to me that if I only managed to secure a ride\nwithout being observed I might in some way be able to demonstrate to\nthe older scholars that in spelling at least I was their equal. While\nthe driver was making a final inspection of the team preparatory to\nstarting I managed to crawl under his seat, where I remained as quiet\nas mouse until the team arrived at the point of destination. I had not\nconsidered the question of getting back--I left that to chance. As\nsoon as the different schools had arrived two of the best spellers\nwere selected to choose sides, and it happened that neither of them\nwas from our school. I stood in front of the old-fashioned fire-place\nand eagerly watched the pupils as they took their places in the line.\nThey were drawn in the order of their reputation as spellers. When\nthey had finished calling the names I was still standing by the\nfireplace, and I thought my chance was hopeless. The school-master\nfrom our district noticed my woebegone appearance, and he arose from\nhis seat and said:\n\n\"That boy standing by the fireplace is one of the best spellers in our\nschool.\"\n\nMy name was then reluctantly called, and I took my place at the\nfoot of the column. I felt very grateful towards our master for his\ncompliment and I thought I would be able to hold my position in the\nline long enough to demonstrate that our master was correct. The\nschool-master from our district was selected to pronounce the words,\nand I inwardly rejoiced.\n\nAfter going down the line several times and a number of scholars had\nfallen on some simple word the school-master pronounced the word\n\"phthisic.\" My heart leaped as the word fell from the school-master's\nlips. It was one of my favorite hard words and was not in the spelling\nbook. It had been selected so as to floor the entire line in order to\nmake way for the exercises to follow.\n\nAs I looked over the long line of overgrown country boys and girls I\nfelt sure that none of them would be able to correctly spell the word.\n\"Next!\" \"Next!\" \"Next!\" said the school-master, and my pulse beat\nfaster and faster as the older scholars ahead of me were relegated to\ntheir seats.\n\nAt last the crucial time had come. I was the only one left standing.\nAs the school-master stood directly in front of me and said \"Next,\" I\ncould see by the twinkle in his eye that he thought I could correctly\nspell the word. My countenance had betrayed me. With a clear and\ndistinct voice loud enough to be heard by every one in the room\nI spelled out \"ph-th-is-ic--phthisic.\" \"Correct,\" said the\nschool-master, and all the scholars looked aghast at my promptness.\n\nI shall never forget the kindly smile of the old school-master, as he\nlaid the spelling book upon the teacher's desk, with the quiet remark:\n\"I told you he could spell.\" I had spelled down four schools, and my\nreputation as a speller was established. Our school was declared to\nhave furnished the champion speller of the four districts, and ever\nafter my name was not the last one to be called.\n\nOn my return home I was not compelled to ride under the driver's seat.\n\n\nHALF A CENTURY WITH THE PIONEER PRESS.\n\nPioneer Press, April 18, 1908:--Frank Moore, superintendent of the\ncomposing room if the Pioneer Press, celebrated yesterday the fiftieth\nanniversary of his connection with the paper. A dozen of the old\nemployes of the Pioneer Press entertained Mr. Moore at an informal\ndinner at Magee's to celebrate the unusual event. Mr. Moore's service\non the Pioneer Press, in fact, has been longer than the Pioneer\nPress itself, for he began his work on one of the newspapers which\neventually was merged into the present Pioneer Press. He has held his\npresent position as the head of the composing room for about forty\nyears.\n\nFrank Moore was fifteen years old when he came to St. Paul from Tioga\ncounty, Pa., where he was born. He came with his brother, George W.\nMoore, who was one of the owners and managers of the Minnesotian. His\nbrother had been East and brought the boy West with him. Mr. Moore's\nfirst view of newspaper work was on the trip up the river to St. Paul.\nThere had been a special election on a bond issue and on the way his\nbrother stopped at the various towns to got the election returns.\n\nMr. Moore went to work for the Minnesotian on April 17, 1858, as a\nprinter's \"devil.\" It is interesting in these days of water works and\ntelegraph to recall that among his duties was to carry water for the\noffice. He got it from a spring below where the Merchants hotel now\nstands. Another of his jobs was to meet the boats. Whenever a steamer\nwhistled Mr. Moore ran to the dock to get the bundle of newspapers the\nboat brought, and hurry with it back to the office. It was from these\npapers that the editors got the telegraph news of the world. He also\nwas half the carrier staff of the paper. His territory covered all\nthe city above Wabasha street, but as far as he went up the hill\nwas College avenue and Ramsey street was his limit out West Seventh\nstreet. There was no St. Paul worth mentioning beyond that.\n\nWhen the Press absorbed the Minnesotian in 1861, Mr. Moore went with\nit, and when in 1874 the Press and Pioneer were united Mr. Moore\nstayed with the merged paper. His service has been continuous,\nexcepting during his service as a volunteer in the Civil war. The\nPioneer Press, with its antecedents, has been his only interest.\n\nWhile Mr. Moore's service is notable for its length, it is still more\nnotable for the fact that he has grown with the paper, so that\nto-day at sixty-five he is still filling his important position as\nefficiently on a large modern newspaper as he filled it as a young man\nwhen things in the Northwest, including its newspapers, were in the\nbeginning. Successive managements found that his services always gave\nfull value and recognized in him an employe of unusual loyalty and\ndevotion to the interests of the paper. Successive generations of\nemployes have found him always just the kind of man it is a pleasure\nto have as a fellow workman.\n\n\n\n***"}, {"short_book_title": "Dragon's blood by Henry Milner Rideout", "publication_date": 1909, "url": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10321", "text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, Sjaani and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\n\n\n\n\nDRAGON'S BLOOD\n\nby\n\nHENRY MILNER RIDEOUT\n\nwith illustrations by HAROLD M.

They sat on the coolest corner in\nPort Said, their table commanding both the cross-way of Chareh Sultan el\nOsman, and the short, glaring vista of desert dust and starved young\nacacias which led to the black hulks of shipping in the Canal. From the\nBar la Poste came orchestral strains--\"Ai nostri monti\"--performed by a\npiano indoors and two violins on the pavement. The sounds contended with\na thin, scattered strumming of cafe mandolins, the tinkle of glasses,\nthe steady click of dominoes and backgammon; then were drowned in the\nharsh chatter of Arab coolies who, all grimed as black as Nubians, and\nshouldering spear-headed shovels, tramped inland, their long tunics\nstiff with coal-dust, like a band of chain-mailed Crusaders lately\ncaught in a hurricane of powdered charcoal. Athwart them, Parisian\ngowns floated past on stout Italian forms; hulking third-class\nAustralians, in shirtsleeves, slouched along toward their mail-boat,\nhugging whiskey bottles, baskets of oranges, baskets of dates; British\nsoldiers, khaki-clad for India, raced galloping donkeys through the\ncrowded and dusty street. It was mail-day, and gayety flowed among the\ntables, under the thin acacias, on a high tide of Amer Picon.\n\nThrough the inky files of the coaling-coolies burst an alien and\nbewildered figure. He passed unnoticed, except by the filthy little Arab\nbootblacks who swarmed about him, trotting, capering, yelping\ncheerfully: \"Mista Ferguson!--polish, finish!--can-can--see nice Frencha\ngirl--Mista McKenzie, Scotcha fella from Dublin--smotta picture--polish,\nfinish!\"--undertoned by a squabbling chorus. But presently, studying his\nface, they cried in a loud voice, \"Nix! Alles!\" and left him, as one not\ndesiring polish.\n\n\"German, that chap,\" drawled the captain of the Tsuen-Chau, lazily,\nnoticing the uncertain military walk of the young man's clumsy legs, his\nuncouth clothes, his pale visage winged by blushing ears of coral pink.\n\n\"The Eitel's in, then,\" replied Cesare. And they let the young Teuton\nvanish in the vision of mixed lives.\n\nDown the lane of music and chatter and drink he passed slowly, like a\nman just wakened,--assailed by Oriental noise and smells, jostled by the\nraces of all latitudes and longitudes, surrounded and solitary, unheeded\nand self-conscious. With a villager's awkwardness among crowds, he made\nhis way to a German shipping-office.\n\n\"Dispatches for Rudolph Hackh?\" he inquired, twisting up his blond\nmoustache, and trying to look insolent and peremptory, like an\nemployer of men.\n\n\"There are none, sir,\" answered an amiable clerk, not at all impressed.\n\nAbashed once more in the polyglot street, still daunted by his first\nplunge into the foreign and the strange, he retraced his path, threading\nshyly toward the Quai Francois Joseph. He slipped through the barrier\ngate, signaled clumsily to a boatman, crawled under the drunken little\nawning of the dinghy, and steered a landsman's course along the shining\nCanal toward the black wall of a German mail-boat. Cramping the Arab's\noar along the iron side, he bumped the landing-stage. Safe on deck, he\nbecame in a moment stiff and haughty, greeting a fellow passenger here\nand there with a half-military salute. All afternoon he sat or walked\nalone, unapproachable, eyeing with a fierce and gloomy stare the\nsqualid front of wooden houses on the African side, the gray desert\nglare of Asia, the pale blue ribbon of the great Canal stretching\nsouthward into the unknown.\n\nHe composed melancholy German verses in a note-book. He recalled famous\nexiles--Camoens, Napoleon, Byron--and essayed to copy something of all\nthree in his attitude. He cherished the thought that he, clerk at\ntwenty-one, was now agent at twenty-two, and traveling toward a house\nwith servants, off there beyond the turn of the Canal, beyond the curve\nof the globe. But for all this, Rudolph Hackh felt young, homesick,\ntimid of the future, and already oppressed with the distance, the age,\nthe manifold, placid mystery of China.\n\nToward that mystery, meanwhile, the ship began to creep. Behind her,\nhouses, multi- funnels, scrubby trees, slowly swung to blot out\nthe glowing Mediterranean and the western hemisphere. Gray desert banks\nclosed in upon her strictly, slid gently astern, drawing with them to\nthe vanishing-point the bright lane of traversed water. She gained the\nBitter Lakes; and the red conical buoys, like beads a-stringing, slipped\non and added to the two converging dotted lines.\n\n\"Good-by to the West!\" thought Rudolph. As he mourned sentimentally at\nthis lengthening tally of their departure, and tried to quote\nappropriate farewells, he was deeply touched and pleased by the sadness\nof his emotions. \"Now what does Byron say?\"\n\nThe sombre glow of romantic sentiment faded, however, with the sunset.\nThat evening, as the ship glided from ruby coal to ruby coal of the\ngares, following at a steady six knots the theatric glare of her\nsearch-light along arsenically green cardboard banks, Rudolph paced the\ndeck in a mood much simpler and more honest. In vain he tried the\nhalf-baked philosophy of youth. It gave no comfort; and watching the\nclear desert stars of two mysterious continents, he fell prey to the\nunbounded and unintelligible complexity of man's world. His own career\nseemed no more dubious than trivial.\n\nSucceeding days only strengthened this mood. The Red Sea passed in a\ndream of homesickness, intolerable heat, of a pale blue surface\nstretched before aching eyes, and paler strips of pink and gray coast,\nfaint and distant. Like dreams, too, passed Aden and Colombo; and then,\nsuddenly, he woke to the most acute interest.\n\nHe had ignored his mess-mates at their second-class table; but when the\nnew passengers from Colombo came to dinner, he heard behind him the\nswish of stiff skirts, felt some one brush his shoulder, and saw,\nsliding into the next revolving chair, the vision of a lady in white.\n\n\"_Mahlzeit_\" she murmured dutifully. But the voice was not German.\nRudolph heard her subside with little flouncings, and felt his ears grow\nwarm and red. Delighted, embarrassed, he at last took sufficient courage\nto steal side-glances.\n\nThe first showed her to be young, fair-haired, and smartly attired in\nthe plainest and coolest of white; the second, not so young, but very\ncharming, with a demure downcast look, and a deft control of her spoon\nthat, to Rudolph's eyes, was splendidly fastidious; at the third, he was\nshocked to encounter the last flitting light of a counter-glance, from\nlarge, dark-blue eyes, not devoid of amusement.\n\n\"She laughs at me!\" fumed the young man, inwardly. He was angry,\nconscious of those unlucky wing-and-wing ears, vexed at his own\nboldness. \"I have been offensive. She laughs at me.\" He generalized from\nlong inexperience of a subject to which he had given acutely interested\nthought: \"They always do.\"\n\nAnger did not prevent him, however, from noting that his neighbor\ntraveled alone, that she must be an Englishwoman, and yet that she\ndiffused, somehow, an aura of the Far East and of romance. He shot many\na look toward her deck-chair that evening, and when she had gone below,\nstrategically bought a cigar, sat down in the chair to light it, and by\na carefully shielded match contrived to read the tag that fluttered on\nthe arm: \"B. Forrester, Hongkong.\"\n\nAfterward he remembered that by early daylight he might have read it for\nnothing; and so, for economic penance, smoked to the bitter end, finding\nthe cigar disagreeable but manly. At all events, homesickness had\nvanished in a curious impatience for the morrow. Miss Forrester: he\nwould sit beside Miss Forrester at table. If only they both were\ntraveling first-class!--then she might be a great lady. To be enamored\nof a countess, now--A cigar, after all, was the proper companion of\nbold thoughts.\n\nAt breakfast, recalling her amusement, he remained silent and wooden. At\ntiffin his heart leaped.\n\n\"You speak English, I'm sure, don't you?\" Miss Forrester was saying, in\na pleasant, rather drawling voice. Her eyes were quite serious now, and\nindeed friendly. Confusion seized him.\n\n\"I have less English to amuse myself with the ladies,\" he answered\nwildly. Next moment, however, he regained that painful mastery of the\ntongue which had won his promotion as agent, and stammered: \"Pardon. I\nwould mean, I speak so badly as not to entertain her.\"\n\n\"Indeed, you speak very nicely,\" she rejoined, with such a smile as no\nwoman had ever troubled to bestow on him. \"That will be so pleasant,\nfor my German is shocking.\"\n\nDazed by the compliment, by her manner of taking for granted that future\nconversation which had seemed too good to come true, but above all by\nher arch, provoking smile, Rudolph sat with his head in a whirl, feeling\nthat the wide eyes of all the second-cabiners were penetrating the\ntumultuous secret of his breast. Again his English deserted, and left\nhim stammering. But Miss Forrester chatted steadily, appeared to\nunderstand murmurs which he himself found obscure, and so restored his\nconfidence that before tiffin was over he talked no less gayly, his\nhonest face alight and glowing. She taught him the names of the strange\nfruits before them; but though listening and questioning eagerly, he\ncould not afterward have told loquat from pumelo, or custard-apple\nfrom papaya.\n\nNor could this young man, of methodical habits, ever have told how long\ntheir voyage lasted. It passed, unreal and timeless, in a glorious mist,\na delighted fever: the background a blur of glossy white bulkheads and\niron rails, awnings that fluttered in the warm, languorous winds, an\ninfinite tropic ocean poignantly blue; the foreground, Miss Forrester.\nHer white figure, trim and dashing; her round blue eyes, filled with coy\nwonder, the arch innocence of a spoiled child; her pale, smooth cheeks,\nrather plump, but coming oddly and enticingly to a point at the mouth\nand tilted chin; her lips, somewhat too full, too red, but quick and\nwhimsical: he saw these all, and these only, in a bright focus,\nlistening meanwhile to a voice by turns languid and lively, with now and\nthen a curious liquid softness, perhaps insincere, yet dangerously\npleasant. Questioning, hinting, she played at motherly age and wisdom.\nAs for him, he never before knew how well he could talk, or how\nengrossing his sober life, both in his native village on the Baltic and\nafterward in Bremen, could prove to either himself or a stranger.\n\nYet he was not such a fool, he reflected, as to tell everything. So far\nfrom trading confidences, she had told him only that she was bound\nstraight on to Hongkong; that curiosity alone had led her to travel\nsecond-class, \"for the delightful change, you know, from all such\nformality\"; and that she was \"really more French than English.\" Her\nreticence had the charm of an incognito; and taking this leaf from her\nbook, he gave himself out as a large, vaguely important person\njourneying on a large, vague errand.\n\n\"But you are a griffin?\" she had said, as they sat together at tea.\n\n\"Pardon?\" he ventured, wary and alarmed, wondering whether he could\nclaim this unknown term as in character with his part.\n\n\"I mean,\" Miss Forrester explained, smiling, \"it is your first visit to\nthe Far East?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he replied eagerly, blushing. He would have given worlds to\nsay, \"No.\"\n\n\"Griffins are such nice little monsters,\" she purred. \"I like them.\"\n\nSometimes at night, waked by the snores of a fat Prussian in the upper\nberth, he lay staring into the dark, while the ship throbbed in unison\nwith his excited thoughts. He was amazed at his happy recklessness. He\nwould never see her again; he was hurrying toward lonely and uncertain\nshores; yet this brief voyage outvalued the rest of his life.\n\nIn time, they had left Penang,--another unheeded background for her\narch, innocent, appealing face,--and forged down the Strait of Malacca\nin a flood of nebulous moonlight. It was the last night out from\nSingapore. That veiled brightness, as they leaned on the rail, showed\nher brown hair fluttering dimly, her face pale, half real, half magical,\nher eyes dark and undefined pools of mystery. It was late; they had been\nsilent for a long time; and Rudolph felt that something beyond the\nterritory of words remained to be said, and that the one brilliant epoch\nof his life now drew madly to a close.\n\n\"What do you think of it all?\" the woman asked suddenly, gravely, as\nthough they had been isolated together in the deep spaces of the\nsame thought.\n\n\"I do not yet--Of what?\" rejoined Rudolph, at a loss.\n\n\"Of all this.\" She waved an eloquent little gesture toward the\nazure-lighted gulf.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Of the world?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered slowly. \"The world. Life.\" Her tone, subdued and\nmusical, conveyed in the mere words their full enigma and full meaning.\n\"All this that we see.\"\n\n\"Who can tell?\" He took her seriously, and ransacked all his store of\nsecond-hand philosophy for a worthy answer,--a musty store, dead and\npedantic, after the thrilling spirit of her words. \"Why, I think--it\nis--is it not all now the sense-manifest substance of our duty? Pardon.\nI am obscure. '_Das versinnlichte Material unserer Pflicht_' No?\"\n\nHer clear laughter startled him.\n\n\"Oh, how moral!\" she cried. \"What a highly moral little griffin!\"\n\nShe laughed again (but this time it was like the splash of water in a\ndeep well), and turned toward him that curiously tilted point of chin\nand mouth, her eyes shadowy and mocking. She looked young again,--the\nspirit of youth, of knowledge, of wonderful brightness and unbelief.\n\n\"Must we take it so very, very hard?\" she coaxed. \"Isn't it just a place\nto be happy in?\"\n\nAs through a tumult he heard, and recognized the wisdom of the ages.\n\n\"Because,\" she added, \"it lasts such a little while--\"\n\nOn the rail their hands suddenly touched. He was aware of nothing but\nthe nearness and pallor of her face, the darkness of her eyes shining up\nat him. All his life seemed to have rushed concentrating into that one\ninstant of extreme trouble, happiness, trembling fascination.\n\nFootsteps sounded on the deck behind them; an unwelcome voice called\njocosely:--\n\n\"Good efening!\" The ship's doctor advanced with a roguish, paternal air.\n\"You see at the phosphor, not?\"\n\nEven as she whipped about toward the light, Rudolph had seen, with a\ntouch of wonder, how her face changed from a bitter frown to the most\nfriendly smile. The frown returned, became almost savage, when the fat\nphysician continued:--\n\n\"To see the phosphor is too much moon, Mrs. Forrester?\"\n\nHad the steamer crashed upon a reef, he would hardly have noticed such a\nminor shipwreck. Mrs. Forrester? why, then--When the doctor, after\nponderous pleasantries, had waddled away aft, Rudolph turned upon her a\nface of tragedy.\n\n\"Was that true?\" he demanded grimly.\n\n\"Was what true?\" she asked, with baby eyes of wonder, which no longer\ndeceived, but angered.\n\n\"What the doctor said.\" Rudolph's voice trembled. \"The tittle--the title\nhe gave you.\"\n\n\"Why, of course,\" she laughed.\n\n\"And you did not tell me!\" he began, with scorn.\n\n\"Don't be foolish,\" she cut in. From beneath her skirt the toe of a\nsmall white shoe tapped the deck angrily. Of a sudden she laughed, and\nraised a tantalizing face, merry, candid, and inscrutable. \"Why, you\nnever asked me, and--and of course I thought you were saying it all\nalong. You have such a dear, funny way of pronouncing, you know.\"\n\nHe hesitated, almost believing; then, with a desperate gesture, wheeled\nand marched resolutely aft. That night it was no Prussian snores which\nkept him awake and wretched. \"Everything is finished,\" he thought\nabysmally. He lay overthrown, aching, crushed, as though pinned under\nthe fallen walls of his youth.\n\nAt breakfast-time, the ship lay still beside a quay where mad crowds of\nbrown and yellow men, scarfed, swathed, and turbaned in riotous colors,\nworked quarreling with harsh cries, in unspeakable interweaving uproar.\nThe air, hot and steamy, smelled of strange earth. As Rudolph followed a\nMalay porter toward the gang-plank, he was painfully aware that Mrs.\nForrester had turned from the rail and stood waiting in his path.\n\n\"Without saying good-by?\" she reproached him. The injured wonder in her\neyes he thought a little overdone.\n\n\"Good-by.\" He could not halt, but, raising his cap stiffly, managed to\nadd, \"A pleasant voyage,\" and passed on, feeling as though she had\nmurdered something.\n\nHe found himself jogging in a rickshaw, while equatorial rain beat like\ndown-pouring bullets on the tarpaulin hood, and sluiced the Chinaman's\noily yellow back. Over the heavy-muscled shoulders he caught glimpses of\nsullen green foliage, ponderous and drooping; of half-naked barbarians\nthat squatted in the shallow caverns of shops; innumerable faces, black,\nyellow, white, and brown, whirling past, beneath other tarpaulin hoods,\nor at carriage windows, or shielded by enormous dripping wicker hats, or\nbared to the pelting rain. Curious odors greeted him, as of sour\nvegetables and of unknown rank substances burning. He stared like a\nvisionary at the streaming multitude of alien shapes.\n\nThe coolie swerved, stopped, tilted his shafts to the ground. Rudolph\nentered a sombre, mouldy office, where the darkness rang with tiny\nsilver bells. Pig-tailed men in skull-caps, their faces calm as polished\nivory, were counting dollars endlessly over flying finger-tips. One of\nthese men paused long enough to give him a sealed dispatch,--the message\nto which the ocean-bed, the Midgard ooze, had thrilled beneath his\ntardy keel.\n\n\"Zimmerman recalled,\" the interpretation ran; \"take his station; proceed\nat once.\"\n\nHe knew the port only as forlorn and insignificant. It did not matter.\nOne consolation remained: he would never see her again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nTHE PIED PIPER\n\nA gray smudge trailing northward showed where the Fa-Hien--Scottish\nOriental, sixteen hundred tons--was disappearing from the pale expanse\nof ocean. The sampan drifted landward imperceptibly, seeming, with\nnut-brown sail unstirred, to remain where the impatient steamer had met\nit, dropped a solitary passenger overside, and cast him loose upon the\nbreadth of the antipodes. Rare and far, the sails of junks patched the\nhorizon with umber polygons. Rudolph, sitting among his boxes in the\nsampan, viewed by turns this desolate void astern and the more desolate\nsweep of coast ahead. His matting sail divided the shining bronze\noutpour of an invisible river, divided a low brown shore beyond, and\nabove these, the strips of some higher desert country that shone like\nsnowdrifts, or like sifted ashes from which the hills rose black and\ncharred. Their savage, winter-blasted look, in the clear light of an\nalmost vernal morning, made the land seem fabulous. Yet here in reality,\nthought Rudolph, as he floated toward that hoary kingdom,--here at last,\nfacing a lonely sea, reared the lifeless, inhospitable shore, the\nsullen margin of China.\n\nThe slow creaking of the spliced oar, swung in its lashing by a\nhalf-naked yellow man, his incomprehensible chatter with some fellow\nboatman hidden in the bows, were sounds lost in a drowsy silence,\nrhythms lost in a wide inertia. Time itself seemed stationary. Rudolph\nnodded, slept, and waking, found the afternoon sped, the hills gone, and\nhis clumsy, time-worn craft stealing close under a muddy bank topped\nwith brown weeds and grass. They had left behind the silted roadstead,\nand now, gliding on a gentle flood, entered the river-mouth. Here and\nthere, against the saffron tide, or under banks quaggy as melting\nchocolate, stooped a naked fisherman, who--swarthy as his background but\nfor a loin-band of yellow flesh--shone wet and glistening while he\nstirred a dip-net through the liquid mud. Faint in the distance harsh\ncries sounded now and then, and the soft popping of small-arms,--tiny\nrevolts in the reign of a stillness aged and formidable. Crumbling walls\nand squat ruins, black and green-patched with mould--old towers of\ndefense against pirates--guarded from either bank the turns of the\nriver. In one reach, a \"war-junk,\" her sails furled, lay at anchor, the\nred and white eyes staring fish-like from her black prow: a silly\nmonster, the painted tompions of her wooden cannon aiming drunkenly\naskew, her crew's wash fluttering peacefully in a line of blue dungaree.\n\nBeyond the next turn, a fowling-piece cracked sharply, close at hand;\nsomething splashed, and the ruffled body of a snipe bobbed in the bronze\nflood alongside.\n\n\"Hang it!\" complained a voice, loudly. \"The beggar was too--Hallo! Oh, I\nsay, Gilly! Gilly, ahoy! Pick us up, there's a good chap! The bird\nfirst, will you, and then me.\"\n\nA tall young man in brown holland and a battered _terai_ stood above on\nthe grassy brink.\n\n\"Oh, beg pardon,\" he continued. \"Took you for old Gilly, you know.\" He\nsnapped the empty shells from his gun, and blew into the breech, before\nadding, \"Would _you_ mind, then? That is, if you're bound up for\nStink-Chau. It's a beastly long tramp, and I've been shooting all\nafternoon.\"\n\nFollowed by three coolies who popped out of the grass with game-bags,\nthe young stranger descended, hopped nimbly from tussock to gunwale, and\nperched there to wash his boots in the river.\n\n\"Might have known you weren't old Gilly,\" he said over his shoulder.\n\"Wutzler said the Fa-Hien lay off signaling for sampan before breakfast.\nGoing to stay long?\"\n\n\"I am agent,\" answered Rudolph, with a touch of pride, \"for Fliegelman\nand Sons.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" drawled the hunter, lazily. He swung his legs inboard, faced\nabout, and studied Rudolph with embarrassing frankness. He was a\nlong-limbed young Englishman, whose cynical gray eyes, and thin face\ntinged rather sallow and Oriental, bespoke a reckless good humor. \"Life\nsentence, eh? Then your name's--what is it again?--Hackh, isn't it?\nHeywood's mine. So you take Zimmerman's place. He's off already, and\ngood riddance. He _was_ a bounder!--Charming spot you've come to! I\ndaresay if your Fliegelmans opened a hong in hell, you might possibly\nget a worse station.\"\n\nWithout change of manner, he uttered a few gabbling, barbaric words. A\ncoolie knelt, and with a rag began to clean the boots, which, from the\nexpression of young Mr. Heywood's face, were more interesting than the\narrival of a new manager from Germany.\n\n\"It will be dark before we're in,\" he said. \"My place for the night, of\ncourse, and let your predecessor's leavings stand over till daylight.\nAfter dinner we'll go to the club. Dinner! Chicken and rice, chicken and\nrice! Better like it, though, for you'll eat nothing else, term of\nyour life.\"\n\n\"You are very kind,\" began Rudolph; but this bewildering off-hand\nyoungster cut him short, with a laugh:--\n\n\"No fear, you'll pay me! Your firm supplies unlimited liquor. Much good\nthat ever did us, with old Zimmerman.\"\n\nThe sampan now slipped rapidly on the full flood, up a narrow channel\nthat the setting of the sun had turned, as at a blow, from copper to\nindigo. The shores passed, more and more obscure against a fading light.\nA star or two already shone faint in the lower spaces. A second war-junk\nloomed above them, with a ruddy fire in the stern lighting a glimpse of\nsquat forms and yellow goblin faces.\n\n\"It is very curious,\" said Rudolph, trying polite conversation, \"how\nthey paint so the eyes on their jonks.\"\n\n\"No eyes, no can see; no can see, no can walkee,\" chanted Heywood in\ncareless formula. \"I say,\" he complained suddenly, \"you're not going to\n'study the people,' and all that rot? We're already fed up with\nmissionaries. Their cant, I mean; no allusion to cannibalism.\"\n\nHe lighted a cigarette. After the blinding flare of the match, night\nseemed to have fallen instantaneously. As their boat crept on to the\nslow creaking sweep, both maintained silence, Rudolph rebuked and\nlonely, Heywood supine beneath a comfortable winking spark.\n\n\"What I mean is,\" drawled the hunter, \"we need all the good fellows we\ncan get. Bring any new songs out? Oh, I forgot, you're a German, too.--A\nsweet little colony! Gilly's the only gentleman in the whole half-dozen\nof us, and Heaven knows he's not up to much.--Ah, we're in. On our\nright, fellow sufferers, we see the blooming Village of Stinks.\"\n\nHe had risen in the gloom. Beyond his shadow a few feeble lights burned\nlow and scattered along the bank. Strange cries arose, the bumping of\nsampans, the mournful caterwauling of a stringed instrument.\n\n\"The native town's a bit above,\" he continued. \"We herd together here on\nthe edge. No concession, no bund, nothing.\"\n\nTheir sampan grounded softly in malodorous ooze. Each mounting the bare\nshoulders of a coolie, the two Europeans rode precariously to shore.\n\n\"My boys will fetch your boxes,\" called Heywood. \"Come on.\"\n\nThe path, sometimes marshy, sometimes hard-packed clay or stone flags\ndeeply littered, led them a winding course in the night. Now and then\nshapes met them and pattered past in single file, furtive and sinister.\nAt last, where a wall loomed white, Heywood stopped, and, kicking at a\nwooden gate, gave a sing-song cry. With rattling weights, the door\nswung open, and closed behind them heavily. A kind of empty garden, a\nbare little inclosure, shone dimly in the light that streamed from a\nlow, thick-set veranda at the farther end. Dogs flew at them, barking\noutrageously.\n\n\"Down, Chang! Down, Chutney!\" cried their master. \"Be quiet, Flounce,\nyou fool!\"\n\nOn the stone floor of the house, they leaped upon him, two red chows and\na fox-terrier bitch, knocking each other over in their joy.\n\n\"Olo she-dog he catchee plenty lats,\" piped a little Chinaman, who\nshuffled out from a side-room where lamplight showed an office desk.\n\"Too-day catchee. Plenty lats. No can.\"\n\n\"My compradore, Ah Pat,\" said Heywood to Rudolph. \"Ah Pat, my friend he\nb'long number one Flickleman, boss man.\"\n\nThe withered little creature bobbed in his blue robe, grinning at the\nintroduction.\n\n\"You welly high-tone man,\" he murmured amiably. \"Catchee goo' plice.\"\n\n\"All the same, I don't half like it,\" was Heywood's comment later. He\nhad led his guest upstairs into a bare white-washed room, furnished in\nwicker. Open windows admitted the damp sea breeze and a smell, like foul\ngun-barrels, from the river marshes. \"Where should all the rats be\ncoming from?\" He frowned, meditating on what Rudolph thought a trifle.\nAbove the sallow brown face, his chestnut hair shone oddly,\nclose-cropped and vigorous. \"Maskee, can't be helped.--O Boy, one\nsherry-bitters, one bamboo!\"\n\n\"To our better acquaintance,\" said Rudolph, as they raised their\nglasses.\n\n\"What? Oh, yes, thanks,\" the other laughed. \"Any one would know you for\na griffin here, Mr. Hackh. You've not forgotten your manners yet.\"\n\nWhen they had sat down to dinner in another white-washed room, and had\nundertaken the promised rice and chicken, he laughed again,\nsomewhat bitterly.\n\n\"Better acquaintance--no fear! You'll be so well acquainted with us all\nthat you'll wish you never clapped eyes on us.\" He drained his whiskey\nand soda, signaled for more, and added: \"Were you ever cooped up,\nyachting, with a chap you detested? That's the feeling you come to\nhave.--Here, stand by. You're drinking nothing.\"\n\nRudolph protested. Politeness had so far conquered habit, that he felt\nuncommonly flushed, genial, and giddy.\n\n\"That,\" urged Heywood, tapping the bottle, \"that's our only amusement.\nYou'll see. One good thing we can get is the liquor. 'Nisi damnose\nbibimus,'--forget how it runs: 'Drink hearty, or you'll die without\ngetting your revenge,'\"\n\n\"You are then a university's-man?\" cried Rudolph, with enthusiasm.\n\nThe other nodded gloomily. On the instant his face had fallen as\nimpassive as that of the Chinese boy who stood behind his chair,\nstraight, rigid, like a waxen image of Gravity in a blue gown.--\"Yes, of\nsorts. Young fool. Scrapes. Debt. Out to Orient. Same old story. More\ndebt. Trust the firm to encourage that! Debt and debt and debt. Tied up\nsafe. Transfer. Finish! Never go Home.\"--He rose with a laugh and an\nimpatient gesture.--\"Come on. Might as well take in the club as to sit\nhere talking rot.\"\n\nOutside the gate of the compound, coolies crouching round a lantern\nsprang upright and whipped a pair of sedan-chairs into position.\nHeywood, his feet elevated comfortably over the poles, swung in the\nlead; Rudolph followed, bobbing in the springy rhythm of the long\nbamboos. The lanterns danced before them down an open road, past a few\nblank walls and dark buildings, and soon halted before a whitened front,\nwhere light gleamed from the upper story.\n\n\"Mind the stairs,\" called Heywood. \"Narrow and beastly dark.\"\n\nAs they stumbled up the steep flight, Rudolph heard the click of\nbilliard balls. A pair of hanging lamps lighted the room into which he\nrose,--a low, gloomy loft, devoid of comfort. At the nearer table, a\nweazened little man bent eagerly over a pictorial paper; at the farther,\nchalking their cues, stood two players, one a sturdy Englishman with a\ngray moustache, the other a lithe, graceful person, whose blue coat,\nsmart as an officer's, and swarthy but handsome face made him at a\nglance the most striking figure in the room. A little Chinese imp in\nwhite, who acted as marker, turned on the new-comers a face of\npreternatural cunning.\n\n\"Mr. Wutzler,\" said Heywood. The weazened reader rose in a nervous\nflutter, underwent his introduction to Rudolph with as much bashful\nagony as a school-girl, mumbled a few words in German, and instantly\ntook refuge in his tattered _Graphic_. The players, however, advanced in\na more friendly fashion. The Englishman, whose name Rudolph did not\ncatch, shook his hand heartily.\n\n\"Mr. Hackh is a welcome addition.\" He spoke with deliberate courtesy.\nSomething in his voice, the tired look in his frank blue eyes and\nserious face, at once engaged respect. \"For our sakes,\" he continued,\n\"we're glad to see you here. I am sure Doctor Chantel will agree\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed,\" said the man in military blue, with a courtier's bow.\nBoth air and accent were French. \"Most welcome.\"\n\n\"Let's all have a drink,\" cried Heywood. Despite his many glasses at\ndinner, he spoke with the alacrity of a new idea. \"O Boy, whiskey\n_Ho-lan suey, fai di_!\"\n\nAway bounded the boy marker like a tennis-ball.\n\n\"Hello, Wutzler's off already!\"--The little old reader had quietly\ndisappeared, leaving them a vacant table.--\"Isn't he weird?\" laughed\nHeywood, as they sat down. \"Comes and goes like a ghost.\"\n\n\"It is his Chinese wife,\" declared Chantel, preening his moustache. \"He\nis always ashame to meet the new persons.\"\n\n\"Poor old chap,\" said Heywood. \"I know--feels himself an outcast and all\nthat. Humph! With us! Quite unnecessary.\"--The Chinese page, quick,\nsolemn, and noiseless, glided round the table with his tray.--\"Ah, you\nyoung devil! You're another weird one, you atom. See those bead eyes\nwatching us, eh? A Gilpin Homer, you are, and some fine day we'll see\nyou go off in a flash of fire. If you don't poison us all first.--Well,\nhere's fortune!\"\n\n\"Your health, Mr. Hackh,\" amended the other Englishman.\n\nAs they set down their glasses, a strange cry sounded from below,--a\nstifled call, inarticulate, but in such a key of distress that all four\nfaced about, and listened intently.\n\n\"Kom down,\" called a hesitating voice, \"kom down and look-see.\"\n\nThey sprang to the stairs, and clattered downward. Dim radiance flooded\nthe landing, from the street door. Outside, a smoky lantern on the\nground revealed the lower levels.\n\nIn the wide sector of light stood Wutzler, shrinking and apologetic,\nlike a man caught in a fault, his wrinkled face eloquent of fear, his\ngesture eloquent of excuse. Round him, as round a conjurer, scores of\nlittle shadowy things moved in a huddling dance, fitfully hopping like\nsparrows over spilt grain. Where the light fell brightest these became\nplainer, their eyes shone in jeweled points of color.\n\n\"By Jove, Gilly, they are rats!\" said Heywood, in a voice curiously\nforced and matter-of-fact. \"Flounce killed several this afternoon,\nso my--\"\n\nNo one heeded him; all stared. The rats, like beings of incantation,\nstole about with an absence of fear, a disregard of man's presence, that\nwas odious and alarming.\n\n\"Earthquake?\" The elder Englishman spoke as though afraid of disturbing\nsome one.\n\nThe French doctor shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he answered in the same tone. \"Look.\"\n\nThe rats, in all their weaving confusion, displayed one common impulse.\nThey sprang upward continually, with short, agonized leaps, like\ndrowning creatures struggling to keep afloat above some invisible flood.\nThe action, repeated multitudinously into the obscure background,\nexaggerated in the foreground by magnified shadows tossing and falling\non the white walls, suggested the influence of some evil stratum, some\nvapor subtle and diabolic, crawling poisonously along the ground.\n\nHeywood stamped angrily, without effect. Wutzler stood abject, a\nmagician impotent against his swarm of familiars. Gradually the rats,\nsilent and leaping, passed away into the darkness, as though they heard\nthe summons of a Pied Piper.\n\n\"It doesn't attack Europeans.\" Heywood still used that curious\ninflection.\n\n\"Then my brother Julien is still alive,\" retorted Doctor Chantel,\nbitterly.\n\n\"What do you think, Gilly?\" persisted Heywood.\n\nHis compatriot nodded in a meaningless way.\n\n\"The doctor's right, of course,\" he answered. \"I wish my wife weren't\ncoming back.\"\n\n\"Dey are a remember,\" ventured Wutzler, timidly. \"A warnung.\"\n\nThe others, as though it had been a point of custom, ignored him. All\nstared down, musing, at the vacant stones.\n\n\"Then the concert's off to-morrow night,\" mocked Heywood, with an\nunpleasant laugh.\n\n\"On the contrary.\" Gilly caught him up, prompt and decided. \"We shall\nneed all possible amusements; also to meet and plan our campaign.\nMeantime,--what do you say, Doctor?--chloride of lime in pots?\"\n\n\"That, evidently,\" smiled the handsome man. \"Yes, and charcoal burnt in\nbraziers, perhaps, as Pere Fenouil advises. Fumigate.\"--Satirical and\ndebonair, he shrugged his shoulders.--\"What use, among these thousands\nof yellow pigs?\"\n\n\"I wish she weren't coming,\" repeated Gilly.\n\nRudolph, left outside this conference, could bear the uncertainty no\nlonger.\n\n\"I am a new arrival,\" he confided to his young host. \"I do not\nunderstand. What is it?\"\n\n\"The plague, old chap,\" replied Heywood, curtly. \"These playful little\nanimals get first notice. You're not the only arrival to-night.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nUNDER FIRE\n\nThe desert was sometimes Gobi, sometimes Sahara, but always an infinite\nstretch of sand that floated up and up in a stifling layer, like the\ntide. Rudolph, desperately choked, continued leaping upward against an\ninsufferable power of gravity, or straining to run against the force of\nparalysis. The desert rang with phantom voices,--Chinese voices that\nmocked him, chanting of pestilence, intoning abhorrently in French.\n\nHe woke to find a knot of bed-clothes smothering him. To his first\nunspeakable relief succeeded the astonishment of hearing the voices\ncontinue in shrill chorus, the tones Chinese, the words, in louder\nfragments, unmistakably French. They sounded close at hand, discordant\nmatins sung by a mob of angry children. Once or twice a weary, fretful\nvoice scolded feebly: \"Un-peu-de-s'lence! Un-peu-de-s'lence!\" Rudolph\nrose to peep through the heavy jalousies, but saw nothing more than\nsullen daylight, a flood of vertical rain, and thin rivulets coursing\ndown a tiled roof below. The morning was dismally cold.\n\n\"Jolivet's kids wake you?\" Heywood, in a blue kimono, nodded from the\ndoorway. \"Public nuisance, that school. Quite needless, too. Some bally\nFrench theory, you know, sphere of influence, and that rot. Game played\nout up here, long ago, but they keep hanging on.--Bath's ready, when you\nlike.\" He broke out laughing. \"Did you climb into the water-jar,\nyesterday, before dinner? Boy reports it upset. You'll find the dipper\nmore handy.--How did you ever manage? One leg at a time?\"\n\nEchoes of glee followed his disappearance. Rudolph, blushing, prepared\nto descend into the gloomy vault of ablution. Charcoal fumes, however,\nand the glow of a brazier on the dark floor below, not only revived all\nhis old terror, but at the stair-head halted him with a new.\n\n\"Is the water safe?\" he called.\n\nHeywood answered impatiently from his bedroom.\n\n\"Nothing safe in this world, Mr. Hackh. User's risk.\" An inaudible\nmutter ended with, \"Keep clean, anyway.\"\n\nAt breakfast, though the acrid smoke was an enveloping reminder, he made\nthe only reference to their situation.\n\n\"Rain at last: too late, though, to flush out the gutters. We needed it\na month ago.--I say, Hackh, if you don't mind, you might as well cheer\nup. From now on, it's pure heads and tails. We're all under fire\ntogether.\" Glancing out of window at the murky sky, he added\nthoughtfully, \"One excellent side to living without hope, maskee\nfashion: one isn't specially afraid. I'll take you to your office, and\nyou can make a start. Nothing else to do, is there?\"\n\nDripping bearers and shrouded chairs received them on the lower floor,\ncarried them out into a chill rain that drummed overhead and splashed\nalong the compound path in silver points. The sunken flags in the road\nformed a narrow aqueduct that wavered down a lane of mire. A few\ngrotesque wretches, thatched about with bamboo matting, like bottles, or\nlike rosebushes in winter, trotted past shouldering twin baskets. The\nsmell of joss-sticks, fish, and sour betel, the subtle sweetness of\nopium, grew constantly stronger, blended with exhalations of ancient\nrefuse, and (as the chairs jogged past the club, past filthy groups\nhuddling about the well in a marketplace, and onward into the black yawn\nof the city gate) assailed the throat like a bad and lasting taste. Now,\nin the dusky street, pent narrowly by wet stone walls, night seemed to\nfall, while fresh waves of pungent odor overwhelmed and steeped the\nsenses. Rudolph's chair jostled through hundreds and hundreds of\nChinese, all alike in the darkness, who shuffled along before with\nswitching queues, or flattened against the wall to stare, almost nose\nto nose, at the passing foreigner. With chairpoles backing into one shop\nor running ahead into another, with raucous cries from the coolies, he\nswung round countless corners, bewildered in a dark, leprous, nightmare\nbazaar. Overhead, a slit of cloudy sky showed rarely; for the most part,\nhe swayed along indoors, beneath a dingy lattice roof. All points of the\ncompass vanished; all streets remained alike,--the same endless vista of\nmystic characters, red, black, and gold, on narrow suspended tablets,\nunder which flowed the same current of pig-tailed men in blue and dirty\nwhite. From every shop, the same yellow faces stared at him, the same\nelfin children caught his eye for a half-second to grin or grimace, the\nsame shaven foreheads bent over microscopical tasks in the dark. At\nfirst, Rudolph thought the city loud and brawling; but resolving this\nimpression to the hideous shouts of his coolies parting the crowd, he\ndetected, below or through their noise, from all the long\ncross-corridors a wide and appalling silence. Gradually, too, small\nsounds relieved this: the hammering of brass-work, the steady rattle of\na loom, or the sing-song call and mellow bell of some burdened hawker,\nbumping past, his swinging baskets filled with a pennyworth of trifles.\nBut still the silence daunted Rudolph in this astounding vision, this\nmasque of unreal life, of lost daylight, of annihilated direction, of\nplacid turmoil and multifarious identity, made credible only by the\npermanence of nauseous smells.\n\nSomewhere in the dark maze, the chairs halted, under a portal black and\nheavy as a Gate of Dreams. And as by the anachronism of dreams\nthere hung, among its tortuous symbols, the small, familiar\nplacard--\"Fliegelman and Sons, Office.\" Heywood led the way, past two\nducking Chinese clerks, into a sombre room, stone-floored, furnished\nstiffly with a row of carved chairs against the wall, lighted coldly by\nroof-windows of placuna, and a lamp smoking before some commercial god\nin his ebony and tinsel shrine.\n\n\"There,\" he said, bringing Rudolph to an inner chamber, or dark little\npent-house, where another draughty lamp flickered on a European desk.\n\"Here's your cell. I'm off--call for you later. Good luck!\"--Wheeling in\nthe doorway, he tossed a book, negligently.--\"Caught! You may as well\nstart in, eh?--'Cantonese Made Worse,'\"\n\nTo his departing steps Rudolph listened as a prisoner, condemned, might\nlisten to the last of all earthly visitors. Peering through a kind of\nbutler's window, he saw beyond the shrine his two pallid subordinates,\nlike mystic automatons, nodding and smoking by the doorway. Beyond\nthem, across a darker square like a cavern-mouth, flitted the living\nphantoms of the street. It seemed a fit setting for his fears. \"I am\nlost,\" he thought; lost among goblins, marooned in the age of barbarism,\nshut in a labyrinth with a Black Death at once actual and mediaeval: he\ndared not think of Home, but flung his arms on the littered desk, and\nburied his face.\n\nOn the tin pent-roof, the rain trampled inexorably.\n\nAt last, mustering a shaky resolution, he set to work ransacking the\ntumbled papers. Happily, Zimmerman had left all in confusion. The very\nhopelessness of his accounts proved a relief. Working at high tension,\nRudolph wrestled through disorder, mistakes, falsification; and little\nby little, as the sorted piles grew and his pen traveled faster, the old\nabsorbing love of method and dispatch--the stay, the cordial flagon of\ntroubled man--gave him strength to forget.\n\nAt times, felt shoes scuffed the stone floor without, and high, scolding\nvoices rose, exchanging unfathomable courtesy with his clerks. One after\nanother, strange figures, plump and portly in their  robes,\ncrossed his threshold, nodding their buttoned caps, clasping their hands\nhidden in voluminous sleeves.\n\n\"My 'long speakee my goo' flien',\" chanted each of these apparitions;\nand each, after a long, slow discourse that ended more darkly than it\nbegan, retired with fatuous nods and smirks of satisfaction, leaving\nRudolph dismayed by a sense of cryptic negotiation in which he had been\nfound wanting.\n\nNoon brought the only other interval, when two solemn \"boys\" stole in\nwith curry and beer. Eat he could not in this lazaret, but sipped a\nlittle of the dark Kirin brew, and plunged again into his researches.\nAlone with his lamp and rustling papers, he fought through perplexities,\nnow whispering, now silent, like a student rapt in some midnight fervor.\n\n\"What ho! Mustn't work this fashion!\" Heywood's voice woke him, sudden\nas a gust of sharp air. \"Makee finish!\"\n\nThe summons was both welcome and unwelcome; for as their chairs jostled\nhomeward through the reeking twilight, Rudolph felt the glow of work\nfade like the mockery of wine. The strange seizure returned,--exile,\ndanger, incomprehensibility, settled down upon him, cold and steady as\nthe rain. Tea, at Heywood's house, was followed by tobacco, tobacco by\nsherry, and this by a dinner from yesterday's game-bag. The two men said\nlittle, sitting dejected, as if by agreement. But when Heywood rose, he\nchanged into gayety as a man slips on a jacket.\n\n\"Now, then, for the masked ball! I mean, we can't carry these long\nfaces to the club, can we? Ladies' Night--what larks!\" He caught up his\ncap, with a grimace. \"The Lord loveth a cheerful liar. Come ahead!\"\n\nOn the way, he craned from his chair to shout, in the darkness:--\n\n\"I say! If you can do a turn of any sort, let the women have it. All the\nfun they get. Be an ass, like the rest of us. Maskee how silly! Mind\nyou, it's all hands, these concerts!\"\n\nNo music, but the click of ivory and murmur of voices came down the\nstairway of the club. At first glance, as Rudolph rose above the floor,\nthe gloomy white loft seemed vacant as ever; at second glance,\nembarrassingly full of Europeans. Four strangers grounded their cues\nlong enough to shake his hand. \"Mr. Nesbit,--Sturgeon--Herr\nKempner--Herr Teppich,\"--he bowed stiffly to each, ran the battery of\ntheir inspection, and found himself saluting three other persons at the\nend of the room, under a rosy, moon-bellied lantern. A gray matron,\nstout, and too tightly dressed for comfort, received him uneasily, a\ndark-eyed girl befriended him with a look and a quiet word, while a tall\nman, nodding a vigorous mop of silver hair, crushed his hand in a great\nbony fist.\n\n\"Mrs. Earle,\" Heywood was saying, \"Miss Drake, and--how are you,\npadre?--Dr. Earle.\"\n\n\"Good-evening,\" boomed the giant, in a deep and musical bass. \"We are\nvery glad, very glad.\" His voice vibrated through the room, without\neffort. It struck one with singular force, like the shrewd, kind\nbrightness of his eyes, light blue, and oddly benevolent, under brows\nhard as granite. \"Sit down, Mr. Hackh,\" he ordered genially, \"and give\nus news of the other world! I mean,\" he laughed, \"west of Suez.\nSmoking's allowed--here, try that!\"\n\nHe commanded them, as it were, to take their ease,--the women among\ncushions on a rattan couch, the men stretched in long chairs. He put\nquestions, indolent, friendly questions, opening vistas of reply and\nrecollection; so that Rudolph, answering, felt the first return of\nhomely comfort. A feeble return, however, and brief: in the pauses of\ntalk, misgiving swarmed in his mind, like the leaping vermin of last\nnight. The world into which he had been thrown still appeared\ndisorderly, incomprehensible, and dangerous. The plague--it still\nrecurred in his thoughts like a sombre motive; these friendly people\nwere still strangers; and for a moment now and then their talk, their\nsmiles, the click of billiards, the cool, commonplace behavior, seemed a\nfoolhardy unconcern, as of men smoking in a powder magazine.\n\n\"Clearing a bit, outside,\" called Nesbit. A little, wiry fellow, with\ncheerful Cockney speech, he stood chalking his cue at a window. \"I say,\nwhat's the matter one piecee picnic this week? Pink Pagoda, eh? Mrs.\nGilly's back, you know.\"\n\n\"No, is she?\" wheezed the fat Sturgeon, with something like enthusiasm.\n\"Now we'll brighten up! By Jove, that's good news. That's worth hearing.\nEh, Heywood?\"\n\n\"Rather!\" drawled Rudolph's friend, with an alacrity that seemed half\ncynical, half enigmatic.\n\nA quick tread mounted the stairs, and into the room rose Dr. Chantel. He\nbowed gracefully to the padre's group, but halted beside the players.\nWhatever he said, they forgot their game, and circled the table to\nlisten. He spoke earnestly, his hands fluttering in nervous gestures.\n\n\"Something's up,\" grumbled Heywood, \"when the doctor forgets to pose.\"\n\nBehind Chantel, as he wheeled, heaved the gray bullet-head and sturdy\nshoulders of Gilly.\n\n\"Alone?\" called the padre. \"Why, where's the Mem?\"\n\nHe came up with evident weariness, but replied cheerfully:--\n\n\"She's very sorry, and sent chin-chins all round. But to-night--Her\njourney, you know. She's resting.--I hope we've not delayed\nthe concert?\"\n\n\"Last man starts it!\" Heywood sprang up, flung open a battered piano,\nand dragged Chantel to the stool. \"Come, Gilly, your forfeit!\"\n\nThe elder man blushed, and coughed.\n\n\"Why, really,\" he stammered. \"Really, if you wish me to!\"\n\nHeywood slid back into his chair, grinning.\n\n\"Proud as an old peacock,\" he whispered to Rudolph. \"Peacock's voice,\ntoo.\"\n\nDr. Chantel struck a few jangling chords, and skipping adroitly over\nsick notes, ran a flourish. The billiard-players joined the circle, with\nabsent, serious faces. The singer cleared his throat, took on a\npreternatural solemnity, and began. In a dismal, gruff voice, he\nproclaimed himself a miner, deep, deep down:--\n\n\n\"And few, I trow, of my being know,\nAnd few that an atom care!\"\n\n\nHis hearers applauded this gloomy sentiment, till his cheeks flushed\nagain with honest satisfaction. But in the full sweep of a brilliant\ninterlude, Chantel suddenly broke down.\n\n\"I cannot,\" he declared sharply. As he turned on the squealing stool,\nthey saw his face white and strangely wrought. \"I had meant,\" he said,\nwith painful precision, \"to say nothing to-night, and act as--I cannot.\nJudge you, what I feel.\"\n\nHe got uncertainly to his feet, hesitating.\n\n\"Ladies, you will not be alarmed.\" The four players caught his eye, and\nnodded. \"It is well that you know. There is no danger here, more than--I\nam since disinfected. Monsieur Jolivet, my compatriot--You see, you\nunderstand. Yes, the plague.\"\n\nFor a space, the distant hum of the streets invaded the room. Then\nHeywood's book of music slapped the floor like a pistol-shot.\n\n\"You left him!\" He bounced from his chair, raging. \"You--Peng! Where's\nmy cap?\"\n\nQuick as he was, the dark-eyed girl stood blocking his way.\n\n\"Not you, Mr. Heywood,\" she said quietly. \"I must go stay with him.\"\n\nThey confronted each other, man and woman, as if for a combat of will.\nThe outbreak of voices was cut short; the whole company stood, like\nHomeric armies, watching two champions. Chantel, however, broke\nthe silence.\n\n\"Nobody must go.\" He eyed them all, gravely. \"I left him, yes. He does\nnot need any one. Personne. Very sudden. He went to the school sick this\nmorning. Swollen axillae--the poor fool, not to know!--et\npuis--enfin--He is dead.\"\n\nHeywood pitched his cap on the green field of the billiard-cloth.\n\n\"The poor pedagogue!\" he said bitterly. \"_He_ was going Home.\"\n\nSudden, hot and cold, like the thrust of a knife, it struck Rudolph that\nhe had heard the voice of this first victim,--the peevish voice which\ncried so weakly for a little silence, at early daylight, that very\nmorning. A little silence: and he had received the great.\n\nA gecko fell from the ceiling, with a tiny thump that made all start. He\nhad struck the piano, and the strings answered with a faint, aeolian\nconfusion. Then, as they regarded one another silently, a rustle, a\nflurry, sounded on the stairs. A woman stumbled into the loft, sobbing,\ncrying something inarticulate, as she ran blindly toward them, with\nwhite face and wild eyes. She halted abruptly, swayed as though to fall,\nand turned, rather by instinct than by vision, to the other women.\n\n\"Bertha!\" protested Gilly, with a helpless stare. \"My dear!\"\n\n\"I couldn't stay!\" she cried. \"The amah told me. Why did you ever let me\ncome back? Oh, do something--help me!\"\n\nThe face and the voice came to Rudolph like another trouble across a\ndream. He knew them, with a pang. This trembling, miserable heap, flung\ninto the arms of the dark-eyed girl, was Mrs. Forrester.\n\n\"Go on,\" said the girl, calmly. She had drawn the woman down beside her\non the rattan couch, and clasping her like a child, nodded toward the\npiano. \"Go on, as if the doctor hadn't--hadn't stopped.\"\n\nHeywood was first to obey.\n\n\"Come, Chantel, chantez! Here's your song.\" He took the stool in\nleap-frog fashion, and struck a droll simultaneous discord. \"Come on.--\nWell, then, catch me on the chorus!\"\n\n\n\"Pour qu' j' finisse\nMon service\nAu Tonkin je suis parti!\"\n\n\nTo a discreet set of verses, he rattled a bravado accompaniment.\nPresently Chantel moved to his side, and, with the same spirit, swung\ninto the chorus. The tumbled white figure on the couch clung to her\nrefuge, her bright hair shining below the girl's quiet, thoughtful face.\nShe was shaken with convulsive regularity.\n\nIn his riot of emotions, Rudolph found an over-mastering shame. A\npicture returned,--the Strait of Malacca, this woman in the blue\nmoonlight, a Mistress of Life, rejoicing, alluring,--who was now the\nsingle coward in the room. But was she? The question was quick and\nrevolting. As quickly, a choice of sides was forced on him. He\nunderstood these people, recalled Heywood's saying, and with that, some\nstory of a regiment which lay waiting in the open, and sang while the\nbullets picked and chose. All together: as now these half-dozen men\nwere roaring cheerfully:--\n\n\n\"Ma Tonkiki, ma Tonkiki, ma Tonkinoise,\nYen a d'autr's qui m' font les doux yeux,\nMais c'est ell' que j'aim' le mieux!\"\n\n\nThe new recruit joined them, awkwardly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nTHE SWORD-PEN\n\n\"Wutzler was missing last night,\" said Heywood, lazily. He had finished\nbreakfast, and lighted a short, fat, glossy pipe. \"Just occurred to me.\nWe must have a look in on him. Poor old Wutz, he's getting worse and\nworse. Chantel's right, I fancy: it's the native wife.\" He rose, with a\nshort laugh. \"Queer. The rest never feel so,--Nesbit, and Sturgeon, and\nthat lot. But then, they don't fall so low as to marry theirs.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" he sneered, on the landing, \"until this scare blows over,\nyou'd better postpone any such establishment, if you intend--\"\n\n\"I do not,\" stammered Rudolph.\n\nTo his amazement, the other clapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\"I say!\" The sallow face and cynical gray eyes lighted, for the first\ntime, with something like enthusiasm. Next moment they had darkened\nagain, but not before he had said gruffly, \"You're not a bad\nlittle chap.\"\n\nMorosely, as if ashamed of this outburst, he led the way through the\nbare, sunny compound, and when the gate had closed rattling behind\nthem, stated their plans concisely and sourly. \"No work to-day, not a\nstroke! We'll just make it a holiday, catchee good time.--What? No. Rot!\nI won't work, and you can't. That's all there is about that. Don't be an\nass! Come along. We'll go out first and see Captain Kneebone.\" And when\nRudolph, faithful to certain tradesmen snoring in Bremen, would have\nprotested mildly, he let fly a stinging retort, and did not regain his\ntemper until they had passed the outskirts of the village. Yet even the\nquarrel seemed part of some better understanding, some new, subtle bond\nbetween two lonely men.\n\nBefore them opened a broad field dotted with curious white disks, like\nbone buttons thrown on a green carpet. Near at hand, coolies trotted and\nstooped, laying out more of these circular baskets, filled with tiny\ndough-balls. Makers of rice-wine, said Heywood; as he strode along\nexplaining, he threw off his surly fit. The brilliant sunlight, the\nbreeze stirring toward them from a background of drooping bamboos, the\ngabble of coolies, the faint aroma of the fermenting _no-me_ cakes,\nbegan, after all, to give a truant sense of holiday.\n\nAlmost gayly, the companions threaded a marshy path to the river, and\nbargained with a shrewd, plump woman who squatted in the bow of a\nsampan. She chaffered angrily, then laughed at some unknown saying of\nHeywood's, and let them come aboard. Summoned by voluble scolding, her\nhusband appeared, and placidly labored at the creaking sweep. They\nslipped down a river of bronze, between the oozy banks; and the\nwar-junks, the naked fisherman, the green-coated ruins of forts, drifted\npast like things in reverie, while the men lay smoking, basking in\nbright weather. They looked up into serene spaces, and forgot the umbra\nof pestilence.\n\nHeywood, now lazy, now animated, exchanged barbaric words with the\nboat-woman. As their tones rose and fell, she laughed. Long afterward,\nRudolph was to remember her, a wholesome, capable figure in faded blue,\ndarting keen glances from her beady eyes, flashing her white teeth in a\nsmile, or laughing till the green pendants of false jade trembled in\nher ears.\n\n\"Her name is Mrs. Wu,\" said Heywood, between smoke-rings, \"and she is a\nlady of humor. We are discussing the latest lawsuit, which she describes\nas suing a flea and winning the bite. Her maiden name was the Pretty\nLily. She is captain of this sampan, and fears that her husband does not\nrate A. B.\"\n\nWhere the river disembogued, the Pretty Lily, cursing and shrilling,\npattering barefoot about her craft, set a matting sail and caught the\nbreeze. Over the copper surface of the roadstead, the sampan drew out\nhandily. Ahead, a black, disreputable little steamer lay anchored, her\nname--two enormous hieroglyphics painted amidships--staring a bilious\nyellow in the morning sun. Under these, at last, the sampan came\nbumping, unperceived or neglected.\n\nOverhead, a pair of white shoes protruded from the rail in a blue film\nof smoke. They twitched, as a dry cackle of laughter broke out.\n\n\"Kut Sing, ahoy!\" shouted Heywood. \"On deck! Kneebone!\"\n\nThe shoes whipped inboard. Outboard popped a ruddy little face, set in\nthe green circle of a _topi_, and contorted with laughter.\n\n\"Listen to this, will ye!\" cried the apparition, as though illustrating\na point. Leaning his white sleeves on the rail, cigar in one fist,\nTauchnitz volume in the other, he roared down over the side a passage of\nprose, from which his visitors caught only the words \"Ginger Dick\" and\n\"Peter Russet,\" before mirth strangled him.\n\n\"God bless a man,\" he cried, choking, \"that can make a lonesome old\nbeggar laugh, out here! Eh, what? How he ever thinks up--But he's took\nto writing plays, they tell me. Plays!\" He scowled ferociously. \"Fat lot\no' good they are, for skippers, and planters, and gory exiles! Eh, what?\nBe-george, I'll write him a chit! _I'll_ tell him! Plays be damned; we\nwant more stories!\"\n\nRed and savage, he hurled the book fluttering into the sea, then swore\nin consternation.\n\n\"Oh, I say!\" he wailed. \"Fish her out! I've not finished her. My\nintention was, ye know, to fling the bloomin' cigar!\"\n\nHeywood, laughing, rescued the volume on a long bamboo.\n\n\"Just came out on the look-see, captain,\" he called up. \"Can't board\nyou. Plague ashore.\"\n\n\"Plague be 'anged!\" scoffed the little captain. \"That hole's no worse\nwith plague than't is without. Got two cases on board, myself--coolies.\nStowed 'em topside, under the boats.--Come up here, ye castaway! Come\nup, ye goatskin Robinson Crusoe, and get a white man's chow!\"\n\nHe received them on deck,--a red, peppery little officer, whose shaven\ncheeks and close gray hair gave him the look of a parson gone wrong, a\nhedge-priest run away to sea. Two tall Chinese boys scurried about with\nwicker chairs, with trays of bottles, ice, and cheroots, while he barked\nhis orders, like a fox-terrier commanding a pair of solemn dock-rats.\nThe white men soon lounged beside the wheel-house.\n\n\"So you brought Mrs. Forrester,\" drawled Heywood.\n\nRudolph, wondering if they saw him wince, listened with painful\neagerness. But the captain disposed of that subject very simply.\n\n\"_She's_ no good.\" He stared up at the grimy awning. \"What I'm thinking\nis, will that there Dacca babu at Koprah slip me through his blessed\nquarantine for twenty-five dollars. What?\"\n\nTheir talk drifted far away from Rudolph, far from China itself, to\ntouch a hundred ports and islands, Cebu and Sourabaya, Tavoy and\nSelangor. They talked of men and women, a death at Zamboanga, a birth at\nChittagong, of obscure heroism or suicide, and fortunes made or lost;\nwhile the two boys, gentle, melancholy, gliding silent in bright blue\nrobes, spread a white tablecloth, clamped it with shining brass, and\nlaid the tiffin. Then the talk flowed on, the feast made a tiny clatter\nof jollity in the slumbering noon, in the silence of an ocean and a\ncontinent. And when at last the visitors clambered down the iron side,\nthey went victorious with Spanish wine.\n\n\"Mind ye,\" shouted Captain Kneebone, from the rail, \"that don't half\nexhaust the subjeck o' lott'ries! Why, luck\"--He shook both fists aloft,\ntriumphantly, as if they had been full of money. \"Just ye wait. I've a\ntip from Calcutta that--Never mind. Bar sells, when that fortch'n comes,\nmy boy, the half's yours! Home we go, remember that!\"\n\nThe sampan drew away. Sweeping his arm violently, to threaten the coast\nof China and the whole range of his vision,--\n\n\"You're the one man,\" he roared, \"that makes all this mess--worth a\ncowrie!\"\n\nHeywood laughed, waved his helmet, and when at last he turned, sat\nlooking downward with a queer smile.\n\n\"Illusions!\" he chuckled. \"What would a chap ever do without 'em? Old\nKneebone there: his was always that--a fortune in a lottery, and then\nHome! Illusions! And he's no fool, either. Good navigator. Decent old\nbeggar.\" He waved his helmet again, before stretching out to sleep. \"Do\nyou know, I believe--he _would_ take me.\"\n\nThe clinkered hills, quivering in the west, sank gradually into the\nheated blur above the plains. As gradually, the two men sank\ninto dreams.\n\nFurious, metallic cries from the Pretty Lily woke them, in the blue\ntwilight. She had moored her sampan alongside a flight of stone steps,\nup which, vigorously, with a bamboo, she now prodded her husband. He\ncontended, snarling, but mounted; and when Heywood's silver fell\njingling into her palm, lighted his lantern and scuffed along, a\nchurlish guide. At the head of the slimy stairs, Heywood rattled a\nponderous gate in a wall, and shouted. Some one came running, shot\nbolts, and swung the door inward. The lantern showed the tawny, grinning\nface of a servant, as they passed into a small garden, of dwarf orange\ntrees pent in by a lofty, whitewashed wall.\n\n\"These grounds are yours, Hackh,\" said Heywood. \"Your predecessor's boy;\nand there\"--pointing to a lonely barrack that loomed white over the\nstunted grove--\"there's your house. You draw the largest in the station.\nA Portuguese nunnery, it was, built years ago. My boys are helping set\nit to rights; but if you don't mind, I'd like you to stay on at my\nbeastly hut until this--this business takes a turn. Plenty of time.\" He\nnodded at the fat little orange trees. \"We may live to take our chow\nunder those yet, of an evening. Also a drink. Eh?\"\n\nThe lantern skipped before them across the garden, through a penitential\ncourtyard, and under a vaulted way to the main door and the road. With\nRudolph, the obscure garden and echoing house left a sense of magical\nownership, sudden and fleeting, like riches in the Arabian Nights. The\nroad, leaving on the right a low hill, or convex field, that heaved\nagainst the lower stars, now led the wanderers down a lane of hovels,\namong dim squares of smoky lamplight.\n\nWu, their lantern-bearer, had turned back, and they had begun to pass a\nfew quiet, expectant shops, when a screaming voice, ahead, outraged the\nevening stillness.\n\nAt the first words, Heywood doubled his pace.\n\n\"Come along. Here's a lark--or a tragedy.\"\n\nJostling through a malodorous crowd that blockaded the quarrel, they\ngained the threshold of a lighted shop. Against a rank of orderly\nshelves, a fat merchant stood at bay, silent, quick-eyed, apprehensive.\nBefore him, like an actor in a mad scene, a sobbing ruffian, naked to\nthe waist, convulsed with passion, brandished wild fists and ranted with\nincredible sounds. When breath failed, he staggered, gasping, and swept\nhis audience with the glazed, unmeaning stare of drink or lunacy. The\nmerchant spoke up, timid and deprecating. As though the words were\nvitriol, the other started, whirled face to face, and was seized with a\nnew raving.\n\nSomething protruded at his waistband, like a rudimentary, Darwinian\nstump. To this, all at once, his hand flung back. With a wrench and a\nglitter, he flourished a blade above his head. Heywood sprang to\nintervene, in the same instant that the disturber of trade swept his arm\ndown in frenzy. Against his own body, hilt and fist thumped home, with\nthe sound as of a football lightly punted. He turned, with a freezing\nlook of surprise, plucked at the haft, made one step calmly and\ntentatively toward the door, stumbled, and lay retching and coughing.\n\nThe fat shop-keeper wailed like a man beside himself. He gabbled,\nimploring Heywood. The young man nodded. \"Yes, yes,\" he repeated\nirritably, staring down at the body, but listening to the stream\nof words.\n\nMurmurs had risen, among the goblin faces blinking in the doorway.\nBehind them, a sudden voice called out two words which were caught up\nand echoed harshly in the street. Heywood whipped about.\n\n\"Never called me that before,\" he said quickly. \"Come outside.\"\n\nHe flung back a hurried sentence to the merchant, caught Rudolph's arm,\nand plunged into the crowd. The yellow men gave passage mechanically,\nbut with lowering faces. Once free in the muddy path, he halted quickly,\nand looked about.\n\n\"Might have known,\" he grumbled. \"Never called me 'Foreign Dog' before,\nor 'Jesus man,' He set 'em on.\"\n\nRudolph followed his look. In the dim light, at the outskirts of the\nrabble, a man was turning away, with an air of contempt or unconcern.\nThe long, pale, oval face, the hard eyes gleaming with thought, had\nvanished at a glance. A tall, slight figure, stooping in his long robe,\nhe glided into the darkness. For all his haste, the gait was not the\ngait of a coolie.\n\n\"That,\" said Heywood, turning into their former path, \"that was Fang,\nthe Sword-Pen, so-called. Very clever chap. Of the two most dangerous\nmen in the district, he's one.\" They had swung along briskly for several\nminutes, before he added: \"The other most dangerous man--you've met him\nalready. If I'm not mistaken, he's no less a person than the Reverend\nJames Earle.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Rudolph, in dull bewilderment.\n\n\"Yes,\" grunted his friend. \"The padre. We must find him to-night, and\nreport.\"\n\nHe strode forward, with no more comment. At his side, Rudolph moved as a\nsoldier, carried onward by pressure and automatic rhythm, moves in the\napathy of a forced march. The day had been so real, so wholesome, full\nof careless talk and of sunlight. And now this senseless picture blotted\nall else, and remained,--each outline sharper in memory, the smoky lamp\nbrighter, the blow of the hilt louder, the smell of peanut oil more\npungent. The episode, to him, was a disconnected, unnecessary fragment,\none bloody strand in the whole terrifying snarl. But his companion\nstalked on in silence, like a man who saw a pattern in the web of\nthings, and was not pleased.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nIN TOWN\n\nNight, in that maze of alleys, was but a more sinister day. The same\nslant-eyed men, in broken files, went scuffing over filthy stone, like\nwanderers lost in a tunnel. The same inexplicable noises endured, the\nsame smells. Under lamps, the shaven foreheads still bent toward\nmicroscopic labor. The curtained window of a fantan shop still glowed in\norange translucency, and from behind it came the murmur and the endless\nchinking of cash, where Fortune, a bedraggled, trade-fallen goddess,\nsplit hairs with coolies for poverty or zero. Nothing was altered in\nthese teeming galleries, except that turbid daylight had imperceptibly\ngiven place to this other dimness, in which lanterns swung like tethered\nfire-balloons. Life went on, mysteriously, without change or sleep.\n\nWhile the two white men shouldered their way along, a strange chorus\nbroke out, as though from among the crowded carcasses in a butcher's\nstall. Shrill voices rose in unearthly discord, but the rhythm was\nnot of Asia.\n\n\"There goes the hymn!\" scoffed Heywood. He halted where, between the\nbutcher's and a book-shop, the song poured loud through an open doorway.\nNodding at a placard, he added: \"Here we are: 'Jesus Religion Chapel.'\nHear 'em yanging! 'There is a gate that stands ajar.' That being the\ncase, in you go!\"\n\nEntering a long, narrow room, lighted from sconces at either side, they\nsat down together, like schoolmates, on a low form near the door. From a\ndais across at the further end, the vigorous white head of Dr. Earle\ndominated the company,--a strange company, of lounging Chinamen who\nsucked at enormous bamboo pipes, or squinted aimlessly at the vertical\ninscriptions on the walls, or wriggling about, stared at the\nlate-comers, nudged their neighbors, and pointed, with guttural\nexclamations. The song had ended, and the padre was lifting up his\ngiant's voice. To Rudolph, the words had been mere sound and fury, but\nfor a compelling honesty that needed no translation. This man was not\npreaching to heathen, but talking to men. His eyes had the look of one\nwho speaks earnestly of matters close at hand, direct, and simple. Along\nthe forms, another and another man forgot to plait his queue, or squirm,\nor suck laboriously at his pipe. They listened, stupid or intent. When\nsome waif from the outer labyrinth scuffed in, affable, impudent,\nhailing his friends across the room, he made but a ripple of unrest,\nand sank gaping among the others like a fish in a pool.\n\nEven Heywood sat listening--with more attention than respect, for once\nhe muttered, \"Rot!\" Toward the close, however, he leaned across and\nwhispered, \"The old boy reels it off rather well to-night. Different to\nwhat one imagined.\"\n\nRudolph, for his part, sat watching and listening, surprised by a new\nand curious thought.\n\nA band of huddled converts sang once more, in squealing discords, with\nan air of sad, compulsory, and diabolic sarcasm. A few \"inquirers\"\nslouched forward, and surrounding the tall preacher, questioned him\nconcerning the new faith. The last, a broad, misshapen fellow with\nhanging jowls, was answered sharply. He stood arguing, received another\nsnub, and went out bawling and threatening, with the contorted face and\nclumsy flourishes of some fabulous hero on a screen.\n\nThe missionary approached smiling, but like a man who has finished the\nday's work.\n\n\"That fellow--Good-evening: and welcome to our Street Chapel, Mr.\nHackh--That fellow,\" he glanced after the retreating figure, \"he's a\nlesson in perseverance, gentlemen. A merchant, well-to-do: he has a\nlawsuit coming on--notorious--and tries to join us for protection.\nCheaper to buy a little belief, you know, than to pay Yamen fines.\nEvery night he turns up, grinning and bland. I tell him it won't do, and\nout he goes, snorting like a dragon.\"\n\nRudolph's impulse came to a head.\n\n\"Dr. Earle,\" he stammered, \"I owe you a gratitude. You spoke to these\npeople so--as--I do not know. But I listened, I felt--Before always are\nthey devils, images! And after I hear you, they are as men.\"\n\nThe other shook his great head like a silver mane, and laughed.\n\n\"My dear young man,\" he replied, \"they're remarkably like you and me.\"\n\nAfter a pause, he added soberly:--\n\n\"Images? Yes, you're right, sir. So was Adam. The same clay, the same\nimage.\" His deep voice altered, his eyes lighted shrewdly, as he turned\nto Heywood. \"This is an unexpected pleasure.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said the young man, readily. \"If you don't mind, padre, you\nmade Number One talk. Fast bowling, and no wides. But we really came for\nsomething else.\" In a few brief sentences, he pictured the death in the\nshop.--So, like winking! The beggar gave himself the iron, fell down,\nand made finish. Now what I pieced out, from his own bukhing, and the\nmerchant's, was this:--\n\n\"The dead man was one Au-yoeng, a cormorant-fisher. Some of his best\nbirds died, he had a long run of bad luck, and came near starving. So he\ncontrived, rather cleverly, to steal about a hundred catties of Fuh-kien\nhemp. The owner, this merchant, went to the elders of Au-yoeng's\nneighborhood, who found and restored the hemp, nearly all. Merchant lets\nthe matter drop. But the neighbors kept after this cormorant fellow,\nworked one beastly squeeze or another, ingenious baiting, devilish--Rot!\nyou know their neighborhoods better than I! Well, they pushed him\ndown-hill--poor devil, showing that's always possible, no bottom! He\nbrooded, and all that, till he thought the merchant and the Jesus\nreligion were the cause of all. So bang he goes down the\npole,--gloriously drunk,--marches into his enemy's shop, and uses that\nknife. The joke is now on the merchant, eh?\"\n\n\"Just a moment,\" begged the padre. \"One thread I don't follow--the\nreligion. Who was Christian? The merchant?\"\n\n\"Well, rather! Thought I told you,\" said Heywood. \"One of yours--big,\nmild chap--Chok Chung.\"\n\nThe elder man sat musing.\n\n\"Yes,\" the deep bass rumbled in the empty chapel, \"he's one of us.\nExtremely honest. I'm--I'm very sorry. There may be trouble.\"\n\n\"Must be, sir,\" prompted the younger. \"The mob, meanwhile, just stood\nthere, dumb,--mutes and audience, you know. All at once, the hindmost\nbegan squalling 'Foreign Dog,' 'Goat Man.' We stepped outside, and\nthere, passing, if you like, was that gentle bookworm, Mr. Fang.\"\n\n\"Fang?\" echoed the padre, as in doubt. \"I've heard the name.\"\n\n\"Heard? Why, doctor,\" cried Heywood, \"that long, pale chap,--lives over\ntoward the Dragon Spring. Confucian, very strict; keen reader; might be\na mandarin, but prefers the country gentleman sort; bally\nmischief-maker, he's done more people in the eye than all the Yamen\nhacks and all their false witnesses together! Hence his nickname--the\nSword-Pen.\"\n\nDr. Earle sharpened his heavy brows, and studied the floor.\n\n\"Fang, the Sword-Pen,\" he growled; \"yes, there will be trouble. He hates\nus. Given this chance--Humph! Saul of Tarsus.--We're not the Roman\nChurch,\" he added, with his first trace of irritation. \"Always\noccurring, this thing.\"\n\nOnce more he meditated; then heaved his big shoulders to let slip the\nwhole burden.\n\n\"One day at a time,\" he laughed. \"Thank you for telling us.--You see,\nMr. Hackh, they're not devils. The only fault is, they're just human\nbeings. You don't speak the language? I'll send you my old teacher.\"\n\nThey talked of things indifferent; and when the young men were stumbling\nalong the streets, he called after them a resounding \"Good-night!\nThanks!\"--and stood a resolute, gigantic silhouette, filling, as a right\nDoone filled their doorframe, the entrance to his deserted chapel.\n\nAt his gate, felt Rudolph, they had unloaded some weight of\nresponsibility. He had not only accepted it, but lightened them further,\ngirt them, by a word and a look. Somehow, for the first time since\nlanding, Rudolph perceived that through this difficult, troubled,\nignorant present, a man might burrow toward a future gleam. The feeling\nwas but momentary. As for Heywood, he still marched on grimly, threading\nthe stuffed corridors like a man with a purpose.\n\n\"No dinner!\" he snapped. \"Catchee bymby, though. We must see Wutzler\nfirst. To lose sight of any man for twenty-four hours, nowadays,--Well,\nit's not hardly fair. Is it?\"\n\nThey turned down a black lane, carpeted with dry rubbish. At long\nintervals, a lantern guttering above a door showed them a hand's-breadth\nof the dirty path, a litter of broken withes and basket-weavers' refuse,\nbetween the mouldy wall of the town and a row of huts, no less black and\nsilent. In this greasy rift the air lay thick, as though smeared into\na groove.\n\nSuddenly, among the hovels, they groped along a checkered surface of\nbrick-work. The flare of Heywood's match revealed a heavy wooden door,\nwhich he hammered with his fist. After a time, a disgruntled voice\nwithin snarled something in the vernacular. Heywood laughed.\n\n\"Ai-yah! Who's afraid? Wutzler, you old pirate, open up!\"\n\nA bar clattered down, the door swung back, and there, raising a\nglow-worm lantern of oiled paper, stood such a timorous little figure as\nmight have ventured out from a masquerade of gnomes. The wrinkled face\nwas Wutzler's, but his weazened body was lost in the glossy black folds\nof a native jacket, and below the patched trousers, his bare ankles and\ncoolie-sandals of straw moved uneasily, as though trying to hide behind\neach other.\n\n\"Kom in,\" said this hybrid, with a nervous cackle. \"I thought you are\nthiefs. Kom in.\"\n\nFollowing through a toy courtyard, among shadow hints of pigmy shrubs\nand rockery, they found themselves cramped in a bare, clean cell,\nlighted by a European lamp, but smelling of soy and Asiatics. Stiff\nblack-wood chairs lined the walls. A distorted landscape on rice-paper,\nnarrow scarlet panels inscribed with black cursive characters, pith\nflowers from Amoy, made blots of brightness.\n\n\"It iss not moch, gentlemen,\" sighed Wutzler, cringing. \"But I am ver'\nglad.\"\n\nHeywood flung himself into a chair.\n\n\"Not dead yet, you rascal?\" he cried. \"And we came all the way to see\nyou. No chow, either.\"\n\n\"Oh, allow me,\" mumbled their host, in a flutter. \"My--she--I will\nspeak, I go bring you.\" He shuffled away, into some further chamber.\n\nHeywood leaned forward quickly.\n\n\"Eat it,\" he whispered, \"whether you can or not! Pleases the old one, no\nbounds. We're his only visitors--\"\n\n\"Here iss not moch whiskey.\" Wutzler came shambling in, held a bottle\nagainst the light, and squinted ruefully at the yellow dregs. \"I will\ngif you a _kong_ full, but I haf not.\"\n\nHe dodged out again. They heard his angry whispers, and a small\ncommotion of the household,--brazen dishes clinking, squeals, titters,\nand tiny bare feet skipping about,--all the flurry of a rabbit-hutch in\nWonderland. Once, near the threshold, a chubby face, very pale, with\nround eyes of shining jet, peered cautious as a mouse, and popped out of\nsight with a squeak. Wutzler, red with excitement, came and went like an\nanxious waiter, bringing in the feast.\n\n\"Here iss not moch,\" he repeated sadly. But there were bits of pig-skin\nstewed in oil; bean-cakes; steaming buns of wheat-flour, stuffed with\ndice of fat pork and lumps of sugar; three-cornered rice puddings,\n_no-me_ boiled in plantain-leaf wrappers; with the last of the whiskey,\nin green cups. While the two men ate, the shriveled outcast beamed\ntimidly, hovering about them, fidgeting.\n\n\"Herr Hackh,\" he suddenly exclaimed, in a queer, strained voice, \"you do\nnot know how dis yong man iss goot! No! He hass to me--_immer_--\" He\nchoked, turned away, and began fussing with the pith flowers; but not\nbefore Rudolph had seen a line glistening down the sun-dried cheeks.\n\n\"Stuff! Cadging for chow, does one acquire merit?\" retorted Heywood,\nover his shoulder. \"You talk like a bonze, Wutz.\" He winked. \"I'd rather\nhear the sing-song box.\"\n\n\"_Ach so_, I forget!\" Still whimpering, Wutzler dragged something from a\ncorner, squatted, and jerked at a crank, with a noise of ratchets. \"She\nblay not so moch now,\" he snuffled. \"Captain Kneepone he has gifen her,\nwhen she iss all op inside for him. I haf rebaired, but she blay only\none song yet. A man does not know, Herr Hackh, what he may be. Once I\nhaf piano, and viola my own, yes, and now haf I diss small, laffing,\nsick teufel!\" He rose, and faced Heywood with a trembling, passionate\ngesture. \"But diss yong man, he stand by der oldt fellow!\" The streaming\neyes blinked absurdly.\n\nBehind him, with a whirring sound, a metallic voice assailed them in a\ngabble of words, at first husky and broken, then clear, nasal, a voice\nfrom neither Europe nor Asia, but America:--\n\n\n\"Then did I laff?\nOoh, aha-ha ha ha,\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha!\nI could not help but laffing,\nOoh, aha-ha ...\"\n\n\nFrom a throat of tin, it mocked them insanely with squealing,\nblack-hearted guffaws. Heywood sat smoking, with the countenance of a\nstoic; but when the laughter in the box was silent, he started abruptly.\n\n\"We're off, old chap,\" he announced. \"Bedtime. Just came to see you were\nall up-standing. Tough as ever? Good! Don't let--er--anything carry\nyou off.\"\n\nAt the gate, Wutzler held aloft his glow-worm lantern.\n\n\"Dose fellows catch me?\" he mumbled, \"Der plagues--dey will forget me.\nAll zo many shoots, _kugel_, der bullet,--'_gilt's mir, oder gilt es\ndir?_' Men are dead in der Silk-Weafer Street. Dey haf hong up nets, and\ndorns, to keep out der plague's-goblins off deir house. Listen, now, dey\nbeat gongs!--But we are white men. You--you tell me zo, to-night!\" He\nblubbered something incoherent, but as the gate slammed they heard the\nname of God, in a broken benediction.\n\nThey had groped out of the cleft, and into a main corridor, before\nHeywood paused.\n\n\"That devil in the box!\" He shook himself like a spaniel. \"Queer it\nshould get into me so. But I hate being laughed at by--anybody.\"\n\nA confused thunder of gongs, the clash of cymbals smothered in the\ndistance, maintained a throbbing uproar, pierced now and then by savage\nyells, prolonged and melancholy. As the two wanderers listened,--\n\n\"Where's the comfort,\" said Heywood, gloomily, \"of knowing somebody's\nworse off?--No, I wasn't thinking of Wutzler, then. Talk of germs! why,\nover there, it's goblins they're scaring away. Think, behind their nets\nand thorns, what wretches--women, too, and kids--may be crouched down,\nquaking, sick with terror. Humph!--I don't mind saying\"--for a moment\nhis hand lay on Rudolph's shoulder--\"that I loathe giving this muck-hole\nthe satisfaction--I'd hate to go Out here, that's all.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nTHE PAGODA\n\nHe was spared that inconvenience. The untimely rain and cold, some\npersons said, the few days of untimely heat following, had drowned or\ndried, frozen or burnt out, the seeds of peril. But accounts varied,\nreasons were plentiful. Soldiers had come down from the chow city,\ntwo-score _li_ inland, and charging through the streets, hacking and\nslashing the infested air, had driven the goblins over the walls, with a\ngreat shout of victory. A priest had freighted a kite with all the evil,\nthen cut it adrift in the sky. A mob had dethroned the God of Sickness,\nand banished his effigy in a paper junk, launched on the river at night,\nin flame. A geomancer proclaimed that a bamboo grove behind the town\nformed an angle most correct, germane, and pleasant to the Azure Dragon\nand the White Tiger, whose occult currents, male and female, run\nthroughout Nature. For any or all of these reasons, the town was\ndelivered. The pestilence vanished, as though it had come but to grant\nMonsieur Jolivet his silence, and to add a few score uncounted living\nwretches to the dark, mighty, imponderable host of ancestors.\n\nThe relief, after dragging days of uncertainty, came to Rudolph like a\nsea-breeze to a stoker. To escape and survive,--the bare experience\nseemed to him at first an act of merit, the deed of a veteran. The\ninterim had been packed with incongruity. There had been a dinner with\nKempner, solemn, full of patriotism and philosophy; a drunken dinner at\nTeppich's; another, and a worse, at Nesbit's; and the banquet of a\nnative merchant, which began at four o'clock on melon-seeds, tea, black\nyearling eggs, and a hot towel, and ended at three in the morning on\nrice-brandy and betel served by unreal women with chalked faces and\nvermilion-spotted lips, simpering and melancholy. By day, there was\nwork, or now and then a lesson with Dr. Earle's teacher, a little aged\nChinaman of intricate, refined, and plaintive courtesy. Under his\nguidance Rudolph learned rapidly, taking to study as a prodigal might\ntake to drink. And with increasing knowledge came increasing\ntranquillity; as when he found that the hideous cry, startling him at\nevery dawn, was the signal not for massacre, but buffalo-milk.\n\nThen, too, came the mild excitement of moving into his own house, the\nPortuguese nunnery. Through its desolate, lime-coated spaces, his meagre\nbelongings were scattered all too easily; but the new servants, their\nwords and ways, not only kept his hands full, but gave strange food for\nthought. The silent evenings, timed by the plash of a frog in a pool, a\ncry from the river, or the sing-song of a \"boy\" improvising some endless\nballad below-stairs; drowsy noons above the little courtyard, bare and\npeaceful as a jail; homesick moments at the window, when beyond the\nstunted orangery, at sunset, the river was struck amazingly from bronze\nto indigo, or at dawn flashed from pearl-gray to flowing brass;--all\nthese, and nights between sleep and waking, when fancy peopled the\nechoing chambers with the visionary lives, now ended, of meek, brown\nsisters from Goa or Macao, gave to Rudolph intimations, vague, profound,\nand gravely happy, as of some former existence almost recaptured. Once\nmore he felt himself a householder in the Arabian tales.\n\nAnd yet, when his life was growing all but placid, across it shot some\ntremor of disquieting knowledge.\n\nOne evening, after a busy day among his piece-goods, he had walked\nafield with Heywood, and back by an aimless circuit through the\ntwilight. His companion had been taciturn, of late; and they halted,\nwithout speaking, where a wide pool gleamed toward a black, fantastic\nbelt of knotted willows and sharp-curving roofs. Through these broke the\nshadow of a small pagoda, jagged as a war-club of shark's teeth. Vesper\ncymbals clashed faintly in a temple, and from its open door the first\nplummet of lamplight began to fathom the dark margin. A short bridge\ncurved high, like a camel's hump, over the glimmering half-circle of a\nsingle arch. Close by, under a drooping foreground of branches, a stake\nupheld an oblong placard of neat symbols, like a cartouche to explain\na painting.\n\n\"It is very beautiful,\" ventured Rudolph, twisting up his blond\nmoustache with satisfaction. \"Very sightly. I would say--picturesque, no?\"\n\n\"Very,\" said Heywood, absently. \"Willow Pattern.\"\n\n\"And the placard, so finishing, so artistic--That says?\"\n\n\"Eh, what? Oh, I wasn't listening.\" Heywood glanced carelessly at the\nupright sentence. That's a notice:--\n\n\"'Girls May Not be Drowned in This Pond.'\"\n\nHe started on, without comment. Without reply, Rudolph followed,\ngathering as he walked the force of this tremendous hint. Slow,\nfar-reaching, it poisoned the elegiac beauty of the scene, alienated the\nnight, and gave to the fading country-side a yet more ancient look,\nsombre and implacable. He was still pondering this, when across their\nwinding foot-path, with a quick thud of hoofs, swept a pair of\nequestrian silhouettes. It was half glimpse, half conjecture,--the tough\nlittle ponies trotting stubbornly, a rider who leaned across laughing,\nand a woman who gayly cried at him: \"You really do understand me, don't\nyou?\" The two jogging shadows melted in the bamboo tracery, like things\nblown down the wind. But for years Rudolph had known the words, the\nlaugh, the beguiling cadence, and could have told what poise of the head\nwent with them, what dangerous glancing light. Suddenly, without reason,\nhe felt a gust of rage. It was he that understood. It was to him these\nthings belonged. The memory of her weakness was lost in the shining\nmemory of her power. He should be riding there, in the dusk of this\nlonely and cruel land.\n\nHeywood had thrown after them a single gloomy stare, down the pointed\naisle of bamboos.\n\n\"Well matched!\" he growled. \"Chantel--He bounds in the saddle, and he\nbounds afoot!\"\n\nRudolph knew that he had hated Chantel at sight.\n\nHe could not bring himself, next day, to join their party for tiffin at\nthe Flowery Pagoda. But in the midst of his brooding, Teppich and the\nfat Sturgeon assailed the nunnery gate with pot-valiant blows and\nshouts. They had brought chairs, to carry him off; and being in no mood\nto fail, though panting and struggling, they packed him into a\npalanquin with many bottles of the best wine known to Fliegelman and\nSons. By a short cut through the streets--where checkered sunshine,\nthrough the lattice roof, gave a muddy, subdued light as in a roiled\naquarium--the revelers passed the inland wall. Here, in the shade,\ngrooms awaited them with ponies; and scrambling into saddle, they\ntrotted off through gaps in the bamboos, across a softly rolling\ncountry. Tortuous foot-paths of vivid pink wound over brilliant green\nterraces of young paddy. The pink crescents of new graves scarred the\nhillsides, already scalloped and crinkled with shelving abodes of the\nvenerable dead. Great hats of farmers stooping in the fields, gleamed in\nthe sun like shields of brass. Over knolls and through hollows the\nlittle cavalcade jogged steadily, till, mounting a gentle eminence, they\nwound through a grove of camphor and Flame-of-the-Forest. Above the\nbranches rose the faded lilac shaft of an ancient pagoda, ruinously\nadorned with young trees and wild shrubs clinging in the cornices.\n\nAt the foot of this aged fantasy in stone, people were laughing. The\nthree riders broke cover in time to see Mrs. Forrester, flushed and\nradiant, end some narrative with a droll pantomime. She stood laughing,\nthe life and centre of a delighted group.\n\n\"And Gilbert Forrester,\" she cried, turning archly on her husband,\n\"said that wasn't funny!\"\n\nGilly tugged his gray moustache, in high good-nature. Chantel, Nesbit,\nand Kempner laughed uproariously, the padre and the dark-eyed Miss Drake\nquietly, Heywood more quietly, while even stout, uneasy Mrs. Earle\nsmiled as in duty bound. A squad of Chinese boys, busy with\ntiffin-baskets, found time to grin. To this lively actress in the white\ngown they formed a sylvan audience under the gnarled boughs and\nthe pagoda.\n\n\"Too late!\" called the white-haired giant, indulgently, to the\ndismounting trio. \"Mr. Hackh, you should have come spurring.\"\n\nRudolph advanced, pale, but with a calmness of which, afterward, he was\njustly proud. The heroine of the moment turned toward him quickly, with\na look more natural, more sincere, than she had ever given him.\n\n\"Is this Mr. Hackh?\" she said graciously. \"I've heard so much about\nyou!\"\n\nThe young man himself was almost deceived. Was there a German mail-boat?\nWas there a club, from which he had stolen out while she wept,\nignominiously, in that girl's arms? And then of a sudden he perceived,\nwith a fatuous pleasure, how well she knew him, to know that he had\nnever spoken. His English, as he drew up a stool beside Miss Drake, was\nwild and ragged; but he found her an astonishing refuge. For the first\ntime, he recalled that this quiet girl had been beautiful, the other\nnight; and though now by day that beauty was rather of line than of\ncolor, he could not understand how it had been overlooked. Tiffin,\nmeanwhile, sped by like an orgy. He remembered asking so many questions,\nabout the mission hospital and her school for orphans, that the girl\nbegan at last to answer with constraint, and with puzzled, sidelong\nscrutiny. He remembered how even the tolerant Heywood shot a questioning\nglance toward his wine-glass. He remembered telling a brilliant story,\nand reciting \"Old Captain Mau in Vegesack,\"--rhymes long forgotten, now\nfluent and spontaneous. The applause was a triumph. Through it, as\nthrough a haze, he saw a pair of wide blue eyes shining with startled\nadmiration.\n\nBut the best came when the sun had lowered behind the grove, the company\ngrown more silent, and Mrs. Forrester, leaning beside the door of the\ntower, turned the great pegs of a Chinese lute. The notes tinkled like a\nmandolin, but with now and then an alien wail, a lament unknown to the\nWest. \"Sing for us,\" begged the dark-eyed girl; \"a native song.\" The\nother smiled, and bending forward as if to recollect, began in a low\nvoice, somewhat veiled, but musical and full of meaning. \"The Jasmine\nFlower,\" first; then, \"My Love is Gathering Dolichos\"; and then she\nsang the long Ballad of the Rice,--of the husband and wife planting side\nby side, the springing of the green blades, the harvest by millions upon\nmillions of sheaves, the wealth of the State, more fragrant to ancestors\nthan offerings of spice:--\n\n\n\"...O Labor and Love and hallowed Land!\nThink you these things are but still to come?\nThink you they are but near at hand,\nOnly now and here?--Behold.\nThey were the same in years of old!\"\n\n\nIn her plaintive interlude, the slant-eyed servants watched her, nodding\nand muttering under the camphor trees.\n\n\"And here's a song of exile,\" she said. \"I render it very\nbadly.\"--Rudolph had never seen her face like this, bending intently\nabove the lute. It was as though in the music she found and disclosed\nherself, without guile.\n\n\n\"...Blue was the sky,\nAnd blue the rice-pool water lay\nHolding the sky;\nBlue was the robe she wore that day.\nAlas, my sorrow! Why\nMust life bear all away,\nAway, away,\nAh, my beloved, why?\"\n\n\nA murmur of praise went round the group, as she put aside the\ninstrument.\n\n\"The sun's getting low,\" she said lightly, \"and I _must_ see that view\nfrom the top.\" Chantel was rising, but sat down again with a scowl, as\nshe turned to Rudolph. \"You've never seen it, Mr. Hackh? Do come help\nme up.\"\n\nInside, with echoing steps, they mounted in a squalid well, obscurely\nlighted from the upper windows, toward which decaying stairs rose in a\ndangerous spiral, without guard-rail. A misstep being no trifle, Rudolph\noffered his hand for the mere safety; but she took it with a curious\nlittle laugh. They climbed cautiously. Once, at a halt, she stood very\nclose, with eyes shining large in the dusk. Her slight body trembled,\nher head shook with stifled merriment, like a girl overcome by mischief.\n\n\"What a queer little world!\" she whispered. \"You and I here!--I never\ndreamed you could be funny. It made me so proud of you, down there!\"\n\nHe muttered something vague; and--the stairs ending in ruin at the\nfourth story--handed her carefully through the window to a small outer\nbalustrade. As they stood together at the rail, he knew not whether to\nbe angry, suspicious, or glad.\n\n\"I love this prospect,\" she began quietly. \"That's why I wanted you to\ncome.\"\n\nBeyond the camphors, a wide, strange landscape glowed in the full,\nlow-streaming light. The ocean lay a sapphire band in the east; in the\nwest, on a long ridge, undulated the gray battlements of a city, the\nantique walls, warmed and glorified, breasting the flood of sunset. All\nbetween lay vernal fields and hillocks, maidenhair sprays of bamboo, and\na wandering pattern of pink foot-paths. Slowly along one of these, a\nbright-gowned merchant rode a white pony, his bells tinkling in the\nstillness of sea and land. Everywhere, like other bells more tiny and\nshrill, sounded the trilling of frogs.\n\nAs the two on the pagoda stood listening,--\n\n\"It was before Rome,\" she declared thoughtfully. \"Before Egypt, and has\nnever changed. You and I are just--\" She broke off, humming:--\n\n\n\"Only here and now? Behold\nThey were the same in years of old!\"\n\n\nHer mood  the scene: the aged continuity of life oppressed him.\nYet he chose rather to watch the straggling battlements, far off, than\nto meet her eyes or see her hair gleaming in the sun. Through many\ntroubled days he had forgotten her, despised her, bound his heart in\ntriple brass against a future in her hateful neighborhood; and now,\nbeside her at this time-worn rail, he was in danger of being happy. It\nwas inglorious. He tried to frown.\n\n\"You poor boy.\" Suddenly, with an impulse that must have been generous,\nshe rested her hand on his arm. \"I was sorry. I thought of you\nso often.\"\n\nAt these close quarters, her tremulous voice and searching upward glance\nmeant that she alone understood all his troubles. He started, turned for\nsome rush of overwhelming speech, when a head popped through the window\nbehind them.\n\n\"Boot and saddle, Mrs. Forrester,\" announced Heywood. His lean young\nface was very droll and knowing. \"We're leaving, bottom-side.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much, Maurice,\" she answered, perhaps dryly. \"You're a\ndear, to climb all those dreadful stairs.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Heywood, with his gray eyes fastened on Rudolph, \"no\ntrouble.\"\n\nAll three went down the dark well together.\n\nWhen the company were mounted, and trooping downhill through the camphor\nshadow, Heywood's pony came sidling against Rudolph's, till legging\nchafed legging.\n\n\"You blossomed, old boy,\" he whispered. \"Quite the star, after your\ncomedy turn.\" He reined aside, grinning. \"What price sympathy on\na pagoda?\"\n\nFor that moment, Rudolph could have struck down the one sure friend he\nhad in China.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nIPHIGENIA\n\n\"Don't chop off a hen's head with a battle-axe.\" Heywood, still with a\nmalicious, friendly quirk at the corners of his mouth, held in his\nfretful pony. Rudolph stood bending a whip viciously. They two had\nfetched a compass about the town, and now in the twilight were parting\nbefore the nunnery gate. \"A tiff's the last thing I'd want with you. The\nlady, in confidence, is not worth--\"\n\n\"I do not wish,\" declared Rudolph, trembling,--\"I do not wish you to say\nthose things, so!\"\n\n\"Right!\" laughed the other, and his pony wheeled at the word. \"I'll give\nyou one month--no: you're such a good, thorough little chap, it will\ntake longer--two months, to change your mind. Only\"--he looked down at\nRudolph with a comic, elderly air--\"let me observe, our yellow people\nhave that rather neat proverb. A hen's head, dear chap,--not with a\nbattle-axe! No. Hot weather's coming, too. No sorrows of Werther, now,\nover such\"--He laughed again. \"Don't scowl, I'll be good. I won't say\nit. You'll supply the word, in two months!\"\n\nHe let the pony have his way, and was off in a clatter. Lonely, fuming\nwith resentment, Rudolph stared after him. What could he know, this\nairy, unfeeling meddler, so free with his advice and innuendo? Let him\ngo, then, let him canter away. He had seen quickly, guessed with a\ndiabolic shrewdness, yet would remain on the surface, always, of a\nmystery so violent and so profound. The young man stalked into his\nvacant nunnery in a rage, a dismal pomp of emotion: reason telling him\nthat a friend had spoken sense, imagination clothing him in the sceptred\npall of tragedy.\n\nYet one of these unwelcome words had stuck: he was Werther, it was\ntrue--a man who came too late. Another word was soon fulfilled; for the\nhot weather came, sudden, tropical, ferocious. Without gradation, the\nvernal days and languid noons were gone in a twinkling. The change came\nlike another act of a play. One morning--though the dawn stirred cool\nand fragrant as all dawns before--the \"boy\" laid out Rudolph's white\ntunic, slipped in the shining buttons, smeared pipe-clay on his heaviest\nhelmet; and Rudolph, looking from his window, saw that on the river, by\nthe same instinct, boatmen were stretching up their bamboo awnings.\nBreakfast was hardly ended, before river, and convex field, and huddling\nred tiles of the town, lay under a blurred, quivering distortion. The\nday flamed. At night, against a glow of fiery umber, the western hills\nbroke sharp and thin as sheet-iron, while below them rose in flooding\nmirage a bright strip of magical water.\n\nThus, in these days, he rode for his exercise while the sun still lay\nbehind the ocean; and thus her lively, pointed face and wide blue eyes,\nwondering or downcast or merry, were mingled in his thoughts with the\nfirst rousing of the world, the beat of hoofs in cool silences, the wide\nlights of creation over an aged, weary, alien empire. Their ponies\nwhinnying like old friends, they met, by chance or appointment, before\nthe power of sleep had lifted from eyes still new and strange against\nthe morning. Sometimes Chantel the handsome rode glowering beside them,\nsometimes Gilly, erect and solid in the saddle, laid upon their talk all\nthe weight of his honest, tired commonplaces.\n\nBut one morning she cantered up alone, laughing at her escape. His pony\nbolted, and they raced along together as comrades happily join forces in\na headlong dream. Quivering bamboo swept behind them; the river, on\ntheir other hand, met and passed in hurrying panorama. They had no time\nfor words, but only laughter. Words, indeed, had never yet advanced them\nbeyond that moment on the pagoda. And now, when their ponies fell into\na shambling trot, came the first impulse of speech.\n\n\"How lucky!\" she cried. \"How lucky we came this way! Now I can really\ntest you!\"\n\nHe turned. Her glowing face was now averted, her gesture was not for\nhim, but for the scene. He studied that, to understand her.\n\nThe river, up which they had fled, now rested broad and quiet as a\nshallow lake, burnished faintly, brooded over by a floating, increasing\nlight, not yet compounded into day. Tussocks, innumerable clods and\ncrumbs of vivid green, speckled all the nearer water. On some of these\nstorks meditated,--sage, pondering heads and urbane bodies perched high\non the frailest penciling of legs. In the whole expanse, no movement\ncame but when a distant bird, leaving his philosophic pose, plunged\ndownward after a fish. Beyond them rose a shapeless mound or isle, like\nsome half-organic monster grounded in his native ooze.\n\n\"There!\" said the woman, pointing. \"Are you all excuses, like the\nothers? Or do you dare?\"\n\n\"I am not afraid of anything--now,\" retorted Rudolph, and with truth,\nafter the dash of their twilight encounter. \"Dare what?\"\n\n\"Go see what's on that island,\" she answered. \"I dared them all. Twice\nI've seen natives land there and hurry away. Mr. Nesbit was too lazy to\ntry; Dr. Chantel wearing his best clothes. Maurice Heywood refused to\nmire his horse for a whim. Whim? It's a mystery! Come, now. Do\nyou dare?\"\n\nIn a rare flush of pride, Rudolph wheeled his stubborn mount and bullied\nhim down the bank. A poor horseman, he would have outstripped Curtius to\nthe gulf. But no sooner had his dancing pony consented to make the first\nrebellious, sidelong plunge, than he had small joy of his boast.\nFore-legs sank floundering, were hoisted with a terrified wrench of the\nshoulders, in the same moment that hind-legs went down as by suction.\nThe pony squirmed, heaved, wrestled in a frenzy, and churning the red\nwater about his master's thighs, went deeper and fared worse. With a\nclangor of wings, the storks rose, a streaming rout against the sky,\ntrailed their tilted legs, filed away in straggling flight, like figures\ninterlacing on a panel. At the height of his distress, Rudolph caught a\nwhirling glimpse of the woman above him, safe on firm earth, easy in her\nsaddle, and laughing. Quicksand, then, was a joke,--but he could not\npause for this added bewilderment.\n\nThe pony, using a skill born of agony, had found somewhere a solid verge\nand scrambled up, knee-deep, well out from the bank. With a splash,\nRudolph stood beside him among the tufts of salad green. As he patted\nthe trembling flanks, he heard a cry from the shore.\n\n\"Oh, well done!\" she mocked them. \"Well done!\"\n\nA gust of wholesome anger refreshed him. She might laugh, but now he\nwould see this folly through. He tore off his coat, flung it across the\nsaddle, waded out alone through the tussocks, and shooting forward full\nlength in the turbid water, swam resolutely for the island.\n\nSky and water brightened while he swam; and as he rose, wrapped in the\nleaden weight of dripping clothes, the sun, before and above him,\ntouched wonderfully the quaggy bank and parched grasses. He lurched\nashore, his feet caked with enormous clods as of melting chocolate. A\nfilthy scramble left him smeared and disheveled on the summit. He had\ncome for nothing. The mound lay vacant, a tangled patch, a fragment of\nwilderness.\n\nYet as he stood panting, there rose a puny, miserable sound. What\npresence could lurk there? The distress, it might be, of some small\nanimal--a rabbit dying in a forgotten trap. Faint as illusion, a wail, a\nthin-spun thread of sorrow, broke into lonely whimpering, and ceased. He\nmoved forward, doubtfully, and of a sudden, in the scrubby level of the\nisle, stumbled on the rim of a shallow circular depression.\n\nAt first, he could not believe the discovery; but next instant--as at\nthe temple pond, though now without need of placard or interpreter--he\nunderstood. This bowl, a tiny crater among the weeds, showed like some\npaltry valley of Ezekiel, a charnel place of Herod's innocents, the\nbattlefield of some babes' crusade. A chill struck him, not from the\nwater or the early mists. In stupor, he viewed that savage fact.\n\nThrough the stillness of death sounded again the note of living\ndiscontent. He was aware also of some stir, even before he spied, under\na withered clump, the saffron body of an infant girl, feebly squirming.\nBy a loathsome irony, there lay beside her an earthen bowl of rice, as\nan earnest or symbol of regret.\n\nBlind pity urged him into the atrocious hollow. Seeing no further than\nthe present rescue, he caught up the small unclean sufferer, who moaned\nthe louder as he carried her down the bank, and waded out through the\nsludge. To hold the squalling mouth above water, and swim, was no simple\nfeat; yet at last he came floundering among the tussocks, wrapped the\nnaked body in his jacket, and with infinite pains tugged his terrified\npony along a tortuous bar to the land.\n\nOnce in the river-path, he stood gloomily, and let Mrs. Forrester canter\nup to join him. Indeed, he had almost forgotten her.\n\n\"Splendid!\" she laughed. \"What a figure of fun! But what can you have\nbrought back? Oh, please! I can't wait!\"\n\nHe turned on her a muddy, haggard face, without enthusiasm, and gently\nunfolded the coat. The man and the woman looked down together, in\nsilence, at the child. He had some foolish hope that she would take it,\nthat his part was ended. Like an outlandish doll, with face contorted\nand thick-lidded eyes shut tightly against the sunshine, the outcast\nwhimpered, too near the point of death for even the rebellion of\narms and legs.\n\nThe woman in the saddle gave a short, incredulous cry. Her face, all gay\ncuriosity, had darkened in a shock of disgust.\n\n\"What in the world!\" she scolded. \"Oh! Such a nasty little--Why\ndid--What do you propose doing with it?\"\n\nRudolph shook his head, like a man caught in some stupid blunder.\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" he explained heavily. \"She has no--no\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Cover it,\" his companion ordered. \"Cover it up. I can't bear to see\nit.\"\n\nWith a sombre, disappointed air, he obeyed; then looked up, as if in her\nface he read strange matter.\n\n\"I can't bear,\" she added quickly, \"to see any kind of suffering. Why\ndid--It's all my fault for sending you! We were having such a good ride\ntogether, and now I've spoiled it all, with this.--Poor little filthy\nobject!\" She turned her hands outward, with a helpless, dainty gesture.\n\"But what can we do? These things happen every day.\"\n\nRudolph was studying the ground again. His thoughts, then, had wronged\nher. Drenched and downhearted, holding this strange burden in his\njacket, he felt that he had foolishly meddled in things inevitable,\nbeyond repair. She was right. Yet some vague, insurgent instinct, which\nwould not down, told him that there had been a disappointment. Still,\nwhat had he expected? No woman could help; no woman.\n\nThen suddenly he mounted, bundle and all, and turned his willing pony\nhomeward.\n\n\"Come,\" he said; and for the first time, unwittingly, had taken charge.\n\n\"What is it?\" she called. \"You foolish boy! What's your plan?\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" he answered. Without waiting, he beckoned her to follow.\nShe came. They rode stirrup to stirrup, silent as in their escape at\ndawn, and as close bodily, but in spirit traveling distant parallels. He\ngave no thought to that, riding toward his experiment. Near the town, at\nlast, he reined aside to a cluster of buildings,--white walls and rosy\ntiles under a great willow.\n\n\"You may save your steps,\" she declared, with sudden petulance. \"The\nhospital's more out of funds than ever, and more crowded. They'll not\nthank you.\"\n\nRudolph nodded back at her, with a queer smile, half reckless and half\nconfident.\n\n\"Then,\" he replied, dismounting, \"I will replenish my nunnery.\"\n\nSquatting coolies sprang up and raced to hold his pony. Others, in the\nshade of the wall, cackled when they saw a Son of the Red-Haired so\nbeplastered and sopping. A few pointed at his bundle, with grunts of\nsudden interest; and a leper, bearing the visage as of a stone lion\ndefaced by time, cried something harshly. At his words, the whole band\nof idlers began to chatter.\n\nRudolph turned to aid his companion. She sat watching them sharply. An\nuneasy light troubled the innocent blue eyes, which had not even a\nglance for him.\n\n\"No, I shan't get down,\" she said angrily. \"It's just what might\nbe--Your little brat will bring no good to any of us.\"\n\nHe flung away defiantly, strode through the gate, and calling aloud,\ntraversed an empty compound, already heated by the new-risen sun. A\ncooler fringe of veranda, or shallow cloister, lined a second court. Two\nfigures met him,--the dark-eyed Miss Drake, all in white, and behind\nher a shuffling, grinning native woman, who carried a basin, in which\npermanganate of potash swam gleaming like diluted blood.\n\n\"Good-morning.\" With one droll look of amusement, the girl had\nunderstood, and regained that grave yet happy, friendly composure which\nhad the virtue, he discovered, of being easily forgotten, to be met each\ntime like something new. \"What have you there for us?\"\n\nAgain he unfolded the jacket.\n\n\"A child.\"\n\nThe naked mite lay very still, the breath weakly fluttered. A somewhat\nnauseous gift, the girl raised her arms and received it gently, without\nhaste,--the saffron body appearing yet more squalid against the\nPalladian whiteness of her tunic, plain and cool as drapery in marble.\n\n\"It may live,\" she said. \"We'll do what we can.\" And followed by the\nblack-trousered woman, she moved quickly away to offer battle with\ndeath. A plain, usual fact, it seemed, involving no more surprise than\nrepugnance. Her face had hardly altered; and yet Rudolph, for the first\ntime in many days, had caught the fleeting brightness of compassion.\nMere light of the eyes, a half-imagined glory, incongruous in the sharp\nsmell of antiseptics, it left him wondering in the cloister. He knew now\nwhat had been missing by the river. \"I was naked, and\"--how ran the\nlines? He turned to go, recalling in a whirl snatches of truth he had\nnever known since boyhood, never seen away from home.\n\nAcross a court the padre hailed him,--a tall, ungainly patriarch under\nan enormous mushroom helmet of solar pith,--and walking along beside,\nlistened shrewdly to his narrative. They paused at the outer gate. The\npadre, nodding, frowning slightly, stood at ease, all angles and loose\njoints, as if relaxed by the growing heat.\n\nSuddenly he stood erect as a grenadier.\n\n\"That lie again!\" he cried. \"Listen!\"\n\nThe leper, without, harangued from his place apart, in a raucous voice\nfilled with the solitary pride of intellect.\n\n\"Well, men shall revile you,\" growled Dr. Earle. \"He says we steal\nchildren, to puncture their eyes for magic medicine!\"\n\nThen, heaving his wide shoulders,--\n\n\"Oh, well!\" he said wearily, \"thanks, anyhow. Come see us, when we're\nnot so busy? Good!--Look out these fellows don't fly at you.\"\n\nTired and befouled, Rudolph passed through into the torrid glare. The\nleper cut short his snarling oration. But without looking at him, the\nyoung man took the bridle from the coolie. There had been a test. He had\nseen a child, and two women. And yet it was with a pang he found that\nMrs. Forrester had not waited.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nTHE HOT NIGHT\n\nRudolph paced his long chamber like a wolf,--a wolf in summer, with too\nthick a coat. In sweat of body and heat of mind, he crossed from window\nto window, unable to halt.\n\nA faintly sour smell of parched things, oppressing the night without\nbreath or motion, was like an interminable presence, irritating,\npoisonous. The punkah, too, flapped incessant, and only made the lamp\ngutter. Broad leaves outside shone in mockery of snow; and like snow the\nstifled river lay in the moonlight, where the wet muzzles of buffaloes\nglistened, floating like knots on sunken logs, or the snouts of\ncrocodiles. Birds fluttered, sleepless and wretched. Coolies, flung\nasleep on the burnt grass, might have been corpses, but for the sound of\ntheir troubled breathing.\n\n\"If I could believe,\" he groaned, sitting with hands thrust through his\nhair. \"If I believe in her--But I came too late.\"\n\nThe lamp was an added torment. He sprang up from it, wiped the drops off\nhis forehead, and paced again. He came too late. All alone. The collar\nof his tunic strangled him. He stuffed his fingers underneath, and\nwrenched; then as he came and went, catching sight in a mirror, was\nshocked to see that, in Biblical fashion, he had rent his garments.\n\n\"This is bad,\" he thought, staring. \"It is the heat. I must not stay\nalone.\"\n\nHe shouted, clapped his hands for a servant, and at last, snatching a\ncoat from his unruffled boy, hurried away through stillness and\nmoonlight to the detested club. On the stairs a song greeted him,--a\nfragment with more breath than melody, in a raw bass:--\n\n\n\"Jolly boating weather,\nAnd a hay harvest breeze!\"\n\n\n\"Shut up!\" snarled another voice. \"Good God, man!\"\n\nThe loft was like a cave heated by subterranean fires. Two long punkahs\nflapped languidly in the darkness, with a whine of pulleys. Under a\nswinging lamp, in a pool of light and heat, four men sat playing cards,\ntheir tousled heads, bare arms, and cinglets torn open across the chest,\ngiving them the air of desperadoes.\n\n\"Jolly boating weather,\" wheezed the fat Sturgeon. He stood apart in\nshadow, swaying on his feet. \"What would you give,\" he propounded\nthickly, \"for a hay harvest breeze?\"\n\nHe climbed, or rolled, upon the billiard-table, turned head toward\npunkah, and suddenly lay still,--a gross white figure, collapsed and\nsprawling.\n\n\"How much does he think a man can stand?\" snapped Nesbit, his lean\nCockney face pulled in savage lines. \"Beast of a song! He'll die\nto-night, drinking.\"\n\n\"Die yourself,\" mumbled the singer, \"'m goin' sleep. More 'n you can\ndo.\"\n\nA groan from the players, and the vicious flip of a card, acknowledged\nthe hit. Rudolph joined them, ungreeting and ungreeted. The game went on\ngrimly, with now and then the tinkle of ice, or the popping of soda\nbottles. Sharp cords and flaccid folds in Wutzler's neck, Chantel's\nbrown cheeks, the point of Heywood's resolute chin, shone wet and\npolished in the lamplight. All four men scowled pugnaciously, even the\npale Nesbit, who was winning. Bad temper filled the air, as palpable as\nthe heat and stink of the burning oil.\n\nOnly Heywood maintained a febrile gayety, interrupting the game\nperversely, stirring old Wutzler to incoherent speech.\n\n\"What's that about Rome?\" he asked. \"You were saying?\"\n\n\"Rome is safed!\" cried the outcast, with sudden enthusiasm. \"In your\npaper _Tit-bit_, I read. How dey climb der walls op, yes, but Rome is\nsafed by a flook of geeze. Gracious me, der History iss great sopjeck!\nI lern moch.--But iss Rome yet a fortify town?\"\n\nChantel rapped out a Parisian oath.\n\n\"Do we play cards,\" he cried sourly, \"or listen to the chatter of\nsenility?\"\n\nHeywood held to the previous question.\n\n\"No, Wutz, that town's no longer fortified,\" he answered slowly. \"Geese\nlive there, still, as in--many other places.\"\n\nDr. Chantel examined his finger-tips as though for some defect; then,\nsnatching up the cards, shuffled and dealt with intense precision. The\ngame went on as before.\n\n\"I read alzo,\" stammered Wutzler, like a timid scholar encouraged to\nlecture, \"I read zo how your Englishman, Rawf Ralli, he spreadt der fine\nclock for your Queen, and lern your Queen smoking, no?\" He mopped his\nlean throat with the back of his hand. \"In Bengal are dere Rallis. Dey\nhandle jute.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Heywood smiled a weary indulgence. Next instant he whirled on\nRudolph in fury.--\"Is this a game, or Idiot's Joy?\"\n\n\"I'm playing my best,\" explained Rudolph, sulkily.\n\n\"Then your best is the worst I ever saw! Better learn, before sitting\nin!\"\n\nChantel laughed, without merriment; Rudolph flung down his cards,\nstalked to the window, and stood looking out, in lonely, impotent rage.\nA long time passed, marked by alarming snores from the billiard-table.\nThe half-naked watchers played on, in ferocious silence. The night wore\nalong without relief.\n\nHours might have lapsed, when Dr. Chantel broke out as though the talk\nhad but paused a moment.\n\n\"So it goes!\" he sneered. \"Fools will always sit in, when they do not\nknow. They rush into the water, also, and play the hero!\"\n\nAgain his laughter was brief but malignant. Heywood had left his cards,\nrisen, and crossing the room, stood looking over Rudolph's shoulder into\nthe snowy moonlight. On the shoulder his hand rested, as by accident.\n\n\"It's the heat, old chap,\" he said wearily. \"Don't mind what we say\nto-night.\"\n\nRudolph made no sign, except to move from under his hand, so that, with\ntheir quarrel between them, the two men stared out across the blanched\nroofs and drooping trees, where long black shadows at last crept\ntoward the dawn.\n\n\"These heroes!\" continued the mocker. \"What is danger? Pouf--nothing!\nThey make it for the rest of us, so easily! Do you know,\" his voice rose\nand quickened, \"do you know, the other end of town is in an uproar? We\nmurder children, it appears, for medicine!\"\n\nRudolph started, turned, but now sat quiet under Heywood's grasp.\nChantel, in the lamplight, watched the punkahs with a hateful smile.\n\n\"The Gascons are not all dead,\" he murmured. \"They plunge us all into a\nturmoil, for the sake of a woman.\" He made a sudden startling gesture,\nlike a man who has lost control. \"For the sake,\" he cried angrily, \"of a\nperson we all know! Oh! we all know her! She is nothing more--\"\n\nThere was a light scuffle at the window.\n\n\"Dr. Chantel,\" began Heywood, with a sharp and dangerous courtesy, \"we\nare all unlike ourselves to-night. I am hardly the person to remind you,\nbut this club is hardly the place--\"\n\n\"Oh, la la!\" The other snapped his fingers, and reverting to his native\ntongue, finished his sentence wildly.\n\n\"You cad!\" Heywood advanced in long strides deliberately, as if\ngathering momentum for a collision. Before his blow could fall, he was\nsent spinning. Rudolph, his cheeks on fire, darted past and dealt, full\nforce, a clumsy backhand sweep of the arm. Light and quick as a leopard,\nChantel was on foot, erect, and even while his chair crashed on the\nfloor, had whipped out a handkerchief.\n\n\"You are right, Mr. Heywood,\" he said, stanching his lips, in icy\ncomposure. His eyes held an odd gleam of satisfaction. \"You are right.\nWe are not like ourselves, at present. I will better ask Mr. Sturgeon to\nsee your friend to-morrow morning. This morning, rather.\"\n\nNot without dignity, he turned, stepped quickly to the stairs, saluted\ngravely, and went down.\n\n\"No, no!\" panted Nesbit, wrestling with Rudolph. \"Easy on, now! Let you\ngo? No fear!\"\n\nHeywood wrenched the captive loose, but only to shake him violently, and\nthrust him into a chair.\n\n\"Be quiet, you little ass!\" he scolded. \"I've a great mind, myself, to\nrun after the bounder and kick him. But that sort of thing--you did\nenough. Who'd have thought? You young spitfire! Chantel took you on,\nexactly as he wanted.\"\n\nThe fat sleeper continued to snore. Wutzler came slinking back from his\nrefuge in the shadows.\n\n\"It iss zo badt!\" he whined, gulping nervously. \"It iss zo badt!\"\n\n\"Right you are,\" said Heywood. With arms folded, he eyed them sternly.\n\"It's bad. We might have known. If only I'd reached him first! By Jove,\nyou must let me fight that beast. Duels? The idiot, nobody fights duels\nany more. I've always--His cuffs are always dirty, too, on the inside!\"\n\nRudolph leaned back, like a man refreshed and comforted, but his laugh\nwas unsteady, and too boisterous.\n\n\"It is well,\" he bragged. \"Pistol-bullets--they fly on the wings of\nchance! No?--All is well.\"\n\n\"Pistols? My dear young gentleman,\" scoffed his friend, \"there's not a\npair of matched pistols in the settlement. And if there were, Chantel\nhas the choice. He'll take swords.\"\n\nHe paused, in a silence that grew somewhat menacing. From a slit in the\nwall the wheel of the punkah-thong whined insistently,--rise and fall,\nrise and fall of peevish complaint, distressing as a brain-fever bird.\n\n\"Swords, of course,\" continued Heywood. \"If only out of vanity.\nFencing,--oh, I hate the man, and the art's by-gone, if you like, but\nhe's a beautiful swordsman! Wonderful!\"\n\nRudolph still lay back, but now with a singular calm.\n\n\"It's just as well,\" he declared quietly.\n\nHeywood loosed a great breath, a sigh of vast relief.\n\n\"My word!\" he cried, grinning. \"So you're there, too, eh? You young\nSly-boots! If you're another expert--Bravo! We'll beat him at his own\ngame! Hoist with his own what-d'-ye-call-it! I'd give anything\"--He\nthumped the table, and pitched the cards broadcast, like an explosion of\nconfetti, in a little carnival of glee. \"You old Sly-boots!--But are you\nsure? He's quick as lightning.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" replied Rudolph, modestly. He trained his young\nmoustache upward with steady fingers, and sat very quiet, thinking long\nthoughts. A quaint smile played about his eyes.\n\n\"Good for you!\" said Heywood. \"Now let him come, as the Lord Mayor said\nof the hare. What sport! With an even chance--And what a load off\none's mind!\"\n\nHe moved away to the window, as though searching for air. Instead of\nmoonlight, without, there swam the blue mist of dawn.\n\n\"Not a word must ever reach old Gilly,\" he mused. \"Do you hear, Nesbit?\"\n\n\"If you think,\" retorted the clerk, stiffly, \"I don't know the proper\ncourse of be'aviour! Not likely!\"\n\nThe tall silhouette in the window made no reply, but stood grumbling\nprivately: \"A club! Yes, where we drink out of jam-pots--dead cushions,\ndead balls--no veranda--fellow that soils the inside of his cuffs first!\nWe're a pack of beach-combers.\"\n\nHe propped his elbows on the long sill, and leaned out, venting\nfragments of disgust. Then of a sudden he turned, and beckoned eagerly.\n\"Come here, you chaps. Look-see.\"\n\nThe others joined him. Gray vapors from river and paddy-field, lingering\nlike steam in a slow breeze, paled and dispersed in the growing light,\nas the new day, worse than the old, came sullenly without breath or\nrespite. A few twilight shapes were pattering through the narrow\nstreet--a squad of Yamen runners haling a prisoner.\n\n\"The Sword-Pen remains active,\" said Heywood, thoughtfully. \"That dingy\nlittle procession, do you know, it's quite theatrical? The Cross and the\nDragon. Eh? Another act's coming.\"\n\nEven Rudolph could spare a misgiving from his own difficulty while he\nwatched the prisoner. It was Chok Chung, the plump Christian merchant,\nslowly trudging toward the darkest of human courts, to answer for the\ndeath of the cormorant-fisher. The squad passed by. Rudolph saw again\nthe lighted shop, the tumbled figure retching on the floor; and with\nthese came a memory of that cold and scornful face, thinking so cruelly\namong the unthinking rabble. The Sword-Pen had written something in\nthe dark.\n\n\"I go find out\"; and Wutzler was away, as keen as a village gossip.\n\n\"Trouble's comin',\" Nesbit asserted glibly. \"There's politics afloat.\nBut I don't care.\" He stretched his arms, with a weary howl. \"That's the\nfirst yawn I've done to-night. Trouble keeps, worse luck. I'm off--seek\nmy downy.\"\n\nAlone with the grunting sleeper, the two friends sat for a long time and\nwatched the flooding daylight.\n\n\"What,\" began Rudolph, suddenly, and his voice trembled, \"what is your\ntrue opinion? You are so kind, and I was just a fool. That other day, I\nwould not listen. You laughed. Now tell me, so--as you were to die next.\nYou were joking? Can I truly be proud of--of her?\"\n\nHe leaned forward, white and eager, waiting for the truth like a dicer\nfor the final throw.\n\n\"Of yourself, dear old chap. Not of the lady. She's the fool, not you.\nPoor old Gilly Forrester slaves here to send her junketing in Japan,\nKashmir, Ceylon, Home. What Chantel said--well, between the two of us,\nI'm afraid he's right. It's a pity.\"\n\nHeywood paused, frowning.\n\n\"A pity, too, this quarrel. So precious few of us, and trouble ahead.\nThe natives lashing themselves into a state of mind, or being lashed.\nThe least spark--Rough work ahead, and here we are at swords' points.\"\n\n\"And the joke is,\" Rudolph added quietly, \"I do not know a sword's point\nfrom a handle.\"\n\nHeywood turned, glowered, and twice failed to speak.\n\n\"Rudie--old boy,\" he stammered, \"that man--Preposterous! Why, it's plain\nmurder!\"\n\nRudolph stared straight ahead, without hope, without illusions, facing\nthe haggard light of morning. A few weeks ago he might have wept; but\nnow his laugh, short and humorous, was worthy of his companion.\n\n\"I do not care, more,\" he answered. \"Luck, so called I it, when I\nescaped the militar' service. Ho ho! Luck, to pass into the _Ersatz!_--I\ndo not care, now. I cannot believe, even cannot I fight.\nWorthless--dreamer! My deserts. It's a good way out.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nPASSAGE AT ARMS\n\n\"Boy.\"\n\n\"Sai.\"\n\n\"S'pose Mr. Forrester bym-by come, you talkee he, master no got, you\nchin-chin he come-back.\"\n\n\"Can do.\"\n\nThe long-coated boy scuffed away, across the chunam floor, and\ndisappeared in the darkness. Heywood submitted his head once more to the\nnimble hands of his groom, who, with horse-clippers and a pair of\nenormous iron shears, was trimming the stubborn chestnut locks still\ncloser. The afternoon glow, reflected from the burnt grass and white\nwalls of the compound, struck upward in the vault-spaces of the ground\nfloor, and lighted oddly the keen-eyed yellow mafoo and his serious\nyoung master.\n\nNesbit, pert as a jockey, sat on the table swinging his feet furiously.\n\n\"Sturgeon would take it all right, of course,\" he said, with airy\nwisdom. \"Quite the gentleman, he is. Netch'rally. No fault of his.\"\n\n\"Not the least,\" Heywood assented gloomily. \"Did everything he could.\nIf I were commissioned to tell 'em outright--'The youngster can't\nfence'--why, we might save the day. But our man won't even listen to\nthat. Fight's the word. Chantel will see, on the spot, directly they\nface. But will that stop him? No fear: he's worked up to the pitch of\nkilling. He'll lunge first, and be surprised afterward.--So regrettable!\nSuch remorse!--Oh, I know _him!_\"\n\nThe Cockney fidgeted for a time. His face--the face of a street-bred\nurchin--slowly worked into lines of abnormal cunning.\n\n\"I say! I was thinking,\" he ventured at last. \"Two swords, that's all?\nJust so. Now--my boy used to be learn-pidgin at Chantel's. Knows that\n'ouse inside out--loafs there now, the beggar, with Chantel's cook. Why\nnot send him over--prowling, ye know--fingers the bric-a-brac, bloomin'\nass, and breaks a sword-blade. Perfectly netch'ral. 'Can secure, all\nplopah,' Accident, ye know. All off with their little duel. What?\"\n\nHeywood chuckled, and bowed his head to the horse-clippers.\n\n\"Last week,\" he replied. \"Not to-day. This afternoon's rather late for\naccidents. You make me feel like Pompey on his galley: 'This thou\nshouldst have done, and not have spoken on't,'--Besides, those swords\nbelonged to Chantel's father. He began as a gentleman.--But you're a\ngood sort, Nesbit, to take the affair this fashion.\"\n\nLost in smoke, the clerk grumbled that the gory affair was unmentionable\nnonsense.\n\n\"Quite,\" said Heywood. \"We've tried reasoning. No go. As you say, an\naccident. That's all can save the youngster now. Impossible, of course.\"\nHe sighed. Then suddenly the gray eyes lighted, became both shrewd and\ndistant; a malicious little smile stole about the corners of his mouth.\n\"Have-got! The credit's yours, Nesbit. Accident: can do. And this\none--by Jove, it won't leave either of 'em a leg to stand on!--Here,\nmafoo, makee finish!\"\n\nHe sprang up, clapped a helmet on the shorn head, and stalked out into\nthe sunlight.\n\n\"Come on,\" he called. \"It's nearly time. We must pick up our young\nHotspur.\"\n\nThe clerk followed, through the glowing compound and the road. In the\nshade of the nunnery gate they found Rudolph, who, raising his rattan,\nsaluted them with a pale and stoic gravity.\n\n\"Are we ready?\" he asked; and turning, took a slow, cool survey of the\nnunnery, as though looking his last--from the ditch at their feet to the\nred tiles, patched with bronze mould, that capped the walls and the\nroof. \"I never left any place with less regret. Come, let's go.\"\n\nThe three men had covered some ground before Rudolph broke the silence.\n\n\"You'll find a few little things up there in my strong-box, Maurice.\nSome are marked for you, and the rest--will you send them Home, please?\"\nHe hesitated. \"I hope neither of you will misunderstand me. I'm horribly\nafraid, but not--but only because this fellow will make me look absurd.\nIf I knew the first motion!\" He broke out angrily. \"I cannot bear to\nhave him laugh, also! I cannot bear!\"\n\nHeywood clapped him on the shoulder, and gave a queer cough.\n\n\"If that's all, never you fear! I'll teach you your guard. 'Once in a\nwhile we can finish in style.' Eh?--Rudie, you blooming German, I--I\nthink we must have been brothers! We'll pull it off yet.\"\n\nHeywood spoke with a strange alacrity, and tried again to cough. This\ntime, however, there was no mistake--he was laughing.\n\nRudolph shot at him one glance of startled unbelief, and then, tossing\nhis head, marched on without a word. Pride and loneliness overwhelmed\nhim. The two at his side were no companions--not even presences. He\nwent alone, conscious only of the long flood of sunset, and the black\ninterlacing pattern of bamboos. The one friendly spirit had deserted,\nlaughing; yet even this last and worst of earthly puzzles did not\nmatter. It was true, what he had read; this, which they called death,\nwas a lonely thing.\n\nOn a broken stone bench, Sturgeon, sober and dejected, with puffy\ncircles under his eyes, sat waiting. A long parcel, wrapped in green\nbaize, lay across his knees. He nodded gloomily, without rising. At his\nfeet wandered a path, rankly matted with burnt weeds, and bordered with\ngreen bottle-ends, the \"dimples\" choked with discs of mud. The place was\na deserted garden, where the ruins of a European house--burnt by natives\nin some obscure madness, years ago--sprawled in desolation among wild\nshrubs. A little way down the path stood Teppich and Chantel, each with\nhis back turned and his hands clasped, like a pair of sulky Napoleons,\none fat, one slender. The wooden pretense of their attitude set Rudolph,\nfor an instant, to laughing silently and bitterly. This final\nscene,--what justice, that it should be a mean waste, the wreck of silly\npleasure-grounds, long forgotten, and now used only by grotesque\nplay-actors. He must die, in both action and setting, without dignity.\nIt was some comfort, he became aware, to find that the place was fairly\nprivate. Except for the breach by which they had entered, the blotched\nand spotted compound walls stood ruinous yet high, shutting out all but\na rising slant of sunlight, and from some outpost line of shops, near\nby, the rattle of an abacus and the broken singsong of argument, now\nharsh, now drowsy.\n\nHeywood had been speaking earnestly to Sturgeon:--\n\n\"A little practice--try the balance of the swords. No more than fair.\"\n\n\"Fair? Most certainly,\" croaked that battered convivialist. \"Chantel\ncan't object.\"\n\nHe rose, and waddled down the path. Rudolph saw Chantel turn, frowning,\nthen nod and smile. The nod was courteous, the smile full of satire. The\nfat ambassador returned.\n\n\"Right-oh,\" he puffed, tugging from the baize cover a shining pair of\nbell-hilted swords. \"Here, try 'em out.\" His puffy eyes turned furtively\ntoward Rudolph. \"May be bad form, Hackh, but--we all wish you luck, I\nfancy.\" Then, in a burst of candor, \"Wish that unspeakable ass felt as\nseedy as I do--heat-stroke--drop dead--that sort of thing.\"\n\nStill grumbling treason, this strange second rejoined his principal.\n\n\"Jackets off,\" commanded Heywood; and in their cinglets, each with sword\nunder arm, the two friends took shelter behind a ragged clump of\nplantains. The yellow leaves, half dead with drought and blight, hung\nponderous as torn strips of sheet metal in the lifeless air.\n\nBehind this tattered screen, Rudolph studied, for a moment, the lethal\nobject in his hand. It was very graceful,--the tapering, three-cornered\nblade, with shallow grooves in which blood was soon to run, the silver\nhilt where his enemy's father had set, in florid letters, the name of\n\"H.B. St. A. Chantel,\" and a date. How long ago, he thought, the steel\nwas forged for this day.\n\n\"It is Fate.\" He looked up sadly. \"Come, show me how to begin; so that I\ncan stand up to him.\"\n\n\"Here, then.\" Slowly, easily, his long limbs transformed with a sudden\nyouthful grace, Heywood moved through the seven positions of On\nGuard. \"Try it.\"\n\nRudolph learned only that his own clumsy imitation was hopeless.\n\n\"Once more.--He can't see us.\"\n\nAgain and again, more and more rapidly, they performed the motions of\nthis odd rehearsal. Suddenly Heywood stepped back, and lowering his\npoint, looked into his pupil's face, long and earnestly.\n\n\"For the last time,\" he said: \"won't you let me tell him? This is\nextremely silly.\"\n\nRudolph hung his head, like a stubborn child.\n\n\"Do you still think,\" he answered coldly, \"that I would beg off?\"\n\nWith a hopeless gesture of impatience, Heywood stepped forward briskly.\n\"Very well, then. Once more.\" And as their blades clashed softly\ntogether, a quick light danced in his eyes. \"Here's how our friend will\nstick you!\" His point cut a swift little circle, and sped home. By a\nwild instinct, the novice beat it awkwardly aside. His friend laughed,\npoised again, disengaged again, but in mid-career of this heartless\nplay, stumbled and came pitching forward. Rudolph darted back, swept his\narm blindly, and cried out; for with the full impetus of the mishap, a\nshock had run from wrist to elbow. He dropped his sword, and in\nstupefaction watched the red blood coursing down his forearm, and his\nthird finger twitching convulsively, beyond control.\n\n\"Dear fellow!\" cried his opponent, scrambling upright. \"So sorry! I say,\nthat's a bad one.\" With a stick and a handkerchief, he twisted on a\ntourniquet, muttering condolence: \"Pain much? Lost my balance, you know.\nThat better?--What a clumsy accident!\" Then, dodging out from the\nplantain screen, and beckoning,--\"All you chaps! Come over here!\"\n\nNesbit came running, but at sight of the bloody victim, pulled up short.\n\"What ho!\" he whispered, first with a stare, then a grin of mysterious\njoy. Sturgeon gave a sympathetic whistle, and stolidly unwound bandages.\nAt first the two Napoleons remained aloof, but at last, yielding to\nindignant shouts, haughtily approached. The little group stood at fault.\n\nHeywood wiped his sword-blade very carefully on a plantain leaf; then\nstood erect, to address them with a kind of cool severity.\n\n\"I regret this more than anybody,\" he declared, pausing, and picking his\nwords. \"We were at practice, and my friend had the misfortune to be run\nthrough the arm.\"\n\nChantel flung out his hands, in a motion at once furious and impudent.\n\n\"Zut! What a farce!--Will you tell me, please, since your friend has\ndisabled himself\"--\n\nHeywood wheeled upon him, scornfully.\n\n\"You have no right to such an expression,\" he stated, with a coldness\nwhich conveyed more rage than the other man's heat. \"This was entirely\nmy fault. It's I who have spoiled your--arrangement, and therefore I am\nquite ready to take up my friend's quarrel.\"\n\n\"I have no quarrel with you,\" replied Chantel, contemptuously. \"You saw\nlast night how he--\"\n\n\"He was quicker than I, that's all. By every circumstance, I'm the\nnatural proxy. Besides\"--the young man appealed to the company,\nsmiling--\"besides, what a pity to postpone matters, and spoil the\noccasion, when Doctor Chantel has gone to the trouble of a clean shirt.\"\n\nThe doctor recoiled, flung up a trembling arm, and as quickly dropped\nit. His handsome face burned darker, then faded with a mortal pallor,\nand for one rigid moment, took on such a strange beauty as though it\nwere about to be translated into bronze. His brown fingers twitched,\nbecame all nerves and sinews and white knuckles. Then, stepping\nbackward, he withdrew from the circle.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said lightly. \"Since we are all so--irregular. I will\ntake the substitute.\"\n\nRudolph gave a choking cry, and would have come forward; but Sturgeon\nclung to the wounded arm, and bound on his bandage.\n\n\"Hold still, there!\" he scolded, as though addressing a horse; then\ngrowled in Heywood's ear, \"Why did _you_ go lose your temper?\"\n\n\"Didn't. We can't let him walk over us, though.\" The young man held the\nsword across his throat, and whispered, \"Only angry up to here!\"\n\nAnd indeed, through the anxious preliminary silence, he stood waiting as\ncool and ready as a young centurion.\n\nHis adversary, turning back the sleeves of the unfortunate white linen,\npicked up the other sword, and practiced his fingering on the silver\nhilt, while the blade answered as delicately as the bow to a violinist.\nAt last he came forward, with thin lips and hard, thoughtful eyes, like\na man bent upon dispatch. Both men saluted formally, and sprang\non guard.\n\nFrom the first twitter of the blades, even Rudolph knew the outcome.\nHeywood, his face white and anxious in the failing light, fought at full\nstretch, at the last wrench of skill. Chantel, for the moment, was\nfencing; and though his attacks came ceaseless and quick as flame, he\nwas plainly prolonging them, discarding them, repeating, varying,\nwhether for black-hearted merriment, or the vanity of perfect form, or\nlove of his art. Graceful, safe, easy, as though performing the grand\nsalute, he teased and frolicked, his bright blade puzzling the sight,\nscattering like quicksilver in the endless whirl and clash.\n\nTeppich was gaping foolishly, Sturgeon shaking his head, the Cockney,\nwith narrow body drawn together, watching, shivering, squatting on toes\nand finger-tips, like a runner about to spring from a mark. Rudolph,\ndizzy with pain and suspense, nursed his forearm mechanically. The\nhurried, silver ring of the hilts dismayed him, the dust from the garden\npath choked him like an acrid smoke.\n\nSuddenly Chantel, dropping low like a deflected arrow, swooped in with\nfingers touching the ground. On \"three feet,\" he had delivered the blow\nso long withheld.\n\nThe watchers shouted. Nesbit sprang up, released. But Heywood, by some\ndesperate sleight, had parried the certainty, and even tried a riposte.\nStill afoot and fighting, he complained testily above the sword-play:--\n\n\"Don't shout like that! Fair field, you chaps!\"\n\nAbove the sword-play, too, came gradually a murmur of voices. Through\nthe dust, beyond the lunging figures, Rudolph was distantly aware of\ncrowded bodies, of yellow faces grinning or agape, in the breach of the\ncompound wall. Men of the neighboring hamlet had gathered, to watch the\nforeign monsters play at this new, fantastic game. Shaven heads bobbed,\nsaffron arms pointed, voices, sharp and guttural, argued scornfully.\n\nThe hilts rang, the blades grated faster. But now it was plain that\nHeywood could do no more, by luck or inspiration. Fretted by his clumsy\nyet strong and close defense, Chantel was forcing on the end. He gave a\npanting laugh. Instantly, all saw the weaker blade fly wide, the\nstronger swerve, to dart in victorious,--and then saw Doctor Chantel\nstaggering backward, struck full in the face by something round and\nheavy. The brown missile skipped along the garden path.\n\nAnother struck a bottle-end, and burst into milk-white fragments, like a\nbomb. A third, rebounding from Teppich's girdle, left him bent and\ngasping. Strange yells broke out, as from a tribe of apes. The air was\nthick with hurtling globes. Cocoanuts rained upon the company,\ntempestuously, as though an invisible palm were shaken by a hurricane.\nAmong them flew sticks, jagged lumps of sun-dried clay, thick scales\nof plaster.\n\n\"Aow!\" cried Nesbit, \"the bloomin' coolies!\" First to recover, he\nskipped about, fielding and hurling back cocoanuts.\n\nA small but raging phalanx crowded the gap in the wall, throwing\ncontinually, howling, and exhorting one another to rush in.\n\n\"A riot!\" cried Heywood, and started, sword in hand. \"Come on, stop\n'em!\"\n\nBut it was Nesbit who, wrenching a pair of loose bottles from the path,\nbrandishing them aloft like clubs, and shouting the unseemly\nbattle-cries of a street-fighter, led the white men into this deadly\nbreach. At the first shock, the rioters broke and scattered, fled round\ncorners of the wall, crashed through bamboos, went leaping across\npaddy-fields toward the river. The tumult--except for lonely howls in\nthe distance--ended as quickly as it had risen. The little band of\nEuropeans returned from the pursuit, drenched with sweat, panting, like\na squad of triumphant football players; but no one smiled.\n\n\"That explains it,\" grumbled Heywood. He pointed along the path to\nwhere, far off, a tall, stooping figure paced slowly toward the town,\nhis long robe a moving strip of color, faint in the twilight. \"The\nSword-Pen dropped some remarks in passing.\"\n\nThe others nodded moodily, too breathless for reply. Nesbit's forehead\nbore an ugly cut, Rudolph's bandage was red and sopping. Chantel, more\nrueful than either, stared down at a bleeding hand, which held two\nshards of steel. He had fallen, and snapped his sword in the rubble of\nold masonry.\n\n\"No more blades,\" he said, like a child with a broken toy; \"there are no\nmore blades this side of Saigon.\"\n\n\"Then we must postpone.\" Heywood mopped his dripping and fiery cheeks.\nHe tossed a piece of silver to one who wailed in the ditch,--a forlorn\nstranger from Hai-nan, lamenting the broken shells and empty baskets of\nhis small venture.--\"Contribution, you chaps. A bad day for imported\ncocoanuts. Wish I carried some money: this chit system is\ndamnable.--Meanwhile, doctor, won't you forget anything I was rude\nenough to say? And come join me in a peg at the club? The heat is\nexcessive.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nTHREE PORTALS\n\nNot till after dinner, that evening, did Rudolph rouse from his stupor.\nWith the clerk, he lay wearily in the upper chamber of Heywood's house.\nThe host, with both his long legs out at window, sat watching the smoky\nlights along the river, and now and then cursing the heat.\n\n\"After all,\" he broke silence, \"those cocoanuts came time enough.\"\n\n\"Didn't they just?\" said Nesbit, jauntily; and fingering the plaster\ncross on his wounded forehead, drawled: \"You might think I'd done a bit\no' dueling myself, by the looks.--But I had _some_ part. Now, that\naccident trick. Rather neat, what? But for me, you might never have\nthought o' that--\"\n\n\"Idiot!\" snapped Heywood, and pulling in his legs, rose and stamped\nacross the room.\n\nA glass of ice and tansan smashed on the floor. Rudolph was on foot,\nclutching his bandaged arm as though the hurt were new.\n\n\"You!\" he stammered. \"You did that!\" He stood gaping, thunderstruck.\n\nFelt soles scuffed in the darkness, and through the door, his yellow\nface wearing a placid and lofty grin, entered Ah Pat, the compradore.\n\n\"One coolie-man hab-got chit.\"\n\nHe handed a note to his master, who snatched it as though glad of the\ninterruption, bent under the lamp, and scowled.\n\nThe writing was in a crabbed, antique German character:--\n\n\"Please to see bearer, in bad clothes but urgent. We are all in danger.\n_Um Gottes willen_--\" It straggled off, illegible. The signature, \"Otto\nWutzler,\" ran frantically into a blot.\n\n\"Can do,\" said Heywood. \"You talkee he, come topside.\"\n\nThe messenger must have been waiting, however, at the stairhead; for no\nsooner had the compradore withdrawn, than a singular little coolie\nshuffled into the room. Lean and shriveled as an opium-smoker, he wore\nloose clothes of dirty blue,--one trousers-leg rolled up. The brown\nface, thin and comically small, wore a mask of inky shadow under a\nwicker bowl hat. His eyes were cast down in a strange fashion, unlike\nthe bold, inquisitive peering of his countrymen,--the more strange, in\nthat he spoke harshly and abruptly, like a racer catching breath.\n\n\"I bring news.\" His dialect was the vilest and surliest form of the\ncolloquial \"Clear Speech.\"--\"One pair of ears, enough.\"\n\n\"You can speak and act more civilly,\" retorted Heywood, \"or taste the\nbamboo.\"\n\nThe man did not answer, or look up, or remove his varnished hat. Still\ndowncast and hang-dog, he sidled along the verge of the shadow, snatched\nfrom the table the paper and a pencil, and choosing the darkest part of\nthe wall, began to write. The lamp stood between him and the company:\nHeywood alone saw--and with a shock of amazement--that he did not print\nvertically as with a brush, but scrawled horizontally. He tossed back\nthe paper, and dodged once more into the gloom.\n\nThe postscript ran in the same shaky hand:--\n\n\"Send way the others both.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the young master of the house; and then over his shoulder,\n\"Excuse us a moment--me, I should say.\"\n\nHe led the dwarfish coolie across the landing, to the deserted\ndinner-table. The creature darted past him, blew out one candle, and\nthrust the other behind a bottle, so that he stood in a wedge of shadow.\n\n\"Eng-lish speak I ver' badt,\" he whispered; and then with something\nbetween gasp and chuckle, \"but der _pak-wa_ goot, no? When der live\ndependt, zo can mann--\" He caught his breath, and trembled in a\nstrong seizure.\n\n\"Good?\" whispered Heywood, staring. \"Why, man, it's wonderful! You\n_are_ a coolie\"--Wutzler's conical wicker-hat ducked as from a blow. \"I\nbeg your pardon. I mean, you're--\"\n\nThe shrunken figure pulled itself together.\n\n\"You are right,\" he whispered, in the vernacular. \"To-night I am a\ncoolie--all but the eyes. Therefore this hat.\"\n\nHeywood stepped back to the door, and popped his head out. The dim hall\nwas empty.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said, returning. \"What is your news?\"\n\n\"Riots. They are coming. We are all marked for massacre. All day I ran\nabout the town, finding out. The trial of Chok Chung, your--_our_\nChristian merchant--I saw him 'cross the hall.' They kept asking, 'Do\nyou follow the foreign dogs and goats?' But he would only answer, 'I\nfollow the Lord Jesus.' So then they beat out his teeth with a heavy\nshoe, and cast him into prison. Now they wait, to see if his padre will\ninterfere with the law. It is a trap. The suit is certainly brought by\nFang the scholar, whom they call the Sword-Pen.\"\n\n\"That much,\" said Heywood, \"I could have told you.\"\n\nWutzler glanced behind him fearfully, as though the flickering shadows\nmight hear.\n\n\"But there is more. Since dark I ran everywhere, watching, listening to\ngossip. I painted my skin with mangrove-bark water. You know this\nsign?\" He patted his right leg, where the roll of trousers bound his\nthigh. \"It is for protection in the streets. It says, 'I am a\nHeaven-and-Earth man.'\"\n\n\"The Triad!\" Heywood whistled. \"You?\"\n\nThe other faltered, and hung his head.\n\n\"Yes,\" he whispered at last. \"My--my wife's cousin, he is a Grass\nSandal. He taught her the verses at home, for safety.--We mean no harm,\nnow, we of the Triad. But there is another secret band, having many of\nour signs. It is said they ape our ritual. Fang the scholar heads their\nlodge. They are the White Lotus.\"\n\n\"White Lotus?\" Heywood snapped his fingers. \"Nonsense. Extinct, this\nhundred years.\"\n\n\"Extinct? They meet to-night,\" said the outcast, in sudden grief and\npassion. \"They drink blood--plan blood. Extinct? Are _you_ married to\nthese people? Does the knowledge come so cheap, or at a price? All these\nyears--darkness--sunken--alone\"--He trembled violently, but regained his\nvoice. \"O my friend! This very night they swear in recruits, and set the\nday. I know their lodge-room. For any sake, believe me! I know!\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Heywood, curtly. \"I believe you. But why come here? Why\nnot stay, and learn more?\"\n\nWutzler's head dropped on his breast again. The varnished hat gleamed\nsoftly in the darkness.\n\n\"I--I dare not stay,\" he sobbed.\n\n\"Oh, exactly!\" Heywood flung out an impatient arm. \"The date, man! The\nday they set. You came away without it!--We sit tight, then, and wait in\nignorance.\"\n\nThe droll, withered face, suddenly raised, shone with great tears that\nstreaked the mangrove stain.\n\n\"My head sits loosely already, with what I have done to-night. I found a\nlistening place--next door: a long roof. You can hear and see them--But\nI could not stay. Yes, I am a coward.\"\n\n\"There, there!\" Heywood patted his shoulder. \"I didn't mean--Here, have\na drink.\"\n\nThe man drained the tumbler at a gulp; stood without a word, sniffing\nmiserably; then of a sudden, as though the draught had worked, looked up\nbold and shrewd.\n\n\"Do you?\" he whispered. \"Do _you_ dare go to the place I show you, and\nhide? You would learn.\"\n\nHeywood started visibly, paused, then laughed.\n\n\"Excellent,\" he said. \"_Tu quoque_ is good argument. Can you smuggle\nme?--Then come on.\" He stepped lightly across the landing, and called\nout, \"You chaps make yourselves at home, will you? Business, you know.\nWhat a bore! I'll not be back till late.\" And as he followed the\nslinking form downstairs, he grumbled, \"If at all, perhaps.\"\n\nThe moon still lurked behind the ocean, making an aqueous pallor above\nthe crouching roofs. The two men hurried along a \"goat\" path, skirted\nthe town wall, and stole through a dark gate into a darker maze of\nlonely streets. Drawing nearer to a faint clash of cymbals in some\njoss-house, they halted before a blind wall.\n\n\"In the first room,\" whispered the guide, \"a circle is drawn on the\nfloor. Put your right foot there, and say, 'We are all in-the-circle\nmen,' If they ask, remember: you go to pluck the White Lotus. These men\nhate it, they are Triad brothers, they will let you pass. You come from\nthe East, where the Fusang cocks spit orient pearls; you studied in the\nRed Flower Pavilion; your eyes are bloodshot because\"--He lectured\nearnestly, repeating desperate nonsense, over and over. \"No: not so. Say\nit exactly, after me.\"\n\nThey held a hurried catechism in the dark.\n\n\"There,\" sighed Wutzler, at last, \"that is as much as we can hope. Do\nnot forget. They will pass you through hidden ways.--But you are very\nrash. It is not too late to go home.\"\n\nReceiving no answer, he sighed more heavily, and gave a complicated\nknock. Bars clattered within, and a strip of dim light widened. \"Who\ncomes?\" said a harsh but guarded voice, with a strong Hakka brogue.\n\n\"A brother,\" answered the outcast, \"to pluck the White Lotus. Aid,\nbrothers.--Go in, I can help no further. If you are caught, slide down,\nand run westward to the gate which is called the Meeting of\nthe Dragons.\"\n\nHeywood nodded, and slipped in. Beside a leaf-point flame of peanut-oil,\na broad, squat giant sat stiff and still against the opposite wall, and\nstared with cruel, unblinking eyes. If the stranger were the first white\nman to enter, this motionless grim janitor gave no sign. On the earthen\nfloor lay a small circle of white lime. Heywood placed his right foot\ninside it.\n\n\"We are all in-the-circle men.\"\n\n\"Pass,\" said the guard.\n\nOut from shadow glided a tall native with a halberd, who opened a door\nin the far corner.\n\nIn the second room, dim as the first, burned the same smoky orange light\non the same table. But here a twisted <DW36>, his nose long and\npendulous with elephantiasis, presided over three cups of tea set in a\nrow. Heywood lifted the central cup, and drank.\n\n\"Will you bite the clouds?\" asked the second guard, in a soft and husky\nbass. As he spoke, the great nose trembled slightly.\n\n\"No, I will bite ginger,\" replied the white man.\n\n\"Why is your face so green?\"\n\n\"It is a melon-face--a green face with a red heart.\"\n\n\"Pass,\" said the <DW36>, gently. He pulled a cord--the nose quaking\nwith this exertion--and opened the third door.\n\nAgain the chamber was dim. A venerable man in gleaming silks--a\ngrandfather, by his drooping rat-tail moustaches--sat fanning himself.\nIn the breath of his black fan, the lamplight tossed queer shadows\nleaping, and danced on the table of polished camagon. Except for this\nunrest, the aged face might have been carved from yellow soapstone. But\nhis slant eyes were the sharpest yet.\n\n\"You have come far,\" he said, with sinister and warning courtesy.\n\nToo far, thought Heywood, in a sinking heart; but answered:--\n\n\"From the East, where the Fusang cocks spit orient pearls.\"\n\n\"And where did you study?\" The black fan stopped fluttering.\n\n\"In the Red Flower Pavilion.\"\n\n\"What book did you read?\"\n\n\"The book,\" said Heywood, holding his wits by his will, \"the book was\nTen Thousand Thousand Pages.\"\n\n\"And the theme?\"\n\n\"The waters of the deluge crosswise flow.\" \"And what\"--the aged voice\nrose briskly--\"what saw you on the waters?\"\n\n\"The Eight Abbots, floating,\" answered Heywood, negligently.--\"But,\" ran\nhis thought, \"he'll pump me dry.\"\n\n\"Why,\" continued the examiner, \"do you look so happy?\"\n\n\"Because Heaven has sent the Unicorn.\"\n\nThe black fan began fluttering once more. It seemed a hopeful sign; but\nthe keen old eyes were far from satisfied.\n\n\"Why have you such a sensual face?\"\n\n\"I was born under a peach tree.\"\n\n\"Pass,\" said the old man, regretfully. And Heywood, glancing back from\nthe mouth of a dark corridor, saw him, beside the table of camagon,\nwagging his head like a judge doubtful of his judgment.\n\nThe narrow passage, hot, fetid, and blacker than the wholesome night\nwithout, crooked about sharp corners, that bruised the wanderer's hands\nand arms. Suddenly he fell down a short flight of slimy steps, landing\nin noisome mud at the bottom of some crypt. A trap, a suffocating well,\nhe thought; and rose filthy, choked with bitterness and disgust. Only\nthe taunting justice of Wutzler's argument, the retort _ad hominem_, had\nsent him headlong into this dangerous folly. He had scolded a coward\nwith hasty words, and been forced to follow where they led. To this\nloathsome hole. Behind him, a door closed, a bar scraped softly into\nplace. Before him, as he groped in rage and self-reproach, rose a vault\nof solid plaster, narrow as a chimney.\n\nBut presently, glancing upward, he saw a small cluster of stars\nblinking, voluptuous, immeasurably overhead. Their pittance of light, as\nhis eyesight cleared, showed a ladder rising flat against the wall. He\nreached up, grasped the bamboo rungs, hoisted with an acrobatic wrench,\nand began to climb cautiously.\n\nAbove, faint and muffled, sounded a murmur of voices.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nWHITE LOTUS\n\nHe was swarming up, quiet as a thief, when his fingers clawed the bare\nplaster. The ladder hung from the square end of a protruding beam, above\nwhich there were no more rungs. He hung in doubt.\n\nThen, to his great relief, something blacker than the starlight gathered\ninto form over his head,--a slanting bulk, which gradually took on a\nfamiliar meaning. He chuckled, reached for it, and fingering the rough\nedge to avoid loose tiles, hauled himself up to a foothold on the beam,\nand so, flinging out his arms and hooking one knee, scrambled over and\nlay on a ribbed and mossy surface, under the friendly stars. The outcast\nand his strange brethren had played fair: this was the long roof, and\nclose ahead rose the wall of some higher building, an upright blackness\nfrom which escaped two bits of light,--a right angle of hairbreadth\nlines, and below this a brighter patch, small and ragged. Here, louder,\nbut confused with a gentle scuffing of feet, sounded the voices of the\nrival lodge.\n\nToward these he crawled, stopping at every creak of the tiles. Once a\nbroken roll snapped off, and slid rattling down the roof. He sat up,\nevery muscle ready for the sudden leap and shove that would send him\nsliding after it into the lower darkness. It fell but a short distance,\ninto something soft. Gradually he relaxed, but lay very still. Nothing\nfollowed; no one had heard.\n\nHe tried again, crawled forward his own length, and brought up snug and\nsafe in the angle where roof met wall. The voices and shuffling feet\nwere dangerously close. He sat up, caught a shaft of light full in his\nface, and peered in through the ragged chink. Two legs in bright,\nwrinkled hose, and a pair of black shoes with thick white soles, blocked\nthe view. For a long time they shifted, uneasy and tantalizing. He could\nhear only a hubbub of talk,--random phrases without meaning. The legs\nmoved away, and left a clear space.\n\nBut at the same instant, a grating noise startled him, directly\noverhead, out of doors. The thin right angle of light spread instantly\ninto a brilliant square. With a bang, a wooden shutter slid open.\nHeywood lay back swiftly, just as a long, fat bamboo pipe, two sleeves,\nand the head of a man in a red silk cap were thrust out into the\nnight air.\n\n\"_Ai-yah!\"_ sighed the man, and puffed at his bamboo. \"It is hot.\"\n\nHeywood tried to blot himself against the wall. The lounger, propped on\nelbows, finished his smoke, spat upon the tiles, and remained, a pensive\nsilhouette.\n\n\"_Ai-yah!\"_ he sighed again; then knocking out the bamboo, drew in his\nhead. Not until the shutter slammed, did Heywood shake the burning\nsparks from his wrist.\n\nIn the same movement, however, he raised head and shoulders to spy\nthrough the chink. This time the bright-hosed legs were gone. He saw\nclear down a brilliant lane of robes and banners, multicolored, and\nshining with embroidery and tinsel,--a lane between two ranks of crowded\nmen, who, splendid with green and blue and yellow robes of ceremony,\nfaced each other in a strong lamplight, that glistened on their oily\ncheeks. The chatter had ceased. Under the crowded rows of shaven\nforeheads, their eyes blinked, deep-set and expectant. At the far end of\nthe loft, through two circular arches or giant hoops of rattan, Heywood\nat last descried a third arch, of swords; beyond this, a tall incense\njar smouldering gray wisps of smoke, beside a transverse table twinkling\nwith candles like an altar; and over these, a black image with a pale,\ncarved face, seated bolt upright before a lofty, intricate, gilded\nshrine of the Patriot War-God.\n\nA tall man in dove-gray silk with a high scarlet turban moved athwart\nthe altar, chanting as he solemnly lifted one by one a row of symbols: a\nround wooden measure, heaped with something white, like rice, in which\nstuck a gay cluster of paper flags; a brown, polished abacus; a mace\ncarved with a dragon, another carved with a phoenix; a rainbow robe,\ngleaming with the plumage of Siamese kingfishers. All these, and more,\nhe displayed aloft and replaced among the candles.\n\nWhen his chant ended, a brisk little man in yellow stepped forward into\nthe lane.\n\n\"O Fragrant Ones,\" he shrilled, \"I bring ten thousand recruits, to join\nour army and swear brotherhood. Attend, O Master of Incense.\"\n\nBehind him, a squad of some dozen barefoot wretches, in coolie clothes,\nwith queues un-plaited, crawled on all fours through the first arch.\nThey crouched abject, while the tall Master of Incense in the dove-gray\nsilk sternly examined their sponsor.\n\nIn the outer darkness, Heywood craned and listened till neck and\nshoulders ached. He could make nothing of the florid verbiage.\n\nWith endless ritual, the crawling novices reached the arch of swords.\nThey knelt, each holding above his head a lighted bundle of\nincense-sticks,--red sparks that quivered like angry fireflies. Above\nthem the tall Master of Incense thundered:--\n\n\"O Spirits of the Hills and Brooks, the Land, the swollen seeds of the\nground, and all the Veins of Earth; O Thou, young Bearer of the Axe that\ncleared the Hills; O Imperial Heaven, and ye, Five Dragons of the Five\nRegions, with all the Holy Influences who pass and instantly re-pass\nthrough unutterable space:--draw near, record our oath, accept the\ndraught of blood.\"\n\nHe raised at arm's length a heavy baton, which, with a flowing movement,\nunrolled to the floor a bright yellow scroll thickly inscribed. From\nthis he read, slowly, an interminable catalogue of oaths. Heywood could\ncatch only the scolding sing-song of the responses:--\n\n\"If any brother shall break this, let him die beneath ten thousand\nknives.\"\n\n\"--Who violates this, shall be hurled down into the great sky.\"\n\n\"--Let thunder from the Five Regions annihilate him.\"\n\nSilence followed, broken suddenly by the frenzied squawking of a fowl,\nas suddenly cut short. Near the chink, Heywood heard a quick struggling\nand beating. Next instant he lay flattened against the wall.\n\nThe shutter grated open, a flood of light poured out.\n\nWithin reach, in that radiance, a pair of sinewy yellow hands gripped\nthe neck of a white cock. The wretched bird squawked once more, feebly,\nflapped its wings, and clawed the air, just as a second pair of arms\nreached out and sliced with a knife. The cock's head flew off upon the\ntiles. Hot blood spattered on Heywood's cheek. Half blinded, but not\ndaring to move, he saw the knife withdrawn, and a huge goblet held out\nto catch the flow. Then arms, goblet, and convulsive wings jerked out of\nsight, and the shutter slid home.\n\n\"Twice they've not seen me,\" thought Heywood. It was darker, here, than\nhe had hoped. He rose more boldly to the peep-hole.\n\nUnder the arch of swords, the new recruits, now standing upright,\nstretched one by one their wrists over the goblet. The Incense Master\npricked each yellow arm, to mingle human blood with the blood of the\nwhite cock; then, from a brazen vessel, filled the goblet to the brim.\nIt passed from hand to hand, like a loving-cup. Each novice raised it,\nchanted some formula, and drank. Then all dispersed. There fell\na silence.\n\nSuddenly, in the pale face of the black image seated before the shrine,\nthe eyes turned, scanning the company with a cold contempt. The lips\nmoved. The voice, level and ironic, was that of Fang, the Sword-Pen:--\n\n\"O Fragrant Ones, when shall the foreign monsters perish like this\ncock?\"\n\nA man in black, with a red wand, bowed and answered harshly:--\n\n\"The time, Great Elder Brother, draws at hand.\"\n\n\"How shall we know the hour?\"\n\n\"The hour,\" replied the Red Wand, \"shall be when the Black Dog barks.\"\n\n\"And the day?\"\n\nHeywood pressed his ear against the chink, and listened, his five senses\nfused into one.\n\nNo answer came, but presently a rapid, steady clicking, strangely\nfamiliar and commonplace. He peered in again. The Red Wand stood by the\nabacus, rattling the brown beads with flying fingers, like a shroff.\nPlainly, it was no real calculation, but a ceremony before the answer.\nThe listener clapped his ear to the crevice. Would that answer, he\nwondered, be a month, a week, to-morrow?\n\nThe shutter banged, the light streamed, down went Heywood against the\nplaster. Thick dregs from the goblet splashed on the tiles. A head, the\nflattened profile of the brisk man in yellow, leaned far out from the\nlittle port-hole. Grunting, he shook the inverted cup, let it dangle\nfrom his hands, stared up aimlessly at the stars, and then--to Heywood's\nconsternation--dropped his head to meditate, looking straight down.\n\n\"He sees me,\" thought Heywood, and held himself ready, trembling. But\nthe fellow made no sign, the broad squat features no change. The pose\nwas that of vague, comfortable thought. Yet his vision seemed to rest,\ntrue as a plumb-line, on the hiding-place. Was he in doubt?--he could\nreach down lazily, and feel.\n\nWorst of all, the greenish pallor in the eastern sky had imperceptibly\nturned brighter; and now the ribbed edge of a roof, across the way,\nbegan to glow like incandescent silver. The moon was crawling up.\n\nThe head and the dangling goblet were slowly pulled in, just before the\nmoonlight, soft and sullen through the brown haze of the heat, stole\ndown the wall and spread upon the tiles. The shutter remained open. But\nHeywood drew a free breath: those eyes had been staring into vacancy.\n\n\"Now, then,\" he thought, and sat up to the cranny; for the rattle of the\nabacus had stopped.\n\n\"The counting is complete,\" announced the Red Wand slowly, \"the hours\nare numbered. The day--\"\n\nMovement, shadow, or nameless instinct, made the listener glance upward\nswiftly. He caught the gleam of yellow silk, the poise and downward jab,\nand with a great heave of muscles went shooting down the slippery\nchannel of the cock's blood. A spearhead grazed his scalp, and smashed\na tile behind him. As he rolled over the edge, the spear itself whizzed\nby him into the dark.\n\n\"The chap saw,\" he thought, in mid-air; \"beastly clever--all the time--\"\n\nHe landed on the spear-shaft, in a pile of dry rubbish, snatched up the\nweapon, and ran, dimly conscious of a quiet scurrying behind and above\nhim, of silent men tumbling after, and doors flung violently open.\n\nHe raced blindly, but whipped about the next corner, leaving the moon at\nhis back. Westward, somebody had told him, to the gate where\ndragons met.\n\nThere had been no uproar; but running his hardest down the empty\ncorridors of the streets, he felt that the pack was gaining. Ahead\nloomed something gray, a wall, the end of a blind alley. Scale it, or\nmake a stand at the foot,--he debated, racing. Before the decision came,\na man popped out of the darkness. Heywood shifted his grip, drew back\nthe spear, but found the stranger bounding lightly alongside, and\nmuttering,--\n\n\"To the west-south, quick! A brother waits. I fool those who follow--\"\n\nObeying, Heywood dove to the left into the black slit of an alley, while\nthe other fugitive pattered straight on into the seeming trap, with a\nyelp of encouragement to the band who swept after. The alley was too\ndark for speed. Heywood ran on, fell, rose and ran, fell again, losing\nhis spear. A pair of trembling hands eagerly helped him to his feet.\n\n\"My cozin's boy, he ron quick,\" said Wutzler. \"Dose fellows, dey not\ncatch him! Kom.\"\n\nThey threaded the gloom swiftly. Wutzler, ready and certain of his\nground, led the tortuous way through narrow and greasy galleries, along\nthe side of a wall, and at last through an unlighted gate, free of\nthe town.\n\nIn the moonlight he stared at his companion, cackled, clapped his\nthighs, and bent double in unholy convulsions.\n\n\"My gracious me!\" He laughed immoderately. \"Oh, I wait zo fearful, you\nkom zo fonny!\" For a while he clung, shaking, to the young man's arm.\n\"My friendt, zo fonny you look! My gootness me!\" At last he regained\nhimself, stood quiet, and added very pointedly, \"What did _yow_ lern?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Heywood, angrily. \"Nothing. Fragrant Ones! Not a bad\nname. Phew!--Oh, I say, what did they mean? What Black Dog is to bark?\"\n\n\"Black Dog? Black Dog iss cannon.\" The man became, once more, as keen as\na gossip. \"What cannon? When dey shoot him off?\"\n\n\"Can't tell,\" said his friend. \"That's to be their signal.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" The conical hat wagged sagely. \"I go find out.\" He\npointed across the moonlit spaces. \"Ofer dere iss your house. You can no\nmore. _Schlafen Sie wohl_.\"\n\nThe two men wrung each other's hands.\n\n\"Shan't forget this, Wutz.\"\n\n\"Oh, for me--all you haf done--\" The outcast turned away, shaking his\nhead sadly.\n\nNever did Heywood's fat water-jar glisten more welcome than when he\ngained the vaulted bath-room. He ripped off his blood-stained clothes,\nscrubbed the sacrificial clots from his hair, and splashed the cool\nwater luxuriously over his exhausted body. When at last he had thrown a\nkimono about him, and wearily climbed the stairs, he was surprised to\nsee Rudolph, in the white-washed room ahead, pacing the floor and\nardently twisting his little moustache. As Heywood entered, he wheeled,\nstared long and solemnly.\n\n\"I must wait to tell you.\" He stalked forward, and with his sound left\nhand grasped Heywood's right. \"This afternoon, you--\"\n\n\"My dear boy, it's too hot. No speeches.\"\n\nBut Rudolph's emotion would not be hindered.\n\n\"This afternoon,\" he persisted, with tragic voice and eyes, \"this\nafternoon I nearly was killed.\"\n\n\"So was I.--Which seems to meet that.\" And Heywood pulled free.\n\n\"Oh,\" cried Rudolph, fervently. \"I know! I feel--If you knew what I--My\nlife--\"\n\nThe weary stoic in the blue kimono eyed him very coldly, then plucked\nhim by the sleeve.--\"Come here, for a bit.\"\n\nBoth men leaned from the window into the hot, airless night. A Chinese\nrebeck wailed, monotonous and nasal. Heywood pointed at the moon, which\nnow hung clearly above the copper haze.\n\n\"What do you see there?\" he asked dryly.\n\n\"The moon,\" replied his friend, wondering.\n\n\"Good.--You know, I was afraid you might just see Rudie Hackh.\"\n\nThe rebeck wailed a long complaint before he added:--\n\n\"If I didn't like you fairly well--The point is--Good old Cynthia! That\nbally orb may not see one of us to-morrow night, next week, next\nquarter. 'Through this same Garden, and for us in vain.' Every man Jack.\nLet me explain. It will make you better company.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nTHE WAR BOARD\n\n\"Rigmarole?\" drawled Heywood, and abstained from glancing at Chantel.\n\"Dare say. However, Gilly, their rigmarole _may_ mean business. On that\nsupposition, I made my notes urgent to you chaps.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Mr. Forrester, tugging his gray moustache, and\nstudying the floor. \"Obviously. Rigmarole or not, your plan is\nthoroughly sound: stock one house, and if the pinch comes, fortify.\"\n\nChantel drummed on Heywood's long table, and smiled quaintly, with eyes\nwhich roved out at window, and from mast to bare mast of the few small\njunks that lay moored against the distant bank. He bore himself, to-day,\nlike a lazy cock of the walk. The rest of the council, Nesbit, Teppich,\nSturgeon, Kempner, and the great snow-headed padre, surrounded the table\nwith heat-worn, thoughtful faces. When they looked up, their eyes went\nstraight to Heywood at the head; so that, though deferring to his\nelders, the youngest man plainly presided.\n\nChantel turned suddenly, merrily, his teeth flashing in a laugh.\n\n\"If we are then afraid, let us all take a jonc down the river,\" he\nscoffed, \"or the next vessel for Hongkong!\"\n\nGilly's tired, honest eyes saw only the plain statement.\n\n\"Impossible.\" He shook his bullet head. \"We can't run away from a rumor,\nyou know. Can we, now? The women, perhaps. But we should lose face no\nend--horribly.\"\n\n\"Let's come to facts,\" urged Heywood. \"Arms, for example. What have we?\nTo my knowledge, one pair of good rifles, mine and Sturgeon's.\nAmmunition--uncertain, but limited. Two revolvers: my Webley.450, and\nthat little thing of Nesbit's, which is not man-stopping. Shot-guns?\nEvery one but you, padre: fit only for spring snipe, anyway, or bamboo\npartridge. Hackh has just taken over, from this house, the only real\nweapons in the settlement--one dozen old Mausers, Argentine, calibre.765.\nMy predecessor left 'em, and three cases of cartridges. I've kept\nthe guns oiled, and will warrant the lot sound.--Now, who'll lend me\nspare coolies, and stuff for sand-bags?\"\n\n\"Over where?\" puffed Sturgeon. \"Where's he taking your Mausers?\"\n\n\"Nunnery, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say!\" Mr. Forrester looked up, with an injured air. \"As the\nsenior here, except Dr. Earle, I naturally thought the choice would be\nmy house.\"\n\n\"Right!\" cried two or three voices from the foot of the table. \"It\nshould be--Farthest off--\"\n\nAll talked at once, except Chantel, who eyed them leniently, and smiled\nas at so many absurd children. Kempner--a pale, dogged man, with a\npompous white moustache which pouted and bristled while he spoke--rose\nand delivered a pointless oration. \"Ignoring race and creed,\" he droned,\n\"we must stand together--\"\n\nHeywood balanced a pencil, twirled it, and at last took to drawing. On\nthe polished wood he scratched, with great pains, the effigy of a pig,\nwhose snout blared forth a gale of quarter-notes.\n\n\"Whistle away!\" he muttered; then resumed, as if no one had interrupted:\n\"Very good of you, Gilly. But with your permission, I see five\npoints.--Here's a rough sketch, made some time ago.\"\n\nHe tossed on the table a sheet of paper. Forrester spread it, frowning,\nwhile the others leaned across or craned over his chair.\n\n\"All out of whack, you see,\" explained the draughtsman; \"but here are my\npoints, Gilly. One: your house lies quite inland, with four sides to\ndefend: the river and marsh give Rudie's but two and a fraction. Boats?\nNot hardly: we'd soon stop that, as you'll see, if they dare.\nAnyhow,--point two,--your house is all hillocks behind, and shops\nroundabout: here's just one low ridge, and the rest clear field. Third:\nthe Portuguese built a well of sorts in the courtyard; water's deadly, I\ndare say, but your place has no well whatever. And as to four,\nsuppose--in a sudden alarm, say, those cut off by land could run another\nhalf-chance to reach the place by river.--By the way, the nunnery has a\nbell to ring.\"\n\nGilbert Forrester shoved the map along to his neighbor, and cleared his\nthroat.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he declared slowly, \"you once did me the honor to say that\nin--in a certain event, you would consider me as acting head. Frankly, I\nconfess, my plans were quite--ah!--vague. I wish to--briefly, to resign,\nin favor of this young--ah--bachelor.\"\n\n\"Don't go rotting me,\" complained Heywood, and his sallow cheeks turned\nruddy. \"I merely bring up these points. And five is this: your\ncompound's very cramped, where the nunnery could shelter the goodly\nblooming fellowship of native converts.\"\n\nChantel laughed heartily, and stretched his legs at ease under the\ntable.\n\n[Illustration: Portuguese Nunnery:--Sketch Map.]\n\n\"What strategy!\" he chuckled, preening his moustache. \"Your mythical\nsiege--it will be brief! For me, I vote no to that: no rice-Christians\nfilling their bellies--eating us into a surrender!\" He made a pantomime\nof chop-sticks. \"A compound full, eating, eating!\"\n\nOne or two nodded, approving the retort. Heywood, slightly lifting his\nchin, stared at the speaker coldly, down the length of their\ncouncil-board. The red in his cheeks burned darker.\n\n\"Our everlasting shame, then,\" he replied quietly. \"It will be\neverlasting, if we leave these poor devils in the lurch, after cutting\nthem loose from their people. Excuse me, padre, but it's no time to\nmince our words. We made them strangers in their own land. Desert 'em?\nDamned if we do!\"\n\nNo one made reply. The padre, who had looked up, looked down quickly,\nmusing, and smoothed his white hair with big fingers that\nsomewhat trembled.\n\n\"Besides,\" continued the speaker, in a tone of apology, \"we'll need 'em\nto man the works. Meantime, you chaps must lend coolies, eh? Look here.\"\nWith rising spirits, he traced an eager finger along the map. \"I must\nrun a good strong bamboo scaffold along the inside wall, with plenty of\nsand-bags ready for loopholing--specially atop the servants' quarters\nand pony-shed, and in that northeast angle, where we'll throw up a\nmound or platform.--What do you say? Suggestions, please!\"\n\nChantel, humming a tune, reached for his helmet, and rose. He paused,\nstruck a match, and in an empty glass, shielding the flame against the\nbreeze of the punkah, lighted a cigarette.\n\n\"Since we have appointed our dictator,\" he began amiably, \"we may\nrepose--\"\n\nFrom the landing, without, a coolie bawled impudently for the master of\nthe house.\n\n\"Wutzler!\" said Heywood, jumping up. \"I mean--his messenger.\"\n\nHe was gone a noticeable time, but came back smiling.\n\n\"Good news, Gilly.\" He held aloft a scrap of Chinese paper, scrawled on\nwith pencil. \"We need expect nothing these ten days. They wait for more\nammunition--'more shoots,' the text has it. The Hak Kau--their Black\nDog--is a bronze cannon, nine feet long, cast at Rotterdam in 1607. He\nwrites, 'I saw it in shed last night, but is gone to-day. O.W.'\nGentlemen, for a timid man, our friend does not scamp his reports.\nThorough, rather? Little O.W. is O.K.\"\n\nChantel, still humming, had moved toward the door. All at once he\nhalted, and stared from the landward window. Cymbals clashed\nsomewhere below.\n\n\"What's this?\" he cried sharply. The noise drew nearer, more brazen,\nand with it a clatter of hoofs. \"Here come swordsmen!\"\n\n\"To play with you, I suppose. Your fame has spread.\" Heywood spoke with\na slow, mischievous drawl; but he crossed the room quickly. \"What's up?\"\n\nBelow, by the open gate, a gay grotesque rider reined in a piebald pony,\nand leaning down, handed to the house-boy a ribbon of scarlet paper.\nBehind him, to the clash of cymbals, a file of men in motley robes\nswaggered into position, wheeled, and formed the ragged front of a\nFalstaff regiment. Overcome by the scarlet ribbon, the long-coated \"boy\"\nbowed, just as through the gate, like a top-heavy boat swept under an\narch, came heaving an unwieldy screened chair, borne by four broad men:\nnot naked and glistening coolies, but \"Tail-less Horses\" in proud\nlivery. Before they could lower their shafts, Heywood ran clattering\ndown the stairs.\n\nSlowly, cautiously, like a little fat old woman, there clambered out\nfrom the broadcloth box a rotund man, in flowing silks, and a conical,\ntasseled hat of fine straw. He waddled down the compound path, shading\nwith his fan a shrewd, bland face, thoughtful, yet smooth as a babe's.\n\nThe watchers in the upper room saw Heywood greet him with extreme\nceremony, and heard the murmur of \"Pray you, I pray you,\" as with\nendless bows and deprecations the two men passed from sight, within the\nhouse. A long time dragged by. The visitor did not join the company, but\nfrom another room, now and then, sounded his clear-pitched voice, full\nof odd and courteous modulations. When at last the conference ended, and\ntheir unmated footsteps crossed the landing, a few sentences echoed from\nthe stairway.\n\n\"That is all,\" declared the voice, pleasantly. \"The Chow Ceremonial\nsays, 'That man is unwise who knowingly throws away precious things.'\nAnd in the Analects we read, 'There is merit in dispatch.'\"\n\nHeywood's reply was lost, except the words, \"stupid people.\"\n\n\"In every nation,\" agreed the placid voice. \"It is true. What says the\nViceroy of Hupeh: 'They see a charge of bird-shot, and think they are\ntasting broiled owl.'--Walk slowly!\"\n\n\"A safe walk, Your Excellency.\"\n\nThe cymbals struck up, the cavalcade, headed by ragamuffin lictors with\nwhips, went swaying past the gate. Heywood, when he returned,\nwas grinning.\n\n\"Wonderful old chap!\" he exclaimed. \"Hates this station, I fancy, much\nas we hate it.\"\n\n\"Anything to concern us?\" asked Gilly.\n\n\"Intimated he could beat me at chess,\" laughed the young man, \"and will\nbet me a jar of peach wine to a box of Manila cigars!\"\n\nChantel, from a derisive dumb-show near the window, had turned to waddle\nsolemnly down the room. At sight of Heywood's face he stopped guiltily.\n\n\"Chantel!\" All the laughter was gone from the voice and the hard gray\neyes. \"Yesterday we humored you tin-soldier fashion, but to-day let's\nput away childish things.--I like that magistrate, plainly, a damned\ndeal better than I like you. When you or I show one half his ability,\nwe're free to mock him--in my house.\"\n\nFor the first time within the memory of any man present, the mimic\nwilted.\n\n\"I--I did not know,\" he stammered, \"that old man was your friend.\" Very\nquiet, and a little flushed, he took his seat among the others.\n\n\"I like him no end.\" Still more quiet, Heywood appealed to the company.\n\"Part for his hard luck--stuck down, a three-year term, in this\nneglected hole. Enemies in power, higher up. Fang, the Sword-Pen, in\ngreat favor up there.--What? Oh, said nothing directly, of course.\nFriendly call, and all that. But his indirections speak straight enough.\nWe understood each other. The dregs of the town are all stirred\nup--bottomside topside--danger point. He, in case--you know--can't give\nus any help. No means, no recourse. His chief's fairly itching to\ncashier him.--Spoke highly of your hospital work, padre, but said, 'Even\ngood deeds may be misconstrued.'--In short, gentlemen, without saying a\nword, he tells us honestly in plain terms, 'Sorry, but look out for\nyourselves.'\"\n\nA beggar rattled his bowl of cash in the road, below; from up the river\nsounded wailing cries.\n\n\"Did he mention,\" said the big padre, presently, \"the case against my\nman, Chok Chung?\"\n\nHeywood's eyes became evasive, his words reluctant.\n\n\"The magistrate dodged that--that unpleasant subject. The case was\nforced on him. Some understrapper tried it. Let's be fair.\"\n\nDr. Earle's great elbows left the board. Without rising, he seemed to\ngrow in bulk and stature, and send his vision past the company, into\nthose things which are not, to confound the things which are.\n\n\"For myself, it does not matter. 'He buries His workmen, but carries on\nHis work.'\" The man spoke in a heavy, broken voice, as though it were\nhis body that suffered. \"But it comes hard to hear, from a young man, so\ngood a friend, after many years\"--The deep-set eyes returned, and with a\nsudden lustre, made a sharp survey from face to face. \"If I have made my\nflock a remnant--aliens--rejected--tell me, what shall I do? Tell me. I\nhave shut eyes and conscience, and never meddled, never!--not even when\nmoney was levied for the village idols. And here's a man beaten, cast\ninto prison--\"\n\nHe shoved both fists out on the table, and bowed his white head.\n\n\"My safety is nothing. But yours--and his.--To keep one, I desert the\nother. Either way.\" The padre groaned. \"What must I choose?\"\n\n\"We're all quite helpless,\" said Heywood, gently. \"Quite. It's a long\nway to the nearest gunboat.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" repeated the other, stubbornly.\n\nAt the same moment it happened that the cries came louder along the\nriver-bank, and that some one bounded up the stairs.\n\nThe runner was Rudolph. All morning he had gone about his errands very\ncalmly, playing the man of action, in a new philosophy learned\novernight. But now he forgot to imitate his teacher, and darted in, so\nheadlong that all the dogs came with him, bouncing and barking.\n\n\"Look,\" he called, stumbling toward the farther window, while Flounce\nthe terrier and a wonk puppy ran nipping at his heels. \"Come, look at\nthem! Out on the river!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nTHE SPARE MAN\n\nBeyond the scant greenery of Heywood's garden--a ropy little banyan, a\nlow rank of glossy whampee leaves, and the dusty sage-green tops of\nstunted olives--glared the river. Wide, savage sunlight lay so hot upon\nit, that to aching eyes the water shone solid, like a broad road of\nyellow clay. Only close at hand and by an effort of vision, appeared the\ntiny, quiet lines of the irresistible flood pouring toward the sea;\nthere whipped into the pool of banyan shade black snippets and tails of\nreflection, darting ceaselessly after each other like a shoal of\nfrightened minnows. But elsewhere the river lay golden, solid, and\npainfully bright. Things afloat, in the slumberous procession of all\nEastern rivers, swam downward imperceptibly, now blurred, now outlined\nin corrosive sharpness.\n\nThe white men stood crowding along the spacious window. The dogs barked\noutrageously; but at last above their din floated, as before, the high\nwailing cries. A heaping cairn of round-bellied, rosy-pink earthen jars\ncame steering past, poled by a naked statue of new copper, who balanced\nprecariously on the edge of his hidden raft. No sound came from him; nor\nfrom the funeral barge which floated next, where still figures in white\nrobes guarded the vermilion drapery of a bier, decked with vivid green\nboughs. All these were silent.\n\n\"No, above!\" cried Rudolph, pointing.\n\nAfter the mourners' barge, at some distance, came hurrying a boat\ncrowded with shining yellow bodies and dull blue jackets. Long bamboo\npoles plied bumping along her gunwale, sticking into the air all about\nher, many and loose and incoordinate, like the ribs of an unfinished\nbasket. From the bow spurted a white puff of smoke. The dull report of a\nmusket lagged across the water.\n\nThe bullet skipped like a schoolboy's pebble, ripping out little rags of\nwhite along that surface of liquid clay.\n\nThe line of fire thus revealed, revealed the mark. Untouched, a black\nhead bobbed vigorously in the water, some few yards before the boat. The\nsaffron crew, poling faster, yelled and cackled at so clean a miss,\nwhile a coolie in the bow reloaded his matchlock.\n\nThe fugitive head labored like that of a man not used to swimming, and\ndesperately spent. It now gave a quick twist, and showed a distorted\nface, almost of the same color with the water.\n\nThe mouth gaped black in a sputtering cry, then closed choking,\nsquirted out water, and gaped once more, to wail clearly:--\n\n\"I am Jesus Christ!\"\n\nIn the broad, bare daylight of the river, this lonely and sudden\nblasphemy came as though a person in a dream might declare himself to a\nwaking audience of skeptics. The cry, sharp with forlorn hope, rang like\nan appeal.\n\n\"Why--look,\" stammered Heywood. \"He sees us--heading here. Look,\nit's--Quick! let me out!\"\n\nJust as he turned to elbow through his companions, and just as the cry\nsounded again, the matchlock blazed from the bow. No bullet skipped. The\nswimmer, who had reached the shallows, suddenly rose with an incredible\nheave, like a leaping salmon, flung one bent arm up and back in the\ngesture of the Laocooen, and pitched forward with a turbid splash. The\nquivering darkness under the banyan blotted everything: death had\ndispersed the black minnows there, in oozy wriggles of shadow; but next\nmoment the fish-tail stripes chased in a more lively shoal. The gleaming\npotter, below his rosy cairn, stared. The mourners forgot their grief.\n\nHeywood, after his impulse of rescue, stood very quiet.\n\n\"You saw,\" he repeated dully. \"You all saw.\"\n\nThe clutching figure, bolt upright in the soaked remnant of prison\nrags, had in that leap and fall shown himself for Chok Chung, the\nChristian. He had sunk in mystery, to become at one forever with the\ndrunken cormorant-fisher.\n\nObscene delight raged in the crowded boat, with yells and laughter, and\nflourish of bamboo poles.\n\n\"Come away from the window,\" said Heywood; and then to the white-haired\ndoctor: \"Your question's answered, padre. Strange, to come so quick.\" He\njerked his thumb back toward the river. \"And that's only first blood.\"\n\nThe others had broken into wrangling.\n\n\"Escaped? Nonsense--Cat--and--mouse game, I tell you; those devils let\nhim go merely to--We'll never know--Of course! Plain as your nose--To\nstand by, and never lift a hand! Oh, it's--Rot! Look here,\nwhy--Acquitted, then set on him--But we'll _never_ know!--Fang watching\non the spot. Trust him!\"\n\nA calm \"boy,\" in sky-blue gown, stood beside them, ready to speak. The\ndispute paused, while they turned for his message. It was a\ndisappointing trifle: Mrs. Forrester waited below for her husband, to\nwalk home.\n\n\"Can't leave now,\" snapped Gilly. \"I'll be along, tell her--\"\n\n\"Had she better go alone?\" suggested Heywood.\n\n\"No; right you are.\" The other swept a fretful eye about the company.\n\"But this business begins to look urgent.--Here, somebody we can spare.\nYou go, Hackh, there's a good chap.\"\n\nChantel dropped the helmet he had caught up. Bowing stiffly, Rudolph\nmarched across the room and down the stairs. His face, pale at the late\nspectacle, had grown red and sulky, \"Can spare me, can you?--I'm the\none.\" He descended, muttering.\n\nViewing himself thus, morosely, as rejected of men, he reached the\ncompound gate to fare no better with the woman. She stood waiting in the\nshadow of the wall; and as he drew unwillingly near, the sight of\nher--to his shame and quick dismay--made his heart leap in welcome. She\nwore the coolest and severest white, but at her throat the same small\nfurbelow, every line of which he had known aboard ship, in the days of\nhis first exile and of his recent youth. It was now as though that youth\ncame flooding back to greet her.\n\n\"Good-morning.\" He forgot everything, except that for a few priceless\nmoments they would be walking side by side.\n\nShe faced him with a start, never so young and beautiful as now--her\nblue eyes wide, scornful, and blazing, her cheeks red and lips\ntrembling, like a child ready to cry.\n\n\"I did not want _you_\" she said curtly.\n\n\"Nor did they.\" Pride forged the retort for him, at a blow. He explained\nin the barest of terms, while she eyed him steadily, with every sign of\nrising temper.\n\n\"I can spare you, too,\" she whipped out; then turned to walk away,\nholding her helmet erect, in the poise of a young goddess, pert\nbut warlike.\n\nThis double injustice left Rudolph chafing. In two strides, however, he\nhad overtaken her.\n\n\"I am under orders,\" he stated grimly.\n\nHer pace gradually slackened in the growing heat; but she went forward\nwith her eyes fixed on the littered, sunken flags of their path. This\nrankling silence seemed to him more unaccountable and deadly than all\nformer mischances, and left him far more alone. From the sultry tops of\nbamboos, drooping like plants in an oven, an amorous multitude of\ncicadas maintained the buzzing torment of steel on emery wheels, as\nthough the universal heat had chafed and fretted itself into a dry,\nfeverish utterance. Once Mrs. Forrester looked about, quick and angry,\nlike one ready to choke that endless voice. But for the rest, the two\nstrange companions moved steadily onward.\n\nIn an alley of checkered light a buffalo with a wicker nose-ring, and\nheavy, sagging horns that seemed to jerk his head back in agony, heaved\ntoward them, ridden by a naked yellow infant in a nest-like saddle of\ngreen fodder. Scenting with fright the disgusting presence of white\naliens, the sleep-walking monster shied, opened his eyes, and lowered\nhis blue muzzle as if to charge. There was a pause, full of menace.\n\n\"Don't run!\" said Rudolph, and catching the woman roughly about the\nshoulders, thrust her behind him. She clutched him tightly by the\nwounded arm.\n\nThe buffalo stared irresolute, with evil eyes. The naked boy in the\ngreen nest brushed a swarm of flies from his handful of sticky\nsweetmeats, looked up, pounded the clumsy shoulders, and shrilled a\ncommand. Staring doubtfully, and trembling, the buffalo swayed past, the\nwrinkled armor of his gray hide plastered with dry mud as with yellow\nochre. To the slow click of hoofs, the surly monster, guided by a little\nchild, went swinging down the pastoral shade,--ancient yet living shapes\nfrom a picture immemorial in art and poetry.\n\n\"Please,\" begged Rudolph, trying with his left hand to loosen her grip.\n\"Please, that hurts.\"\n\nFor a second they stood close, their fingers interlacing. With a touch\nof contempt, he found that she still trembled, and drew short breath.\nHer eyes slowly gathered his meaning.\n\n\"Oh, that!\" She tore her hand loose, as though burned. \"That! It _was_\nall true, then. I forgot.\"\n\nShe caught aside her skirts angrily, and started forward in all her\nformer disdain. But this, after their brief alliance, was not to be\ntolerated.\n\n\"What was all true?\" he insisted. \"You shall not treat me so. If anybody\nhas a right--\"\n\nAfter several paces, she flashed about at him in a whirl of words:--\n\n\"All alike, every one of you! And I was fool enough to think you were\ndifferent!\" The conflict in her eyes showed real, beyond suspicion. \"He\ntold me all about it. Last evening. And you dare talk of rights, and\ncome following me here--\"\n\n\"Lucky I did,\" retorted Rudolph, with sudden spirit; and holding out his\nwounded arm, indignantly: \"That scratch, if you know how it came--\"\n\n\"I know, perfectly.\" She stared as at some crowning impudence. \"He was\nchicken-hearted. You came off cheaply.--I know all you said. But the one\nthing I'll never understand, is where you found the courage, after he\nstruck you, at the club. You'll always have _that_ to admire!\"\n\n\"After he struck\"--A light broke in on Rudolph, somehow. \"Chantel? Oh,\nthat liar!\"\n\nHe wheeled and started to go back.\n\n\"Wait, stop!\" she called, in a strangely altered voice, which brought\nhim up short. \"They're all with him now. You can't--What did you mean?\"\n\nHe explained, sulkily at first, but ending in a kind of generous rage.\n\"So I couldn't even stand up to him. And except for Maurice Heywood--Oh,\nyou need not frown; he's the best friend I ever had.\"\n\nMrs. Forrester had walked on, with the same cloudy aspect, the same\nlight, impatient step. He felt the greater surprise when, suddenly\nturning, she raised toward him her odd, enticing, pointed face, and the\nfriendly mischief of her eyes.\n\n\"The best?\" she echoed, in the same half-whisper as when she had\nflattered him, that afternoon in the dusky well of the pagoda stairway.\n\"The very best friend? Don't you think you have a better?\"\n\nRudolph stared.\n\n\"Oh, you funny, funny boy!\" she cried, with a bewildering laugh, of\ndelight and pride. \"I hate people all prim and circumspect, and\nyou--You'd have flown back there straight at him, before my--before all\nthe others. That's why I like you so!--But you must leave that horrid,\nlying fellow to me.\"\n\nAll unaware, she had led him along the blinding white wall of the\nForrester compound, and halted in the hot shadow that lay under the\ntiled gateway. As though timidly, her hand stole up and rested on\nhis forearm.\n\n\"So sorry.\" The confined space, narrow and covered, gave to her voice a\nplaintive ring. \"That's twice you protected me, and I hurt you.--You\n_are_ different. This doesn't happen between people, often. When you\ndid--that, for me, yesterday, didn't it seem different and rather\nsplendid, and--like a book?\"\n\n\"It seemed nonsense,\" replied Rudolph, sturdily. \"The heat. We were\nfools.\"\n\nShe laughed again, and at close range watched him from under consciously\ndrooping lashes that almost veiled a liquid brilliancy. Everywhere the\ncicadas kept the heat vibrating with their strident buzz. It recalled\nsome other widespread mist of treble music, long ago. The trilling of\nfrogs, that had been, before.\n\n\"You dear, brave boy,\" she said slowly. \"You're so honest, too. I'm not\nungrateful. Do you know what I'd like--Oh, there's the _amah!\"_\n\nShe drew back, with an impatient gesture.\n\n\"That stupid, fat Mrs. Earle's waiting for me.--I hate to leave you.\"\nThe stealthy brightness of her admiration changed to a slow, inscrutable\nappeal. \"Don't forget. Haven't you--a better friend?\" And with an\ninstant, bold, and tantalizing grimace, she had vanished within.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo his homeward march, her cicadas shrilled the music of fifes. He, the\ndespised, the man to spare, now cocked up his helmet like fortune's\nminion, dizzy with new honors. Nobody had ever praised him to his face.\nAnd now she, she of all the world, had spoken words which he feared and\nlonged to believe, and which even said still less than her searching and\nmysterious look.\n\nOn the top of his exultation, he reached the nunnery, and entered his\nbig, bare living-room, to find Heywood stretched in a wicker chair.\n\n\"Hallo, Rudie! I've asked myself to tiffin,\" drawled the lounger, from a\nlittle tempest of blue smoke, tossed by the punkah. \"How's the fair\nBertha?--Mausers all right? And by the way, did you make that inventory\nof provisions?\"\n\nRudolph faced him with a sudden conviction of guilt, of treachery to a\nleader.\n\n\"Yes,\" he stammered; \"I--I'll get it for you.\"\n\nHe passed into his bedroom, caught up the written list from a table, and\nfor a moment stood as if dreaming. Before him the Mausers, polished and\norderly, shone in their new rack against the lime-coated wall. Though\nappearing to scan them, Rudolph saw nothing but his inward confusion.\n\"After all this man did for me,\" he mused. What had loosed the bond,\nswept away all the effects?\n\nA sound near the window made him turn. An imp in white and red livery,\nPeng, the little billiard-marker from the club, stood hurling things\nviolently into the outer glare.\n\n\"What thing you do?\" called Rudolph, sharply.\n\nSome small but heavy object clattered on the floor. The urchin stooped,\nsnatched it up, and flung it hurtling clean over the garden to the\nriver. He turned, grinning amiably. \"Goo-moh? ning-seh. How too you\ntoo,\" he chanted. \"I am welly? glat to-see you.\" A boat-coolie, he\nexplained, had called this house bad names. He, Peng, threw stones.\nBad man.\n\n\"Out of here, you rascal!\" Rudolph flicked a riding-whip at the\nscampering legs, as the small defender of his honor bolted for\nthe stairs.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nHeywood appeared promptly at the door.\n\nFrom the road, below, a gleeful voice piped:--\n\n\"Goat-men! Baby-killers!\"\n\nIn the noon blaze, Peng skipped derisively, jeered at them, performed a\nbrief but indecorous pantomime, and then, kicking up his heels with joy,\nscurried for his life.\n\n\"Chucked his billet,\" said Heywood, without surprise. \"Little devil, I\nalways thought--What's missing?\"\n\nRudolph scanned his meagre belongings, rummaged his dressing-table,\nopened a wardrobe.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he answered. \"A boat-coolie--\"\n\nBut Heywood had darted to the rack of Mausers, knelt, and sprung up,\nraging.\n\n\"Side-bolts! Man,\" he cried, in a voice that made Rudolph jump,--\"man,\nwhy didn't you stop him? The side-bolts, all but two.--Young heathen,\nhe's crippled us: one pair of rifles left.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nOFF DUTY\n\nThe last of the sunlight streamed level through a gap in the western\nridges. It melted, with sinuous, tender shadows, the dry contour of\nfield and knoll, and poured over all the parching land a liquid,\nundulating grace. Like the shadow of clouds on ripe corn, the red tiles\nof the village roofs patched the countryside. From the distant sea had\ncome a breath of air, cool enough to be felt with gratitude, yet so\nfaint as neither to disturb the dry pulsation of myriad insect-voices,\nnor to blur the square mirrors of distant rice-fields, still tropically\nblue or icy with reflected clouds.\n\nMiss Drake paused on the knoll, and looked about her.\n\n\"This remains the same, doesn't it, for all our troubles?\" she said;\nthen to herself, slowly, \"'It is a beauteous evening, calm and free.'\"\n\nHeywood made no pretense of following her look.\n\n\"'Dear Nun,'\" he blurted; \"no, how does it go again?--'dear child, that\nwalkest with me here--'\"\n\nThe girl started down the <DW72>, with the impatience of one whose mood\nis frustrated. The climate had robbed her cheeks of much color, but not,\nit seemed, of all.\n\n\"Your fault,\" said Heywood, impenitent. \"Merely to show you. I could\nquote, once.\"\n\n\"Aged Man!\" She laughed, as though glad of this turn. \"I like you better\nin prose. Go on, please, where we left off. What did you do then?\"\n\nHeywood's smile, half earnest, half mischievous, obediently faded.\n\n\"Oh, that! Why, then, of course, I discharged Rudolph's gatekeeper, put\na trusty of my own in his place, sent out to hire a diver, and turned\nall hands to hunting. 'Obviously,' as Gilly would say.--We picked up two\nside-bolts in the garden, by the wall, one in the mud outside, and three\nthe diver got in shallow water. Total recovered, six; plus two Peng had\nno time for, eight. We can ill spare four guns, though; and the affair\nshows they keep a beastly close watch.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Drake, absently; then drew a slow breath. \"Peng was the\nmost promising pupil we had.\"\n\n\"He was,\" stated her companion, \"a little, unmitigated, skipping,\norange-tawny goblin!\"\n\nShe made no reply. As they footed slowly along the winding path,\nFlounce, the fox-terrier, who had scouted among strange clumps of\nbamboo, now rejoined them briskly, cantering with her fore-legs\ndelicately stiff and joyful. Miss Drake stooped to pat her, saying:--\n\n\"Poor little dog. Little Foreign Dog!\" She rose with a sigh, to add\nincongruously, \"Oh, the things we dream beforehand, and then the things\nthat happen!\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Heywood looked at her keenly. \"Sometimes they're the\nsame.\"\n\nThe jealous terrier scored her dusty paws down his white drill, from\nknee to ankle, before he added:--\n\n\"You know how the Queen of Heaven won her divinity.\"\n\n\"Another,\" said the girl, \"of your heathen stories?\"\n\n\"Rather a pretty one,\" he retorted. \"It happened in a seaport, a good\nmany hundred miles up the coast. A poor girl lived there, with her\nmother, in a hut. One night a great gale blew, so that everybody was\nanxious. Three junks were out somewhere at sea, in that storm. The girl\nlay there in the dark. Her sweetheart on board, it would be in a Western\nstory; but these were only her friends, and kin, and townsmen, that were\nat stake. So she lay there in the hut, you see, and couldn't rest. And\nthen it seemed to her, in the dark, that she was swimming out through\nthe storm, out and out, and not in the least afraid. She had become\nlarger, and more powerful, somehow, than the rain, or the dark, or the\nwhole ocean; for when she came upon the junks tossing there, she took\none in each hand, the third in her mouth, and began to swim for home.\nJust retrieved 'em, you know. But then across the storm she heard her\nmother calling in the dark, and had to open her mouth to answer. So she\nlost that junk.\"\n\n\"Well, then her spirit was back in the hut. But next day the two junks\ncame in; the third one, never. And for that dream, she was made, after\nher death, the great and merciful Queen of Heaven.\"\n\nAs Heywood ended, they were entering a pastoral village, near the town,\nbut hidden low under great trees, ancient and widely gnarled.\n\n\"You told that,\" said Miss Drake, \"as though it had really happened.\"\n\n\"If you believe, these things have reality; if not, they have none.\" His\ngesture, as he repeated the native maxim, committed him to neither side.\n\nMiss Drake looked back toward the hills.\n\n\"Her dream was play, compared to--some.\"\n\n\"That,\" he answered, \"is abominably true.\"\n\nThe curt, significant tone made her glance at him quickly. In her dark\neyes there was no impatience, but only trouble.\n\n\"We do better,\" she said, \"when we are both busy.\"\n\nHe nodded, as though reluctantly agreeing, not so much to the words as\nto the silence which followed.\n\nThe evening peace, which lay on the fields and hills, had flooded even\nthe village streets. Without pause, without haste, the endless labor of\nthe day went on as quiet as a summer cloud. Meeting or overtaking,\ncoolies passed in single file, their bare feet slapping the enormous\nflags of antique, sunken granite, their twin baskets bobbing and\ncreaking to the rhythm of their wincing trot. The yellow muscles rippled\nstrongly over straining ribs, as with serious faces, and slant eyes\nintent on their path, they chanted in pairs the ageless refrain, the\ncall and answer which make burdens lighter:--\n\n\n\"O heh!--O ha?\n O ho ho!\n O heh!--O ha?\n O ho ho!\"\n\n\nFrom hidden places sounded the whir of a jade-cutter's wheel, a\ncobbler's rattle, or the clanging music of a forge. Yet everywhere the\nslow movements, the faded, tranquil colors,--dull blue garments, dusky\nred tiles, deep bronze-green foliage overhanging a vista of subdued\nwhite and gray,--consorted with the spindling shadows and low-streaming\nvesper light. Keepers of humble shops lounged in the open air with their\ngossips, smoking bright pipes of the Yunnan white copper, nodding and\nblinking gravely. Above them, no less courteous and placid, little\ndoorway shrines besought the Earth-God to lead the Giver of Wealth\nwithin. Sometimes, where a narrow lane gaped opposite a door, small\nstone lions sat grinning upon pillars, to scare away the Secret Arrow of\nmisfortune. But these rarely: the village seemed a happy place, favored\nof the Influences. In the grateful coolness men came and went, buying,\njoking, offering neighborly advice to chance-met people.\n\nA plump woman, who carried two tiny silver fish in an immense flat\nbasket, grinned at Miss Drake, and pointed roguishly.\n\n\"See the two boats going by!\" she called. \"Her feet are bigger than my\nGolden Lilies!\" And laughing, she wriggled her own dusty toes, strong,\nfree, and perfect in modeling.\n\nAn old, withered barber looked up from shaving a blue forehead, under a\ntree.\n\n\"Their women,\" he growled, \"are shameless, and walk everywhere!\"\n\nBut a stern man, bearing a palm-leaf fan and a lark in a cage, frowned\nhim down.\n\n\"She brought my son safe out of the Three Sicknesses,\" he declared.\n\"Mind your trade, Catcher of Lively Ones!\" Then bending over the cage,\nwith solicitude, he began gently to fan the lark. As Heywood and the\ngirl paused beside him, he glanced up, and smiled gravely. \"I give my\npet his airing,\" he said; and then, quickly but quietly, \"When you reach\nthe town, do not pass through the West Quarter. It is full of\nevil-minded persons. Their placards are posted.\"\n\nA shrill trio of naked boys came racing and squabbling, to offer\ngrasshoppers for sale.\n\n\"We have seen no placards,\" replied Heywood.\n\n\"You will to-morrow,\" said the owner of the lark, calmly; and squatting,\nbecame engrossed in poking a grasshopper between the brown, varnished\nsplints of the cage. \"Maker of Music, here is your evening rice.\"\n\nThe two companions passed on, with Flounce timidly at heel.\n\n\"You see,\" Heywood broke out. \"Warnings everywhere. Now please, won't\nyou listen to my advice? No telling when the next ship _will_ call, but\nwhen it does--\"\n\n\"I can't run away.\" She spoke as one clinging to a former answer. \"I\nmust stand by my dream, such as it used to be--and even such as it is.\"\n\nHe eyed her sadly, shook his head, and said no more. For a moment they\nhalted, where the path broadened on a market-place, part shade, part\nluminous with golden dust. A squad of lank boys, kicking miraculously\nwith flat upturned soles, kept a wicker ball shining in the air, as true\nand lively as a plaything on a fountain-jet. Beyond, their tiny juniors,\ngirls and boys knee-high, and fat tumbling babies in rainbow finery, all\nhand-locked and singing, turned their circle inside out and back again,\nin the dizzy graces of the \"Water Wheel.\" Other boys, and girls still\ntrousered and queued like boys, played at hopscotch, in and out among\nshoes that lay across the road. All traffic, even the steady trotting\ncoolies, fetched a lenient compass roundabout.\n\n\"Lucky Hand, Lucky Hand! Allow me to pass,\" begged a coffin-maker's man,\nbent under a plank. \"These Long-Life boards are heavy.\"\n\n\"Ho, Lame Chicken!\" called another, blocked by the hop-scotch. He was a\nbrown grass-cutter, who grinned, and fondled a smoky cloth that\nbuzzed--some tribe of wild bees, captured far afield. \"Ho, Lame Chicken!\nDo not bump me. They will sting.\"\n\nHe came through safely; for at the same moment the musical \"Cling-clank\"\nof a sweetmeat-seller's bell turned the game into a race. The way was\nclear, also, for a tiny, aged collector of paper, flying the gay flag of\nan \"Exalted Literary Society,\" and plodding, between two great baskets,\non his pious rounds. \"Revere and spare,\" he piped, at intervals,--\n\"revere and spare the Written Word!\"\n\nAll the bright picture lingered with the two alien wayfarers, long after\nthey had passed and the sun had withdrawn from their path. In the hoary\npeace of twilight,--\n\n\"What can _we_ do here?\" the girl cried abruptly. \"There--I never meant\nto say it. But it runs in my head all the time. I work and work, to keep\nit down. What can we do here?\"\n\nHeywood watched her face, set straight before them, and now more clearly\ncut in the failing light. Were there only pride in those fine and\nresolute lines, it might have been a face from some splendid coin, or\nmedal of victory.\n\n\"You work too hard,\" he said. \"Think, instead, of all the good--\"\n\nBut at that she seemed to wince.\n\n\"The good? As if there weren't dark streets and crooked children at\nhome! Oh, the pride and ignorance that sent me here!\" She spoke quietly,\nwith a kind of wonder. \"Just blind, ignorant feelings, I took them\nfor--for something too great and mysterious. It's all very strange to\nlook back on, and try to put into words. I remember painted glass, and\nsolemn music--and thinking--then!--that I knew this lovely and terrible\nworld--and its Maker and Master.\" She looked down the dusky lanes,\nwhere glowworm lanterns began to bob and wink. \"Oh, this land! where you\nsee the days running into years!\"\n\n\"The Dragon's a wise old beast,\" he ventured. \"He teaches--something.\"\n\nShe assented gravely:--\n\n\"And in those days I thought it was a dark continent--of lost souls.\"\n\n\"There are no dark continents,\" declared Heywood suddenly, in a broken\nvoice. \"The heart of one man--can hold more darkness--You would never\nsee into it--\"\n\n\"Don't!\" she cried sharply. \"What did we promise?\"\n\nThey stood close in the dusk, and a tremor, a wave, passed through them\nboth.\n\n\"I forgot--I couldn't help\"--he stammered; then, as they stumbled\nforward, he regained his former tone, keen and ready. \"Mustn't get to\nfussing about our work, must we?--Curious thing: speaking of dreams, you\nknow. The other night I thought you were somewhere out on board a junk,\nand Flounce with you. I swam like anything, miles and miles, but\ncouldn't get out to you. Worked like steam, and no headway. Flounce knew\nI was coming, but you didn't. Deuced odd, how real it seemed.\"\n\nShe laughed, as though they had walked past some danger.\n\n\"And speaking of dragons,\" she rejoined. \"They _do_ help. The man in\nthe story, that dipped in dragon's blood, was made invulnerable.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" He stood plainly at a loss. \"Oh, I see. German, wasn't he?--Pity\nthey didn't pop Rudie Hackh in!\"\n\nHer swift upward glance might have been admiration, if she had not\nsaid:--\n\n\"Your mind works very slowly.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Again he paused, as though somewhat hurt; then answered\ncheerfully: \"Dare say. Always did. Thought at first you meant the\nrattan-juice kind, from Sumatra.\"\n\nThe gate of the town yawned black. From the streets glimmered a few\nlanterns, like candles in a long cave. But shunning these unfriendly\ncorridors, he led her roundabout, now along the walls, now through the\ndim ways of an outlying hamlet. A prolonged shriek of growing fright and\nanguish came slowly toward them--the cry of a wheelbarrow carrying the\ngreat carcass of a pig, waxy white and waxy red, like an image from a\nchamber of horrors. In the blue twilight, fast deepening, the most\nfamiliar things became grotesque. A woman's voice telling stories behind\nshadow pictures, and the capricious play of the black puppets on her\nlighted screen, had the effect of incantation. Before the booth of a\ndentist, the long strings of black teeth swayed in the lantern-glow,\nrattling, like horrid necklaces of cannibals. And from a squat\nden--where on a translucent placard in the dull window flickered the\nwords \"Foreign Earth,\" and the guttering door-lantern hinted \"As You\nLike It\"--there came a sweet, insidious, potent smell that seemed more\npoisonous than mere opium.\n\n\"Let's go faster,\" said the girl. \"Somehow, the dark makes me uneasy\nto-night.\"\n\nSkirting the town, they struck at last the open road beyond, and saw\nagainst a fading sky the low black bulk of the nunnery, pierced with\norange squares. Past its landward wall, lanterns moved slowly, clustered\nhere and there by twos and threes, and dispersed. Cackling argument came\nfrom the ditch, wherever the lantern-bearers halted; and on the face of\nthe wall, among elbowing shadows, shone dim strips of scarlet. Both\npillars of the gate were plastered with them.\n\n\"Placards,\" said Heywood. \"Things are ripening fast.\" Lighting match\nfrom match, he studied the long red scrolls, crowded with neat rows of\nsymbols. He read them off slowly.\n\n'The Garden of the Three Exquisites.'--Pshaw! that's a theatre notice:\nenterprising manager.--Ah, more like it. Long preamble, regular\ntrimetrical platitudes--here we are:--\n\n\"'These Red-Bristled Ghosts teach their dupes to break the ancestral\ntablets, and to worship the picture of a naked infant, which points one\nfinger toward heaven, another toward earth.--To each man entering the\nFalse Religion, a pill is given which confuses and darkens the\nmind.--Why they dig out babies' eyes: from one hundred pounds of Chinese\nlead can be extracted seven pounds of silver, and the remaining\nninety-three pounds can be sold at the original cost. This silver can be\nextracted only by the elixir of black eyes. The green eyes of barbarians\nare of no use.'--Really, what follows is too--er--obscure. But here's\nthe close: 'Tao-tais of the villages, assemble your population.\nPatriots, join! Let us hurl back these wizard-beasts beyond the oceans,\nto take their place among the strange things of creation!'\"\n\n\"And the big characters,\" she added, \"the big characters you tried to\nhide, are 'Kill' and 'Burn'?\"\n\nGray eyes and dark eyes met steadily, while the last match, reddening\nthe blood in his fingers, slowly burned out.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nKAU FAI\n\nAt the top of the nunnery stairs, Rudolph met them with awkward\nceremony, and with that smiling air of encouragement which a nurse might\nuse in trying cheerfully to deceive a sick man. Heywood laughed, without\nmercy, at this pious fraud.\n\n\"Hallo, you Red-Bristled Ghost!\" he cried. \"We came early--straight from\nour walk. Are the rest coming? And did my cook arrive to help yours?\"\n\nTheir host, carried by assault, at once became less mournful.\n\n\"The cook is here,\" he replied, \"by the kitchen-sounds. They disagree, I\nthink. I have asked everybody. We should have a full dinner-table.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said his friend; and then whispering, as they followed Miss\nDrake to the living-room, \"I say, don't act as though you expected the\nghost of Banquo.\"\n\nIn the bare, white loft, by candle-light, Sturgeon sat midway in some\nlong and wheezy tale, to which the padre and his wife listened with true\nforbearance. Greetings over, the stodgy annalist continued. The story\nwas forgotten as soon as ended; talk languished; and even by the quaking\nlight of the candles, it was plain that the silence was no mere waiting\nsolemnity before meat, but a period of tension.\n\nThe relief came oddly. Up from the road sounded a hubbub of voices, the\ntramp of feet, and loud halloos.\n\n\"By Jove!\" cried Sturgeon, like a man who fears the worst; and for all\nhis bulk, he was first at the window.\n\nA straggling file of lanterns, borne by some small army, came jogging\nand crowding to a halt under the walls. Yellow faces gleamed faintly,\nbare heads bobbed, and men set down burdens, grunting. Among the\nvanguard an angry voice scolded in a strange tongue. \"_Burra suar!_\" it\nraged; then hailed imperiously, \"_Ko hai?_\"\n\nWhere the lanterns clustered brightest, an active little figure in white\nwaved a helmet, crying,--\n\n\"On deck! Where the devil does Maurice Heywood live?\"\n\n\"I'm up here,\" called that young man.\n\nFor reply, the stranger began to skip among his cohorts, jerking out his\nwhite legs like a dancing marionette. Then, with a sudden drop-kick, he\nsent the helmet flickering high into the darkness over the wall.\n\n\"Here we come!\" he shouted, in hilarious warning. The squabbling\nretinue surged after him through the gate, and one by one the lanterns\ndisappeared under the covered way.\n\n\"It's the captain!\" laughed Heywood, in amazement. \"Kneebone--ashore! He\ncan't be sober!\"\n\nAll stared; for Captain Kneebone, after one historically brief and\noutspoken visit, had never in all these years set foot in the port. The\ntwo young men hurried to the stairs.\n\nChinamen and lanterns crowded the courtyard, stuffed the passage, and\nstill came straggling in at the gate. By the noise and clatter, it might\nhave been a caravan, or a band of half-naked robbers bringing plunder.\nEverywhere, on the stone flags, coolies were dumping down bundles,\nboxes, jute-bags crammed with heavy objects. Among them, still brawling\nin bad Hindustani, the little captain gave his orders. At sight of\nHeywood, however, he began once more to caper, with extravagant\ngrimaces. By his smooth, ruddy face, and tunic of purest white, he\nseemed a runaway parson gone farther wrong than ever.\n\n\"I've come to stay a month!\" he cried; and dancing up, caught Heywood's\nhands and whirled him about. \"I was fair bursting to see ye, my boy! And\nhere we are, at last!\"\n\nThough his cheeks were flushed, and eyes alarmingly bright, he was\nbeyond question sober. Over his head, Heywood and Rudolph exchanged an\nanxious glance.\n\n\"Good! but this is Hackh's house--the nunnery,\" said the one; and the\nother added, \"You're just in time for dinner.\"\n\nThe captain found these facts to be excruciating. He clapped Rudolph on\nthe arm, and crowed:--\n\n\"Nunnery? We'll make it a bloomin' chummery!--Dinner be 'anged! A\nbanquet. What's more, I've brought the chow\"--he swept the huddled boxes\nwith a prodigal gesture,--\"lashin's o' food and drink! That's what it\nis: a banquet!\"\n\nHe turned again to his sweating followers, and flung the head coolie a\nhandful of silver, crying, \"_Sub-log kiswasti!_ Divide, and be off with\nye! _Jao_, ye beggars! Not a pice more. Finish! I'll not spend it all on\n_you_!\" Then, pouncing on the nearest crate, he burst it open with a\nferocious kick. \"Stores? The choicest to be 'ad in all Saigong! Look\nhere\"--He held up a tin and scanned the label triumphantly: \"Chow de\nBruxelles, what? Never saw chow spelt with an 'x' before, did ye?\nFrench, my boy. Bad spellers, but good cooks, are the French.\"\n\nHeywood lost his worried frown. Something had happened,--evidently at\nCalcutta, for the captain always picked up his vernacular where he\ndropped his latest cargo; but at all events these vagaries were not the\neffect of heat or loneliness.\n\n\"What's up, Captain?\" he laughed.\n\nBut now that the coolies had gone, Captain Kneebone's heels were busy,\nstaving open boxes right and left. A bottle rolled out, and smashed in a\nhissing froth of champagne.\n\n\"Plenty more,\" he cried, rejoicing. \"That shows ye how much _I_ care!\nOho!\" Suddenly he turned from this destruction, and facing Heywood,\nbegan mysteriously to exult over him. \"Old fool and his earnings, eh?\nFixed ideas, eh? 'No good,' says you. 'That cock won't fight,' says you.\n'Let it alone.'--Ho-ho! What price fixed ideas now?\"\n\nThe eyes of his young friend widened in unbelief.\n\n\"No,\" he cried, with a start: \"you haven't?\"\n\nThe captain seized both hands again, and took on--for his height--a\nRoman stateliness.\n\n\"I have.\" He nodded solemnly. \"Bar sells, I have. No more, now.\nWe'll--be-George, we'll announce it, at the banquet! Announce, that's\nthe word. First time in _my_ life: announce!\"\n\nHeywood suddenly collapsed on a sack, and laughed himself into abject\nsilence.\n\n\"Awfully glad, old chap,\" he at last contrived to say, and again\nchoked. The captain looked down at the shaking body with a singular,\nbenign, and fatherly smile.\n\n\"A funny world, ain't it?\" he declared sagely. \"I've known this boy a\nlong time,\" he explained to Rudolph. \"This matter's--We'll let you in,\npresently. Lend me some coolies here, while we turn your dinner into my\nbanquet. Eh? You don't care? Once in a bloomin' lifetime.\"\n\nWith a seafaring bellow, he helped Rudolph to hail the servants'\nquarters. A pair of cooks, a pair of Number Twos, and all the\n\"learn-pidgin\" youngsters of two households came shuffling into the\ncourt; and arriving guests found all hands broaching cargo, in a loud\nconfusion of orders and miscomprehension.\n\nThe captain's dinner was the more brilliant. Throughout the long, white\nroom, in the slow breeze of the punkah, scores of candles burned soft\nand tremulous, as though the old days had returned when the brown\nsisters lighted their refectory; but never had their table seen such\nprofusion of viands, or of talk and laughter. The Saigon stores--after\ndaily fare--seemed of a strange and Corinthian luxury. The captain's\nwine proved excellent. And his ruddy little face, beaming at the head of\nthe table, wore an extravagant, infectious grin. His quick blue eyes\ndanced with the light of some ineffable joke. He seemed a conjurer,\ncreating banquets for sheer mischief in the wilderness.\n\n\"There's a soup!\" he had proclaimed. \"Patent, mind ye! Stick a knife\ninto the tin, and she 'eats 'erself!\"\n\nAmong all the revelers, one face alone showed melancholy. Chantel, at\nthe foot of the table, sat unregarded by all save Rudolph, who now and\nthen caught from him a look filled with gloom and suspicion. It was\nbeside Rudolph that Mrs. Forrester laughed and chattered, calling all\neyes toward her, and yet finding private intervals in which to dart a\nsidelong shaft at her neighbor. Rudolph's ears shone coral pink; for now\nagain he was aboard ship, hiding a secret at once dizzy, dangerous, and\nentrancing. Across the talk, the wine, the many lights, came the triumph\nof seeing that other hostile face, glowering in defeat. Never before had\nChantel, and all the others, dwindled so far into such nonentity, or her\npresence vibrated so near.\n\nSoon he became aware that Captain Kneebone had risen, with a face\nglowing red above the candles. Even Sturgeon forgot the flood of\nbounties, and looked expectantly toward their source. The captain\ncleared his throat, faltered, then turning sheepish all at once,\nhung his head.\n\n\"Be 'anged, I can't make a speech, after all,\" he grumbled; and\nwheeling suddenly on Heywood, with a peevish air of having been\ndefrauded: \"Aboard ship I could sit and think up no end o' flowery talk,\nand now it's all gone!\"\n\nHe stared at his plate miserably. It was Miss Drake who came to his\nrescue.\n\n\"Tell us the secret,\" she begged. \"How do you manage all these nice\nthings?\"\n\nThe captain's eyes surveyed the motley collection down the length of the\nbright table, then returned to her, gratefully:--\n\n\"This ain't anything. Only a little--bloomin'--\"\n\n\"Impromptu,\" suggested Heywood.\n\n\"That's the word!\" Captain Kneebone eyed them both with uncommon favor.\n\"That's it, ye know. I just 'opped about Saigong like a--jackdaw,\npicking up these impromptus. But I came here all the way to break the\nnews proper, by word o' mouth.\"\n\nHe faced the company, and gathering himself for the effort,--\n\n\"I'm rich,\" he declared. \"I'm da--I'm remarkable rich.\"\n\nPausing for the effect, he warmed to his oratory.\n\n\"It ain't for me to boast. Sailormen as a rule are bad hands to save\nmoney. But I've won first prize in the Derby Sweepstake Lott'ry, and the\nmoney's safe to my credit at the H.K. and S. in Calcutta, and I'm\nretired and going Home! More money than the old Kut Sing earned since\nher launching--so much I was frightened, first, and lost my sleep! And\nme without chick nor child, as the saying is--to go Home and live\nluxurious ever after!\"\n\n\"Ow!\" cried Nesbit, \"lucky beggar!\"--\"Sincerely glad,\" said Mr.\nForrester. And a volley of compliments went round the board. The captain\nplainly took heart, and flushing still redder at so much praise and good\nwill, stood now at ease, chuckling.\n\n\"Most men,\" he began, when there came a lull, \"most men makes a will\nafter they're dead. That's a shore way o' doing things! Now _I_ want to\nsee the effects, living. So be 'anged, here goes, right and proper. To\nMiss Drake, for her hospital and kiddies, two thousand rupees.\"\n\nIn the laughter and friendly uproar, the girl sat dazed.\n\n\"What shall I say?\" she whispered, wavering between amusement and\ndistress. \"I can't accept it--\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" grumbled Heywood, with an angry glance. \"Don't spoil the\nhappiest evening of an old man's life.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" she answered quickly; and when the plaudits ended, she\nthanked the captain in a very simple, pretty speech, which made him\nduck and grin,--a proud little benefactor.\n\n\"That ain't all,\" he cried gayly; then leveled a threatening finger,\nlike a pistol, at her neighbor. \"Who poked fun at me, first and last?\nWho always came out aboard to tell me what an old ass I was? Fixed\nideas, eh? No go?--Look you here. What did I come so many hundred miles\nfor? To say what I always said: half-shares.\" The light-blue eyes, keen\nwith sea-cunning and the lonely sight of many far horizons, suffered an\nindescribable change. \"My boy, the half's yours. There's two rich men\nhere to-night. I've come to take you Home.\"\n\nIt was Heywood's turn to be struck dumb. He grew very pale.\n\n\"Oh, I say,\" he stammered at last, \"it's not fair--\"\n\n\"Don't spoil the happiest evening--\" whispered the girl beside him.\n\nHe eyed her ruefully, groaned, then springing up, went swiftly to the\nhead of the table and wrung the captain's brown paw, without a word\nto say.\n\n\"Can do, can do,\" said Captain Kneebone, curtly. \"I was afraid ye might\nnot want to come.\"\n\nThen followed a whirlwind; and Teppich rose with his moustache\nbristling, and the ready Nesbit jerked him down again in the opening\nsentence; and everybody laughed at Heywood, who sat there so white,\nwith such large eyes; and the dinner going by on the wings of night, the\nmelancholy \"boy\" circled the table, all too soon, with a new silver\ncasket full of noble cigars from Paiacombo, Manila, and Dindigul.\n\nAs the three ladies passed the foot of the table, Rudolph saw Mrs.\nForrester make an angry signal. And presently, like a prisoner going to\nhis judge, Chantel slipped out of the room. He was not missed; for\nalready the streaming candle-flames stood wreathed in blue layers, nor\nwas it long before the captain, mounting his chair, held a full\nglass aloft.\n\n\"Here,\" he cried in triumph, \"here's to every nail in the hoof--\"\n\nThe glass crashed into splinters and froth. A flying stone struck the\nboom of the punkah, and thumped on the table. Through the open windows,\nfrom the road, came a wild chorus of yells, caught up and echoed by many\nvoices in the distance.\n\n\"Shutters!\" called Heywood. \"Quick!\"\n\nAs they slammed them home, more stones drummed on the boards and\nclattered against the wall. Conches brayed somewhere, followed by an\nunaccountable, sputtering fusillade as of tiny muskets, and then by a\nformidable silence. While the banqueters listened in the smoky room,\nthere came a sullen, heavy sound, like a single stroke on a large and\nvery slack bass-drum.\n\n\"_Kau fai!_\" shrilled the voices below; and then in a fainter gabble, as\nthough hurrying off toward the sound,--\"_kau fai!_\"\n\n\"The Black Dog,\" said Heywood, quietly. \"He has barked. Earlier than we\nfigured, Gilly. Lucky the scaffolding's up. Gentlemen, we all know our\nposts. Guns are in the first bedroom. Quietly, now. Rudie, go call\nChantel. Don't frighten the women. If they ask about that noise, tell\n'em anything--Dragon Boat Festival beginning. Anything.--We can easily\nhold this place, while the captain gets 'em out to his ship.\"\n\nThe captain wheeled, with an injured air.\n\n\"What ship?\" he inquired testily. \"Told ye, plain, I was retired. Came\nthe last bit in a stinking native boat, and _she's_ cleared by now.\nThink I carry ships in my pocket?\"\n\nOutside, the swollen discord of shouts, thunder of gongs, and hoarse\ncalling of the conches came slowly nearer, extending through\nthe darkness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nTHE GUNWALE\n\nRudolph's mission began quietly, with a glimpse which he afterward\nrecalled as incredibly peaceful. Two of the women, at least, showed no\nfear. In the living-room sat Mrs. Earle, her chin cramped on her high\nbosom, while she mournfully studied his  picture-book of the\nRhine. Miss Drake, who leaned in one of the river windows, answered him,\nsaying rather coldly that Chantel and Mrs. Forrester had gone down to\nthe garden.\n\nIn the court, however, he ran across Ah Pat, loitering beside a lantern.\nThe compradore grinned, and in a tone of great unconcern called out that\nthe pair were not in the garden. \"Walkee so.\" He pointed down the\npassage to the main gate, and hooked his thumb toward the right, to\nindicate their course. \"Makee finish, makee die now,\" he added calmly;\n\"too muchee, no can.\"\n\nRudolph experienced his first shock of terror, like an icy blow on the\nscalp. They had gone outside before the alarm; she, Bertha, was swept\naway in that tumult which came raging through the darkness.--He stood\ntransfixed, but only for an instant, rather by the stroke of\nhelplessness than by fear; and then, blindly, without plan or foresight,\ndarted down the covered way. The tiny flame of a pith wick, floating in\na saucer of oil, showed Heywood's gatekeeper sitting at his post, like a\ngnome in the gallery of a mine. Rudolph tore away the bar, heard the\nheavy gate slam shut, and found himself running down the starlit road.\n\nNot all starlight, however; a dim red glow began to flicker on the\nshapes which rushed behind him in his flight. Wheeling once, he saw two\nbroad flames leaping high in wild and splendid rivalry,--one from\nHeywood's house, one from the club. He caught also a whirling impression\nof many heads and arms, far off, tiny, black, and crowded in rushing\ndisorder; of pale torches in the road; and of a hissing, snarling shout,\na single word, like \"_Sha, sha_!\" repeated incessantly in a high key.\nThe flame at the club shot up threefold, with a crash; and a glorious\ncriss-cross multitude of sparks flew hissing through the treetops, like\nfiery tadpoles through a net.\n\nHe turned and ran on, dazzled; fell over some one who lay groaning; rose\non hands and knees, groped in the dust, and suddenly fingered thin,\nrough cloth, warm and sopping. In a nausea of relief, he felt that this\nwas a native,--some unknown dying man, who coughed like a drunkard.\n\nRudolph sprang up and raced again, following by habit the path which he\nand she had traversed at noon. Once, with a heavy collision, he stopped\nshort violently in the midst of crowded men, who shouted, clung to him,\nwrestling, and struck out with something sharp that ripped his tunic. He\nkicked, shook them off, hammered his fists right and left, and ran free,\nwith a strange conviction that to-night he was invincible. Stranger\nstill, as the bamboo leaves now and then brushed his bare forehead, he\nmissed the sharp music of her cicadas.\n\nThe looming of a wall checked him. Here stood her house; she had the\nbriefest possible start of him, and he had run headlong the whole way;\nby all the certainty of instinct, he knew that he had chosen the right\npath: why, then, had he not overtaken her? If she met that band which he\nhad just broken through--He wavered in the darkness, and was turning\nwildly to race back, when a sudden light sprang up before him in her\nwindow. He plunged forward, in at the gate, across a plot of turf,\nstumbled through the Goddess of Mercy bamboo that hedged the door, and\nwent falling up the dark stairs, crying aloud,--for the first time in\nhis life,--\"Bertha! Bertha!\"\n\nEmpty rooms rang with the name, but no one answered. At last, however,\nreaching the upper level, he saw by lamplight, through the open door,\ntwo figures struggling. Just before he entered, she tore herself free\nand went unsteadily across the room. Chantel, white and abject, turned\nas in panic.\n\n\"Oh!\" Plainly he had not expected to see another face as white as his\nown. Breathless and trembling, he spoke in a strangely little voice; but\nhis staring eyes lighted with a sudden and desperate resolution. \"Help\nme with her,\" he begged. \"She won't listen. The woman's out of\nher wits.\"\n\nHe caught Rudolph by the arm; and standing for a moment like close\nfriends, the two panting rivals watched her in stupefaction. She\nransacked a great cedar chest, a table, shelves, boxes, and strewed the\ncontents on the floor,--silk scarfs, shining Benares brass, Chinese\nsilver, vivid sarongs from the Preanger regency, Kyoto cloisonne, a wild\nheap of plunder from the bazaars of all the nations where Gilly's meagre\nearnings had been squandered. A Cingalese box dropped and burst open,\nscattering bright stones, false or precious, broadcast. She trampled\nthem in her blind and furious search.\n\n\"Come,\" said Chantel, and snatched at her. \"Leave those. Come to the\nboat. Every minute--\"\n\nShe pushed him aside like a thing without weight or meaning, stooped\nagain among the gay rubbish, caught up a necklace, flung it down for\nthe sake of a brooch, then dropped everything and turned with blank,\ndilated eyes, and the face of a child lost in a crowd.\n\n\"Rudolph,\" she whimpered, \"help me. What shall I do?\"\n\nWithout waiting for answer, she bent once more to sort and discard her\npitiful treasures, to pause vaguely, consider, and wring her hands.\nRudolph, in his turn, caught her by the arm, but fared no better.\n\n\"We must humor her,\" whispered Chantel, and, kneeling like a peddler\namong the bazaar-stuffs, spread on the floor a Java sarong, blue and\nbrown, painted with men and buffaloes. On this he began to heap things\npell-mell.\n\nThe woman surrendered, and all at once flung her arms about Rudolph,\nhiding her face, and clinging to him as if with the last of\nher strength.\n\n\"Come, he'll bring them,\" she sobbed. \"Let's go--to the boat. He must\nfind his own way. Take me.\" Hurry and fright choked her. \"Take me--leave\nhim, if he won't come--I scolded him--then the noises came, and\nwe ran--\"\n\n\"What boat?\" said Rudolph.\n\nChantel did not look up.\n\n\"I have one ready and stocked,\" he mumbled, tugging with his teeth at\nthe knot in the sarong corners. \"You can come. We'll drop down the\nriver, and try it along the coast. Only chance. Come on.\"\n\nHe rose, and started for the door, slinging the bright- bundle\nover his shoulder. \"Come on,\" he snarled. Against the gay pattern, his\nhandsome pirate face shone brown and evil in the lamplight. \"Damn you,\nI've waited long enough for your whims. Stay there and be killed, then.\"\n\nHe ran to the stairs, and down. The woman's arms began to drag loosely,\nas if she were slipping to the floor; then suddenly, with a cry, she\nturned and bolted. Run as he might, Rudolph did not overtake her till\nshe had caught Chantel at the gate. All three, silent, sped across\nfields toward the river, through the startling shadows and dim orange\nglow from distant flames.\n\nThe rough ground sloped, at last, and sent them stumbling down into mud.\nBehind them the bank ran black and ragged against the glow; before them,\nstill more black, lay the river, placid, mysterious, and safe. Through\nthe mud they labored heavily toward a little, smoky light--a lantern\ngleaming faintly on a polished gunwale, the shoulders of a man, and the\nthin, slant line that was his pole.\n\n\"Lowdah?\" called Chantel; and the shoulders moved, the line shifted, as\nthe boatman answered. Chantel pitched the bundle over the lantern, and\nleapt on board. Rudolph came slowly, carrying in his arms the woman,\nwho lay quiet and limp, clasping him in a kind of drowsy oblivion. He\nfelt the flutter of her lips, while she whispered in his ear strange,\nbreathless entreaties, a broken murmur of endearments, unheard-of, which\ntempted him more than the wide, alluring darkness of the river.\n\nHe lowered her slowly; and leaning against the gunwale, she still clung\nto his hands.\n\n\"Aboard! Quickly!\" snapped their leader, from the dusk behind the\nlantern.\n\nObeying by impulse, Rudolph moved nearer the gunwale. The slippery edge,\npolished by bare feet through many years, seemed the one bit of reality\nin this dream, except the warmth of her hands.\n\n\"To the nunnery?\" he asked, trying dully to rouse from a fascination.\n\n\"No, no,\" she wailed. \"Down--away--safe.\"\n\n\"No, back to them,\" he answered stupidly. \"They are all there. Your--he\nis there. We can't leave--\"\n\n\"You fool!\" Chantel swore in one tongue, and in another cried to the\nboatman--\"Shove off, if they won't come!\" He seized the woman roughly\nand pulled her on board; but she reached out and caught Rudolph's\nhand again.\n\n\"Come, hurry,\" she whispered, tugging at him. \"Come, dear boy. I won't\nleave you. Quickly. You saw it burning. They're all dead. It's no use.\nWe must live. We must live, darling.\"\n\nShe was right, somehow; there was no power to confute her. He must come\nwith her, or run back, useless, into the ring of swords and flames. She\nand life were in the boat; ashore, a friend cut off beyond reach, an\nimpossible duty, and death. His eyes, dull and fixed in the smoky\nlantern-light, rested for an age on the knotted sarong. It meant\nnothing; then in a flash, as though for him all light of the eyes had\nconcentrated in a single vision, it meant everything. The \ncloth--rudely painted in the hut of some forgotten mountaineer--held\nall her treasure and her heart, the things of this world. She must go\nwith those. It was fitting. She was beautiful--in all her fear and\ndisorder, still more beautiful. She went with life, departing into a\ndream. This glossy gunwale, polished by bare feet, was after all the\nsole reality, a shining line between life and death.\n\n\"Then I must die,\" he groaned, and wrenched his hands away from that\nperilous boundary.\n\nHe vaguely heard her cry out, vaguely saw Chantel rise above the lantern\nand slash down at him with the lowdah's pole. The bamboo struck him,\nheavy but glancing, on the head. He staggered, lost his footing, and\nfell into the mud, where, as though his choice had already overtaken\nhim, he lay without thought or emotion, watching the dim light float off\ninto the darkness.\n\nBy and by it was gone. From somewhere in another direction came a sharp,\ncontinual, crackling fusillade, like the snapping of dry bamboo-joints\nin a fire. The unstirring night grew heavier with the smell of burnt\ngunpowder. But Rudolph, sitting in the mud, felt only that his eyes were\ndry and leaden in their sockets, that there was a drumming in his ears,\nand that if heat and weariness thus made an end of him, he need no\nlonger watch the oppressive multitude of stars, or hear the monotony of\nflowing water.\n\nSomething stirred in the dry grass above him. Without turning, he heard\na man scramble down the bank; without looking up, he felt some one pause\nand stoop close. When at last, in profound apathy, he raised his eyes,\nhe saw against the starlight the hat, head, and shoulders of a coolie.\n\nQuite natural, he thought, that the fellow should be muttering in\nGerman. It was only the halting, rusty fashion of the speech that\nfinally fretted him into listening. The words did not concern him.\n\n\"Are you dead, then?\" grumbled the coolie. \"Did she kill you?\"\n\nRudolph dismissed him with a vague but angry motion.\n\nSome time afterward the same voice came louder. The coolie was still\nthere.\n\n\"You cannot sit here all night,\" he said. \"By daylight they will catch\nyou. Come. Perhaps I can take you to your friends. Come.\"\n\nRudolph felt sharp knuckles working at his lips, and before he could\nrebel, found his mouth full of sweet fiery liquid. He choked, swallowed,\nand presently heard the empty bottle splash in the river.\n\n\"_Stoesst an_!\" said the rescuer, and chuckled something in dispraise of\nwomen. \"Is that not better?\"\n\nThe rice-brandy was hot and potent; for of a sudden Rudolph found\nhimself afoot and awake. A dizzy warmth cleared his spirit. He\nunderstood perfectly. This man, for some strange reason, was Wutzler, a\ncoolie and yet a brother from the fatherland. He and his nauseous alien\nbrandy had restored the future. There was more to do.\n\n\"Come on.\" The forsaken lover was first man up the bank. \"See!\" he\ncried, pointing to a new flare in the distance. The whole region was now\naglow like a furnace, and filled with smoke, with prolonged yells, and a\ncontinuity of explosions that ripped the night air like tearing silk.\n\"Her house is burning now.\"\n\n\"You left in time.\" Wutzler shuffled before him, with the trot of a\nlean and exhausted laborer. \"I was with the men you fought, when you\nran. I followed to the house, and then here, to the river. I was glad\nyou did not jump on board.\" He glanced back, timidly, for approbation.\n\"I am a great coward, Herr Heywood told me so,--but I also stay\nand help.\"\n\nHe steered craftily among the longest and blackest shadows, now jogging\nin a path, now threading the boundary of a rice-field, or waiting behind\ntrees; and all the time, though devious and artful as a deer-stalker,\ncrept toward the centre of the noise and the leaping flames. When the\nquaking shadows grew thin and spare, and the lighted clearings\ndangerously wide, he swerved to the right through a rolling bank of\nsmoke. They coughed as they ran.\n\nOnce Rudolph paused, with the heat of the fire on his cheeks.\n\n\"The nunnery is burning,\" he said hopelessly.\n\nHis guide halted, peered shrewdly, and listened.\n\n\"No, they are still shooting,\" he answered, and limped onward, skirting\nthe uproar.\n\nAt last, when by pale stars above the smoke and flame and sparks,\nRudolph judged that they were somewhere north of the nunnery, they came\nstumbling down into a hollow encumbered with round, swollen obstacles.\nLike a patch of enormous melons, oil-jars lay scattered.\n\n\"Hide here, and wait,\" commanded Wutzler. \"I will go see.\" And he\nflitted off through the smoke.\n\nSmuggled among the oil-jars, Rudolph lay panting. Shapes of men ran\npast, another empty jar rolled down beside him, and a stray bullet sang\noverhead like a vibrating wire. Soon afterward, Wutzler came crawling\nthrough the huddled pottery.\n\n\"Lie still,\" he whispered. \"Your friends are hemmed in. You cannot get\nthrough.\"\n\nThe smell of rancid oil choked them, yet they could breathe without\ncoughing, and could rest their smarting eyes. In the midst of tumult and\ncombustion, the hollow lay dark as a pool. Along its rim bristled a\nscrubby fringe of weeds, black against a rosy cloud.\n\nAfter a time, something still blacker parted the weeds. In silhouette, a\nman's head, his hand grasping a staff or the muzzle of a gun, remained\nthere as still as though, crawling to the verge, he lay petrified in the\nact of spying.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nLAMP OF HEAVEN\n\nThe white men peered from among the oil-jars, like two of the Forty\nThieves. They could detect no movement, friendly or hostile: the black\nhead lodged there without stirring. The watcher, whether he had seen\nthem or not, was in no hurry; for with chin propped among the weeds, he\nheld a pose at once alert and peaceful, mischievous and leisurely, as\nthough he were master of that hollow, and might lie all night drowsing\nor waking, as the humor prompted.\n\nWutzler pressed his face against the earth, and shivered in the stifling\nheat. The uncertainty grew, with Rudolph, into an acute distress. His\nlegs ached and twitched, the bones of his neck were stretched as if to\nbreak, and a corner of broken clay bored sharply between his ribs. He\nfelt no fear, however: only a great impatience to have the spy\nbegin,--rise, beckon, call to his fellows, fire his gun, hit or miss.\n\nThis longing, or a flash of anger, or the rice-brandy working so nimbly\nin his wits, gave him both impulse and plan.\n\n\"Don't move,\" he whispered; \"wait here.\" And wriggling backward, inch\nby inch, feet foremost among the crowded bellies of the jars, he gained\nthe further darkness. So far as sight would carry, the head stirred no\nmore than if it had been a cannon-ball planted there on the verge,\nagainst the rosy cloud. From crawling, Rudolph rose to hands and knees,\nand silently in the dust began to creep on a long circuit. Once, through\na rift in smoke, he saw a band of yellow musketeers, who crouched behind\nsome ragged earthwork or broken wall, loading and firing without pause\nor care, chattering like outraged monkeys, and all too busy to spare a\nglance behind. Their heads bobbed up and down in queer scarlet turbans\nor scarfs, like the flannel nightcaps of so many diabolic invalids.\n\nPassing them unseen, he crept back toward his hollow. In spite of smoke,\nhe had gauged and held his circle nicely, for straight ahead lay the\nman's legs. Taken thus in the rear, he still lay prone, staring down the\n<DW72>, inactive; yet legs, body, and the bent arm that clutched a musket\nbeside him in the grass, were stiff with some curious excitement. He\nseemed ready to spring up and fire.\n\nNo time to lose, thought Rudolph; and rising, measured his distance with\na painful, giddy exactness. He would have counted to himself before\nleaping, but his throat was too dry. He flinched a little, then shot\nthrough the air, and landed heavily, one knee on each side, pinning the\nfellow down as he grappled underneath for the throat. Almost in the same\nmovement he had bounded on foot again, holding both hands above his\nhead, as high as he could withdraw them. The body among the weeds lay\ncold, revoltingly indifferent to stratagem or violence, in the same\ntense attitude, which had nothing to do with life.\n\nRudolph dropped his hands, and stood confounded by his own brutal\ndiscourtesy. Wutzler, crawling out from the jars, scrambled joyfully\nup the bank.\n\n\"You have killed him?\" quavered the dry little voice. \"You are very\nbrave!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Rudolph, earnestly. \"He was, already.\"\n\nBy the scarlet headgear, and a white symbol on the back of his jacket,\nthe man at their feet was one of the musketeers. He had left the\nfiring-line, crawled away in the dark, and found a quiet spot to die in.\n\n\"So! This is good luck!\" Wutzler doffed his coolie hat, slid out of his\njacket, tossed both down among the oil-jars, and stooping over the dead\nman, began to untwist the scarlet turban. In the dim light his lean arms\nand frail body, coated with black hair, gave him the look of a puny ape\nrobbing a sleeper. He wriggled into the dead man's jacket, wound the\nblood-red cloth about his own temples, and caught up musket, ramrod,\npowder-horn, and bag of bullets.--\"Now I am all safe,\" he chuckled. \"Now\nI can go anywhere, to-night.\"\n\nHe shouldered arms and stood grinning as though all their troubles were\nended.\n\n\"So! I am rebel soldier. We try again; come.--Not too close behind me;\nand if I speak, run back.\"\n\nIn this order they began once more to scout through the smoke. No one\nmet them, though distant shapes rushed athwart the gloom, yelping to\neach other, and near by, legs of runners moved under a rolling cloud of\nsmoke as if their bodies were embedded and swept along in the\nwrack:--all confused, hurried, and meaningless, like the uproar of\ngongs, horns, conches, whistling bullets, crackers, and squibs that\nsputtering, string upon string, flower upon rising flower of misty red\ngold explosion, ripped all other noise to tatters.\n\nWhere and how he followed, Rudolph never could have told; but once, as\nthey ran slinking through the heaviest smoke and, as it seemed, the\nheart of the turmoil, he recognized the yawning rim of a clay-pit, not a\nstone's throw from his own gate. It was amazing to feel that safety lay\nso close; still more amazing to catch a glimpse of many coolies digging\nin the pit by torchlight, peacefully, as though they had heard of no\ndisturbance that evening. Hardly had the picture flashed past, than he\nwondered whether he had seen or imagined it, whose men they were, and\nwhy, even at any time, they should swarm so busy, thick as ants, merely\nto dig clay.\n\nHe had worry enough, however, to keep in view the white cross-barred\nhieroglyphic on his guide's jacket. Suddenly it vanished, and next\ninstant the muzzle of the gun jolted against his ribs.\n\n\"Run, quick,\" panted Wutzler, pushing him aside. \"To the left, into the\ngo-down. Here they are!--To your left!\" And with the words, he bounded\noff to the right, firing his gun to confuse the chase.\n\nRudolph obeyed, and, running at top speed, dimly understood that he had\ndoubled round a squad of grunting runners, whose bare feet pattered\nclose by him in the smoke. Before him gaped a black square, through\nwhich he darted, to pitch head first over some fat, padded bulk. As he\nrose, the rasping of rough jute against his cheek told him that he had\nfallen among bales; and a familiar, musty smell, that the bales were his\nown, in his own go-down, across a narrow lane from the nunnery. With\nhigh hopes, he stumbled farther into the darkness. Once, among the\nbales, he trod on a man's hand, which was silently pulled away. With no\ntime to think of that, he crawled and climbed over the disordered heaps,\ngroping toward the other door. He had nearly reached it, when torchlight\nflared behind him, rushing in, and savage cries, both shrill and\nguttural, rang through the stuffy warehouse. He had barely time, in the\nreeling shadows, to fall on the earthen floor, and crawl under a thin\ncurtain of reeds to a new refuge.\n\nInto this--a cubby-hole where the compradore kept his tally-slips,\numbrella, odds and ends--the torchlight shone faintly through the reeds.\nLying flat behind a roll of matting, Rudolph could see, as through the\ngauze twilight of a stage scene, the tossing lights and the skipping men\nwho shouted back and forth, jabbing their spears or pikes down among the\nbales, to probe the darkness. Their search was wild but thorough. Before\nit, in swift retreat, some one crawled past the compradore's room,\nbrushing the splint partition like a snake. This, as Rudolph guessed,\nmight be the man whose hand he had stepped on.\n\nThe stitches in the curtain became beads of light. A shadowy arm heaved\nup, fell with a dry, ripping sound and a vertical flash. A sword had cut\nthe reeds from top to bottom.\n\nThrough the rent a smoking flame plunged after the sword, and after\nboth, a bony yellow face that gleamed with sweat. Rudolph, half wrapped\nin his matting, could see the hard, glassy eyes shine cruelly in their\nnarrow slits; but before they lowered to meet his own, a jubilant yell\nresounded in the go-down, and with a grunt, the yellow face, the\nflambeau, and the sword were snatched away.\n\nHe lay safe, but at the price of another man's peril. They had caught\nthe crawling fugitive, and now came dragging him back to the lights.\nThrough the tattered curtain Rudolph saw him flung on the ground like an\nempty sack, while his captors crowded about in a broken ring, cackling,\nand prodding him with their pikes. Some jeered, some snarled, others\ncalled him by name, with laughing epithets that rang more friendly, or\nat least more jocular; but all bent toward him eagerly, and flung down\nquestion after question, like a little band of kobolds holding an\ninquisition. At some sharper cry than the rest, the fellow rose to his\nknees and faced them boldly. A haggard Christian, he was being fairly\ngiven his last chance to recant.\n\n\"Open your mouth! Open your mouth!\" they cried, in rage or entreaty.\n\nThe kneeling captive shook his head, and made some reply, very distinct\nand simple.\n\n\"Open your mouth!\" They struck at him with the torches. The same sword\nthat had slashed the curtain now pricked his naked chest. Rudolph,\nclenching his fists in a helpless longing to rush out and scatter all\nthese men-at-arms, had a strange sense of being transported into the\npast, to watch with ghostly impotence a mediaeval tragedy.\n\nThe kneeling man repeated his unknown declaration. His round, honest,\noily face was anything but heroic, and wore no legendary, transfiguring\nlight. He seemed rather stupid than calm; yet as he mechanically wound\nhis queue into place once more above the shaven forehead, his fingers\nmoved surely and deftly. Not once did they slip or tremble.\n\n\"Open your mouth!\" snarled the pikemen and the torch-bearers, with the\nfierce gestures of men who have wasted time and patience.\n\n\"The Lamp of Heaven!\" bawled the swordsman, beside himself. \"Give him\nthe Lamp of Heaven!\"\n\nTo the others, this phrase acted as a spark to powder.\n\n\"Good! good!\" they shrilled, nodding furiously. \"The Lamp of Heaven!\"\nAnd several men began to rummage and overhaul the chaos of the go-down.\nRudolph had given orders, that afternoon, to remove all necessary stores\nto the nunnery. But from somewhere in the darkness, one rioter brought a\nsack of flour, while another flung down a tin case of petroleum. The\nsword had no sooner cut the sack across and punctured the tin, than a\nfat villain in a loin cloth, squatting on the earthen floor, kneaded\nflour and oil into a grimy batch of dough.\n\n\"Will you speak out and live,\" cried the swordsman, \"or will you die?\"\n\nFor a second the Christian did not stir. Then, as though the option were\nnot in his power,--\n\n\"Die,\" he answered.\n\nThe fat baker sprang up, and clapped on the obstinate head a shapeless\ngray turban of dough. Half a dozen torches jostled for the honor of\nlighting it. The Christian, crowned with sooty flames, gave a single\ncry, clear above all the others. He was calling--as even Rudolph\nknew--on the strange god across the sea, Saviour of the Children of the\nWest, not to forget his nameless and lonely servant.\n\nRudolph groaned aloud, rose, and had parted the curtain to run out and\nfall upon them all, when suddenly, close at hand and sharp in the\ngeneral din, there burst a quick volley of rifleshots. Splinters flew\nfrom the attap walls. A torch-bearer and the man with the sword spun\nhalf round, collided, and fell, the one across the other, like drunken\nwrestlers. The survivors flung down their torches and ran, leaping and\ndiving over bales. On the ground, the smouldering Lamp of Heaven showed\nthat its wearer, rescued by a lucky bullet, lay still in a posture of\nhumility. Strange humility, it seemed, for one so suddenly given the\ncomplete and profound wisdom that confirms all faith, foreign or\ndomestic, new or old.\n\nWith a sense of all this, but no clear sense of action, Rudolph found\nthe side-door, opened it, closed it, and started across the lane. He\nknew only that he should reach the mafoo's little gate by the pony-shed,\nand step out of these dark ages into the friendly present; so that when\nsomething from the wall blazed point-blank, and he fell flat on the\nground, he lay in utter defeat, bitterly surprised and offended. His own\nfriends: they might miss him once, but not twice. Let it come quickly.\n\nInstead, from the darkness above came the most welcome sound he had ever\nknown,--a keen, high voice, scolding.\n\n\"What the devil are you firing at?\" It was Heywood, somewhere on the\nroof of the pony-shed. He put the question sharply, yet sounded cool and\ncheerful. \"A shadow? Rot! You waste another cartridge so, and I'll take\nyour gun away. Remember that!\"\n\nNesbit's voice clipped out some pert objection.\n\n\"Potted the beggar, any'ow--see for yourself--go-down 's afire.\"\n\n\"Saves us the trouble of burning it.\" The other voice moved away, with\na parting rebuke. \"No more of that, sniping and squandering. Wait till\nthey rush you.\"\n\nRudolph lifted his head from the dust.\n\n\"Maurice!\" he called feebly. \"Maurice, let me in!\"\n\n\"Hallo!\" answered his captain on the wall, blithely. \"Steady on, we'll\nget you.\"\n\nOf all hardships, this brief delay was least bearable. Then a bight of\nrope fell across Rudolph's back. He seized it, hauled taut, and planting\nhis feet against the wall, went up like a fish, to land gasping on a row\nof sand-bags.\n\n\"Ho, you wandering German!\" His invisible friend clapped him on the\nshoulder. \"By Jove, I'm glad. No time to burble now, though. Off with\nyou. Compradore has a gun for you, in the court. Collect a drink as you\ngo by. Report to Kneebone at the northeast corner. Danger point there:\nwe need a good man, so hurry. Devilish glad. Cut along.\"\n\nRudolph, scrambling down from the pony-shed, ran across the compound\nwith his head in a whirl. Yet through all the scudding darkness and\nconfusion, one fact had pierced as bright as a star. On this night of\nalarms, he had turned the great corner in his life. Like the pale\nstranger with his crown of fire, he could finish the course.\n\nHe caught his rifle from the compradore's hand, but needed no draught\nfrom any earthly cup. Brushing through the orange trees, he made for the\nnortheast angle, free of all longing perplexities, purged of all vile\nadmiration, and fit to join his friends in clean and wholesome danger.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nSIEGE\n\nHe never believed that they could hold the northeast corner for a\nminute, so loud and unceasing was the uproar. Bullets spattered sharply\nalong the wall and sang overhead, mixed now and then with an\nindescribable whistling and jingling. The angle was like the prow of a\nship cutting forward into a gale. Yet Rudolph climbed, rejoicing, up the\nshort bamboo ladder, to the platform which his coolies had built in such\nhaste, so long ago, that afternoon.\n\nHis high spirits went before a fall. As he stood up, in the full glow\nfrom the burning go-down, somebody tackled him about the knees and threw\nhim head first on the sand-bags.\n\n\"How many times must I give me orders?\" barked the little sea-captain.\n\"Under cover, under cover, and stay under cover, or I'll send ye below,\nye gallivanting--Oh! it's you, is it? Well, there's your port-hole.\" A\nstubby finger pointed in the obscurity. \"There! and don't ye fire till\nI say so!\"\n\nThus made welcome, Rudolph crawled toward a chink among the bags, ran\nthe muzzle of his gun into place, and lay ready for whatever might come\nout of the quaking lights and darknesses beyond.\n\nNothing came, however, except a swollen continuity of sound, a rolling\ncloud of noises, thick and sullen as the smell of burnt gunpowder. It\nwas strange, thought Rudolph, how nothing happened from moment to\nmoment. No yellow bodies came charging out of the hubbub. He himself lay\nthere unhurt; his fellows joked, grumbled, shifted their legs on the\nplatform. At times the heavier, duller sound, which had been the signal\nfor the whole disorder,--one ponderous beat, as on a huge and very slack\nbass-drum,--told that the Black Dog from Rotterdam was not far off. Yet\neven then there followed no shock of round-shot battering at masonry,\nbut only an access of the stormy whistling and jingling.\n\n\"Copper cash,\" declared the voice of Heywood, in a lull. By the sound,\nhe was standing on the rungs of the ladder, with his head at the level\nof the platform; also by the sound, he was enjoying himself\ninordinately. \"What a jolly good piece of luck! Scrap metal and copper\ncash. Firing money at us--like you, Captain. Just what we thought, too.\nSome unruly gang among them wouldn't wait, and forced matters. Tonight\nwas premature. The beggars have plenty of powder, and little else.\nSo far.\"\n\nRudolph listened in wonder. Here, in the thick of the fight, was a\nlight-hearted, busy commander, drawing conclusions and extracting news\nfrom chaos.\n\n\"Look out for arrows,\" continued the speaker, as he crawled to a\nloophole between Rudolph's and the captain's. \"They're shooting arrows\nup over. Killed one convert and wounded two, there by the water gate.\nThey can't get the elevation for you chaps here, though.\" And again he\nadded, cheerfully, \"So far, at least.\"\n\nThe little band behind the loopholes lay watching through the smoke,\nlistening through the noise. The Black Dog barked again, and sent a\nshower of money clinking along the wall.\n\n\"How do you like it, Rudie?\" chuckled his friend.\n\n\"It is terrible,\" answered Rudolph, honestly.\n\n\"Terrible racket, yes. Fireworks, to frighten us. Wait till their\nammunition comes; then you'll see fun. Fireworks, all this.\" Heywood\nturned to his other companion. \"I say, Kneebone, what's your idea?\nSniping all night, will it be?--or shall we get a fair chance at 'em?\"\n\nThe captain, a small, white, recumbent spectre, lifted his head and\nappeared to sniff the smoke judicially.\n\n\"They get a chance at us, more like!\" he grumbled. \"My opinion, the\nblighters have shot and burnt themselves into a state o' mind; bloomin'\ndelusion o' grandeur, that's what. Wildest of 'em will rush us to-night,\nonce--maybe twice. We stave 'em off, say: that case, they'll settle down\nto starve us, right and proper.\"\n\n\"Siege,\" assented Heywood.\n\n\"Siege, like you read about.\" The captain lay flat again. \"Wish a man\ncould smoke up here.\"\n\nHeywood laughed, and turned his head:--\n\n\"How much do you know about sieges, old chap?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Rudolph confessed.\n\n\"Nor I, worse luck. Outside of school--_testudine facia,_ that sort of\nthing. However,\" he went on cheerfully, \"we shall before long\"--He broke\noff with a start. \"Rudie! By Jove, I forgot! Did you find them? Where's\nBertha Forrester?\"\n\n\"Gone,\" said Rudolph, and struggling to explain, found his late\nadventure shrunk into the compass of a few words, far too small and bare\nto suggest the magnitude of his decision. \"They went,\" he began, \"in\na boat--\"\n\nHe was saved the trouble; for suddenly Captain Kneebone cried in a voice\nof keen satisfaction, \"Here they come! I told ye!\"--and fired his rifle.\n\nThrough a patch of firelight, down the gentle <DW72> of the field, swept\na ragged cohort of men, some bare-headed, some in their scarlet\nnightcaps, as though they had escaped from bed, and all yelling. One of\nthe foremost, who met the captain's bullet, was carried stumbling his\nown length before he sank underfoot; as the Mausers flashed from between\nthe sand-bags, another and another man fell to his knees or toppled\nsidelong, tripping his fellows into a little knot or windrow of kicking\narms and legs; but the main wave poured on, all the faster. Among and\nabove them, like wreckage in that surf, tossed the shapes of\nscaling-ladders and notched bamboos. Two naked men, swinging between\nthem a long cylinder or log, flashed through the bonfire space and on\ninto the dark below the wall.\n\n\"Pung-dongs!\" bawled the captain. \"Look out for the pung-dong!\"\n\nHis friends were too busy firing into the crowded gloom below. Rudolph,\nfumbling at side-bolt and pulling trigger, felt the end of a ladder bump\nhis forehead, saw turban and mediaeval halberd heave above him, and\nwithout time to think of firing, dashed the muzzle of his gun at the\nclimber's face. The shock was solid, the halberd rang on the platform,\nbut the man vanished like a shade.\n\n\"Very neat,\" growled Heywood, who in the same instant, with a great\nshove, managed to fling down the ladder. \"Perfectly silly attack. We'll\nhold 'em.\"\n\nWhile he spoke, however, something hurtled over their heads and thumped\nthe platform. The queer log, or cylinder, lay there with a red coal\nsputtering at one end, a burning fuse. Heywood snatched at it and\nmissed. Some one else caught up the long bulk, and springing to his\nfeet, swung it aloft. Firelight showed the bristling moustache of\nKempner, his long, thin arms poising a great bamboo case bound with\nrings of leather or metal. He threw it out with his utmost force,\nstaggered as though to follow it; then, leaping back, straightened his\ntall body with a jerk, flung out one arm in a gesture of surprise, no\nsooner rigid than drooping; and even while he seemed inflated for\nanother of his speeches, turned half-round and dove into the garden and\nthe night. By the ending of it, he had redeemed a somewhat rancid life.\n\nBefore, the angle was alive with swarming heads. As he fell, it was\nempty, and the assault finished; for below, the bamboo tube burst with a\nsound that shook the wall; liquid flame, the Greek fire of stink-pot\nchemicals, squirted in jets that revealed a crowd torn asunder, saffron\nfaces contorted in shouting, and men who leapt away with clothes afire\nand powder-horns bursting at their sides. Dim figures scampered off, up\nthe rising ground.\n\n\"That's over,\" panted Heywood. \"Thundering good lesson,--Here, count\nnoses. Rudie? Right-oh. Sturgeon, Teppich, Padre, Captain? Good! but\nlook sharp, while I go inspect.\" He whispered to Rudolph. \"Come down,\nwon't you, and help me with--you know.\"\n\nAt the foot of the ladder, they met a man in white, with a white face in\nwhat might be the dawn, or the pallor of the late-risen moon.\n\n\"Is Hackh there?\" He hailed them in a dry voice, and cleared his throat,\n\"Where is she? Where's my wife?\"\n\nIt was here, accordingly, while Heywood stooped over a tumbled object on\nthe ground, that Rudolph told her husband what Bertha Forrester had\nchosen. The words came harder than before, but at last he got rid of\nthem. His questioner stood very still. It was like telling the news of\nan absent ghost to another present.\n\n\"This town was never a place,\" said Gilly, with all his former\nsteadiness,--\"never a place to bring a woman. And--and of her age.\"\n\nAll three men listened to the conflict of gongs and crackers, and to the\nshouting, now muffled and distant behind the knoll. All three, as it\nseemed to Rudolph, had consented to ignore something vile.\n\n\"That's all I wanted to know,\" said the older man, slowly. \"I must get\nback to my post. You didn't say, but--She made no attempt to come here?\nWell, that's--that's lucky. I'll go back.\"\n\nFor some time again they stood as though listening, till Heywood\nspoke:--\n\n\"Holding your own, are you, by the water gate?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied Forrester, rousing slightly. \"All quiet there. No\nmore arrows. Converts behaving splendidly. Two or three have begged\nfor guns.\"\n\n\"Give 'em this.\" Heywood skipped up the ladder, to return with a rifle.\n\"And this belt--Kempner's. Poor chap, he'll never ask you to return\nthem.--Anything else?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Gilly, taking the dead man's weapon, and moving off into\nthe darkness. \"No, except \"--He halted. \"Except if we come to a pinch,\nand need a man for some tight place, then give me first chance. Won't\nyou? I could do better, now, than--than you younger men. Oh, and Hackh;\nyour efforts to-night--Well, few men would have dared, and I feel\nimmensely grateful.\"\n\nHe disappeared among the orange trees, leaving Rudolph to think about\nsuch gratitude.\n\n\"Now, then,\" called Heywood, and stooped to the white bundle at their\nfeet. \"Don't stand looking. Can't be helped. Trust old Gilly to take it\nlike a man. Come bear a hand.\"\n\nAnd between them the two friends carried to the nunnery a tiresome\ntheorist, who had acted once, and now, himself tired and limp, would\noffend no more by speaking.\n\nWhen the dawn filled the compound with a deep blue twilight, and this in\nturn grew pale, the night-long menace of noise gradually faded also,\nlike an orgy of evil spirits dispersing before cockcrow. To ears long\ndeafened, the wide stillness had the effect of another sound, never\nheard before. Even when disturbed by the flutter of birds darting from\ntop to dense green top of the orange trees, the air seemed hushed by\nsome unholy constraint. Through the cool morning vapors, hot smoke from\nsmouldering wreckage mounted thin and straight, toward where the pale\ndisk of the moon dissolved in light. The convex field stood bare, except\nfor a few overthrown scarecrows in naked yellow or dusty blue, and for a\njagged strip of earthwork torn from the crest, over which the Black Dog\nthrust his round muzzle. In a truce of empty silence, the defenders\nslept by turns among the sand-bags.\n\nThe day came, and dragged by without incident. The sun blazed in the\ncompound, swinging overhead, and slanting down through the afternoon. At\nthe water gate, Rudolph, Heywood, and the padre, with a few forlorn\nChristians,--driven in like sheep, at the last moment,--were building\na rough screen against the arrows that had flown in darkness, and that\nnow lay scattered along the path. One of these a workman suddenly caught\nat, and with a grunt, held up before the padre.\n\nThe head was blunt. About the shaft, wound tightly with silk thread, ran\na thin roll of Chinese paper.\n\nDr. Earle nodded, took the arrow, and slitting with a pocket-knife,\nfreed and flattened out a painted scroll of complex characters. His keen\nold eyes ran down the columns. His face, always cloudy now, grew darker\nwith perplexity.\n\n\"A message,\" he declared slowly. \"I think a serious message.\" He sat\ndown on a pile of sacks, and spread the paper on his knee. \"But the\ncharacters are so elaborate--I can't make head or tail.\"\n\nHe beckoned Heywood, and together they scowled at the intricate and\nmeaningless symbols.\n\n\"All alike,\" complained the younger man. \"Maddening.\" Then his face\nlighted. \"No, see here--lower left hand.\"\n\nThe last stroke of the brush, down in the corner, formed a loose \"O. W.\"\n\n\"From Wutzler. Must mean something.\"\n\nFor all that, the painted lines remained a stubborn puzzle.\n\n\"Something, yes. But what?\" The padre pulled out a cigar, and smoking\nat top speed, spaced off each character with his thumb. \"They are all\nalike, and yet\"--He clutched his white hair with big knuckles, and\ntugged; replaced his mushroom helmet; held the paper at a new focus.\n\"Ah!\" he said doubtfully; and at last, \"Yes.\" For some time he read to\nhimself, nodding. \"A Triad cipher.\"\n\n\"Well?\" resumed Heywood, patiently.\n\nThe reader pointed with his cigar.\n\n\"Take only the left half of that word, and what have you?\"\n\n\"'Lightning,'\" read Heywood.\n\n\"The right half?\"\n\n\"'Boat.'\"\n\n\"Take,\" the padre ordered, \"this one; left half?\"\n\n\"'Lightning,'\" repeated his pupil. \"The right half--might be\n'rice-scoop,' But that's nonsense.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the padre. \"You have the secret. It's good Triad writing.\nSubtract this twisted character 'Lightning' from each, and we've made\nthe crooked straight. The writer was afraid of being caught. Here's the\nsense of his message, I take it.\" And he read off, slowly:--\n\n\"A Hakka boat on opposite shore; a green flag and a rice-scoop hoisted\nat her mast; light a fire on the water-gate steps, and she will come\nquickly, day or night.--O.W.\"\n\nHeywood took the news coldly. He shook his head, and stood thinking.\n\n\"That won't help,\" he said curtly. \"Never in the world.\"\n\nWith the aid of a convert, he unbarred the ponderous gate, and ventured\nout on the highest slab of the landing-steps. Across the river, to be\nsure, there lay--between a local junk and a stray _papico_ from the\nnorth--the high-nosed Hakka boat, her deck roofed with tawny\nbasket-work, and at her masthead a wooden rice-measure dangling below a\ngreen rag. Aft, by the great steering-paddle, perched a man, motionless,\nyet seeming to watch. Heywood turned, however, and pointed downstream to\nwhere, at the bend of the river, a little spit of mud ran out from the\nmarsh. On the spit, from among tussocks, a man in a round hat sprang up\nlike a thin black toadstool. He waved an arm, and gave a shrill cry,\nsummoning help from further inland. Other hats presently came bobbing\ntoward him, low down among the marsh. Puffs of white spurted out from\nthe mud. And as Heywood dodged back through the gate, and Nesbit's rifle\nanswered from his little fort on the pony-shed, the distant crack of the\nmuskets joined with a spattering of ooze and a chipping of stone on the\nriver-stairs.\n\n\"Covered, you see,\" said Heywood, replacing the bar. \"Last resort,\nperhaps, that way. Still, we may as well keep a bundle of firewood\nready here.\"\n\nThe shots from the marsh, though trivial and scattering, were like a\nsignal; for all about the nunnery, from a ring of hiding-places, the\nnoise of last night broke out afresh. The sun lowered through a brown,\nburnt haze, the night sped up from the ocean, covering the sky with\nsudden darkness, in which stars appeared, many and cool, above the\ntorrid earth and the insensate turmoil. So, without change but from\npause to outbreak, outbreak to pause, nights and days went by in\nthe siege.\n\nNothing happened. One morning, indeed, the fragments of another blunt\narrow came to light, broken underfoot and trampled into the dust. The\npaper scroll, in tatters, held only a few marks legible through dirt and\nheel-prints: \"Listen--work fast--many bags--watch closely.\" And still\nnothing happened to explain the warning.\n\nThat night Heywood even made a sortie, and stealing from the main gate\nwith four coolies, removed to the river certain relics that lay close\nunder the wall, and would soon become intolerable. He had returned\nsafely, with an ancient musket, a bag of bullets, a petroleum squirt,\nand a small bundle of pole-axes, and was making his tour of the\ndefenses, when he stumbled over Rudolph, who knelt on the ground under\nwhat in old days had been the chapel, and near what now was\nKempner's grave.\n\nHe was not kneeling in devotion, for he took Heywood by the arm, and\nmade him stoop.\n\n\"I was coming,\" he said, \"to find you. The first night, I saw coolies\nworking in the clay-pit. Bend, a moment over. Put now the ear close.\"\n\nHeywood laid his cheek in the dust.\n\n\"They're keeping such a racket outside,\" he muttered; and then, half to\nhimself: \"It certainly is. Rudie, it's--it's as if poor Kempner\nwere--waking up.\" He listened again. \"You're right. They are digging.\"\n\nThe two friends sat up, and eyed each other in the starlight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nBROTHER MOLES\n\nThis new danger, working below in the solid earth, had thrown Rudolph\ninto a state of sullen resignation. What was the use now, he thought\nindignantly, of all their watching and fighting? The ground, at any\nmoment, might heave, break, and spring up underfoot. He waited for his\nfriend to speak out, and put the same thought roundly into words.\nInstead, to his surprise, he heard something quite contrary.\n\n\"Now we know!\" said Heywood, in lively satisfaction. \"Now we know what\nthe beasts have up their sleeve. That's a comfort. Rather!\"\n\nHe sat thinking, a white figure in the starlight, cross-legged like a\nBuddha.\n\n\"That's why they've all been lying doggo,\" he continued. \"And then their\nbad marksmanship, with all this sniping--they don't care, you see,\nwhether they pot us or not. They'd rather make one clean sweep, and\n'blow us at the moon.' Eh? Cheer up, Rudie: so long as they're digging,\nthey're not blowing. Are they?\"\n\nWhile he spoke, the din outside the walls wavered and sank, at last\ngiving place to a shrill, tiny interlude of insect voices. In this\ndiluted silence came now and then a tinkle of glass from the dark\nhospital room where Miss Drake was groping among her vials.\nHeywood listened.\n\n\"If it weren't for that,\" he said quietly, \"I shouldn't much care.\nExcept for the women, this would really be great larks.\" Then, as a\nshadow flitted past the orange grove, he roused himself to hail: \"Ah\nPat! Go catchee four piecee coolie-man!\"\n\n\"Can do.\" The shadow passed, and after a time returned with four other\nshadows. They stood waiting, till Heywood raised his head from the dust.\n\n\"Those noises have stopped, down there,\" he said to Rudolph; and rising,\ngave his orders briefly. The coolies were to dig, strike into the\nsappers' tunnel, and report at once: \"Chop-chop.--Meantime, Rudie, let's\ntake a holiday. We can smoke in the courtyard.\"\n\nA solitary candle burned in the far corner of the inclosure, and cast\nfaint streamers of reflection along the wet flags, which, sluiced with\nwater from the well, exhaled a slight but grateful coolness. Heywood\nstooped above the quivering flame, lighted a cigar, and sinking loosely\ninto a chair, blew the smoke upward in slow content.\n\n\"Luxury!\" he yawned. \"Nothing to do, nothing to fret about, till the\ncompradore reports. Wonderful--too good to be true.\"\n\nFor a long time, lying side by side, they might have been asleep.\nThrough the dim light on the white walls dipped and swerved the drunken\nshadow of a bat, who now whirled as a flake of blackness across the\nstars, now swooped and set the humbler flame reeling. The flutter of his\nleathern wings, and the plash of water in the dark, where a coolie still\ndrenched the flags, marked the sleepy, soothing measures in a nocturne,\nbroken at strangely regular intervals by a shot, and the crack of a\nbullet somewhere above in the deserted chambers.\n\n\"Queer,\" mused Heywood, drowsily studying his watch. \"The beggar puts\none shot every five minutes through the same window.--I wonder what he's\nthinking about? Lying out there, firing at the Red-Bristled Ghosts. Odd!\nWonder what they're all\"--He put back his cigar, mumbling. \"Handful of\npoor blackguards, all upset in their minds, and sweating round. And all\nthe rest tranquil as ever, eh?--the whole country jogging on the same\nold way, or asleep and dreaming dreams, perhaps, same kind of dreams\nthey had in Marco Polo's day.\"\n\nThe end of his cigar burned red again; and again, except for that, he\nmight have been asleep. Rudolph made no answer, but lay thinking. This\nbrief moment of rest in the cool, dim courtyard--merely to lie there\nand wait--seemed precious above all other gain or knowledge. Some quiet\ninfluence, a subtle and profound conviction, slowly was at work in him.\nIt was patience, wonder, steady confidence,--all three, and more. He had\nfelt it but this once, obscurely; might die without knowing it in\nclearer fashion; and yet could never lose it, or forget, or come to any\nlater harm. With it the stars, above the dim vagaries of the bat, were\nbrightly interwoven. For the present he had only to lie ready, and wait,\na single comrade in a happy army.\n\nThrough a dark little door came Miss Drake, all in white, and moving\nquietly, like a symbolic figure of evening, or the genius of the place.\nHer hair shone duskily as she bent beside the candle, and with steady\nfingers tilted a vial, from which amber drops fell slowly into a glass.\nWith dark eyes watching closely, she had the air of a young, beneficent\nMedea, intent on some white magic.\n\n\"Aren't you coming,\" called Heywood, \"to sit with us awhile?\"\n\n\"Can't, thanks,\" she replied, without looking up. \"I'm too busy.\"\n\n\"That's no excuse. Rest a little.\"\n\nShe moved away, carrying her medicines, but paused in the door, smiled\nback at him as from a crypt, and said:--\n\n\"Have _you_ been hurt?\"\n\n\"Only my feelings.\"\n\n\"I've no time,\" she laughed, \"for lazy able-bodied persons.\" And she was\ngone in the darkness, to sit by her wounded men.\n\nWith her went the interval of peace; for past the well-curb came another\nfigure, scuffing slowly toward the light. The compradore, his robes lost\nin their background, appeared as an oily face and a hand beckoning with\ndownward sweep. The two friends rose, and followed him down the\ncourtyard. In passing out, they discovered the padre's wife lying\nexhausted in a low chair, of which she filled half the length and all\nthe width. Heywood paused beside her with some friendly question, to\nwhich Rudolph caught the answer.\n\n\"Oh, quite composed.\" Her voice sounded fretful, her fan stirred weakly.\n\"Yes, wonderfully composed. I feel quite ready to suffer for the faith.\"\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Earle,\" said the young man, gently, \"there ought to be no\nneed. Nobody shall suffer, if we can prevent. I think we can.\"\n\nUnder the orange trees, he laid an unsteady hand on Rudolph's arm, and\nhalting, shook with quiet merriment.\n\n\"Poor dear lady!\" he whispered, and went forward chuckling.\n\nLoose earth underfoot warned them not to stumble over the new-raised\nmound beside the pit, which yawned slightly blacker than the night.\nKempner's grave had not been quieter. The compradore stood whispering:\nthey had found the tunnel empty, because, he thought, the sappers were\ngone out to eat their chow.\n\n\"We'll see, anyway,\" said Heywood, stripping off his coat. He climbed\nover the mound, grasped the edges, and promptly disappeared. In the long\nmoment which followed, the earth might have closed on him. Once, as\nRudolph bent listening over the shaft, there seemed to come a faint\nmomentary gleam; but no sound, and no further sign, until the head and\nshoulders burrowed up again.\n\n\"Big enough hole down there,\" he reported, swinging clear, and sitting\nwith his feet in the shaft. \"Regular cave. Three sacks of powder stowed\nalready, so we're none too soon.--One sack was leaky. I struck a match,\nand nearly blew myself to Casabianca.\" He paused, as if reflecting. \"It\ngives us a plan, though. Rudie: are you game for something rather\nfoolhardy? Be frank, now; for if you wouldn't really enjoy it, I'll give\nold Gilly Forrester his chance.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Rudolph, stung as by some perfidy. \"You make me--ashamed!\nThis is all ours, this part, so!\"\n\n\"Can do,\" laughed the other. \"Get off your jacket. Give me half a\nmoment start, so that you won't jump on my head.\" And he went wriggling\ndown into the pit.\n\nAn unwholesome smell of wet earth, a damp, subterranean coolness,\nenveloped Rudolph as he slid down a flue of greasy clay, and stooping,\ncrawled into the horizontal bore of the tunnel. Large enough, perhaps,\nfor two or three men to pass on all fours, it ran level, roughly cut,\nthrough earth wet with seepage from the river, but packed into a smooth\nfloor by many hands and bare knees. It widened suddenly before him. In\nthe small chamber of the mine, choked with the smell of stale betel, he\nbumped Heywood's elbow.\n\n\"Some Fragrant Ones have been working here, I should say.\" The speaker\npatted the ground with quick palms, groping. \"Phew! They've worked like\nsteam. This explains old Wutz, and his broken arrow. I say, Rudie, feel\nabout. I saw a coil of fuse lying somewhere.--At least, I thought it\nwas. Ah, never mind: have-got!\" He pulled something along the floor.\n\"How's the old forearm I gave you? I forgot that. Equal to hauling a\nsack out? Good! Catch hold, here.\"\n\nSweeping his hand in the darkness, he captured Rudolph's, and guided it\nto where a powder-bag lay.\n\n\"Now, then, carry on,\" he commanded; and crawling into the tunnel,\nflung back fragments of explanation as he tugged at his own load. \"Carry\nthese out--far as we dare--touch 'em off, you see, and block the\npassage. Far out as possible, though. We can use this hole afterward,\nfor listening in, if they try--\"\n\nHe cut the sentence short. Their tunnel had begun to <DW72> gently\ndownward, with niches gouged here and there for the passing of\nburden-bearers. Rudolph, toiling after, suddenly found his head\nentangled between his leader's boots.\n\n\"Quiet,\" he heard him whisper. \"Somebody coming.\"\n\nAn instant later, the boots withdrew quickly. An odd little squeak of\nsurprise followed, a strange gurgling, and a succession of rapid shocks,\nas though some one were pummeling the earthen walls.\n\n\"Got the beggar,\" panted Heywood. \"Only one of 'em. Roll clear, Rudie,\nand let us pass. Collar his legs, if you can, and shove.\"\n\nSqueezing past Rudolph in his niche, there struggled a convulsive bulk,\nlike some monstrous worm, too large for the bore, yet writhing. Bare\nfeet kicked him in violent rebellion, and a muscular knee jarred\nsquarely under his chin. He caught a pair of naked legs, and hugged\nthem dearly.\n\n\"Not too hard,\" called Heywood, with a breathless laugh. \"Poor\ndevil--must think he ran foul of a genie.\"\n\nIndeed, their prisoner had already given up the conflict, and lay under\nthem with limbs dissolved and quaking.\n\n\"Pass him along,\" chuckled his captor. \"Make him go ahead of us.\"\n\nProdded into action, the man stirred limply, and crawled past them\ntoward the mine, while Heywood, at his heels, growled orders in the\nvernacular with a voice of dismal ferocity. In this order they gained\nthe shaft, and wriggled up like ferrets into the night air. Rudolph,\nstanding as in a well, heard a volley of questions and a few timid\nanswers, before the returning legs of his comrade warned him to dodge\nback into the tunnel.\n\nAgain the two men crept forward on their expedition; and this time the\nleader talked without lowering his voice.\n\n\"That chap,\" he declared, \"was fairly chattering with fright. Coolie, it\nseems, who came back to find his betel-box. The rest are all outside\neating their rice. We have a clear track.\"\n\nThey stumbled on their powder-sacks, caught hold, and dragged them, at\nfirst easily down the incline, then over a short level, then arduously\nup a rising grade, till the work grew heavy and hot, and breath came\nhard in the stifled burrow.\n\n\"Far enough,\" said Heywood, puffing. \"Pile yours here.\"\n\nRudolph, however, was not only drenched with sweat, but fired by a new\nspirit, a spirit of daring. He would try, down here in the bowels of the\nearth, to emulate his friend.\n\n\"But let us reconnoitre,\" he objected. \"It will bring us to the clay-pit\nwhere I saw them digging. Let us go out to the end, and look.\"\n\n\"Well said, old mole!\" Heywood snapped his fingers with delight. \"I\nnever thought of that.\" By his tone, he was proud of the amendment.\n\"Come on, by all means. I say, I didn't really--I didn't _want_ poor old\nGilly down here, you know.\"\n\nThey crawled on, with more speed but no less caution, up the strait\nlittle gallery, which now rose between smooth, soft walls of clay.\nSuddenly, as the incline once more became a level, they saw a glimmering\nsquare of dusky red, like the fluttering of a weak flame through scarlet\ncloth. This, while they shuffled toward it, grew higher and broader,\nuntil they lay prone in the very door of the hill,--a large, square-cut\nportal, deeply overhung by the edge of the clay-pit, and flanked with\nwhat seemed a bulkhead of sand-bags piled in orderly tiers. Between\nshadowy mounds of loose earth flickered the light of a fire, small and\ndistant, round which wavered the inky silhouettes of men, and beyond\nwhich dimly shone a yellow face or two, a yellow fist clutched full of\nboiled rice like a snowball. Beyond these, in turn, gleamed other little\nfires, where other coolies were squatting at their supper.\n\n\"Rudie, look!\" Heywood's voice trembled with joyful excitement. \"Look,\nthese bags; not sand-bags at all! It's powder, old chap, powder! Their\nwhole supply. Wait a bit--oh, by Jove, wait a bit!\"\n\nHe scurried back into the hill like a great rat, returned as quickly and\nswiftly, and with eager hands began to uncoil something on the clay\nthreshold.\n\n\"Do you know enough to time a fuse?\" he whispered. \"Neither do I.\nPowder's bad, anyhow. We must guess at it. Here, quick, lend me a\nknife.\" He slashed open one of the lower sacks in the bulkhead by the\ndoor, stuffed in some kind of twisted cord, and, edging away, sat for an\ninstant with his knife-blade gleaming in the ruddy twilight. \"How long,\nRudie, how long?\" He smothered a groan. \"Too long, or too short, spoils\neverything. Oh, well--here goes.\"\n\nThe blade moved.\n\n\"Now lie across,\" he ordered, \"and shield the tandstickor.\" With a\nsudden fuff, the match blazed up to show his gray eyes bright and\ndancing, his face glossy with sweat; below, on the golden clay, the\ntwisted, lumpy tail of the fuse, like the end of a dusty vine. Darkness\nfollowed, quick and blinding. A rosy, fitful coal sputtered, darting out\nshort capillary lines and needles of fire.\n\n\"Cut sticks--go like the devil! If it blows up, and caves the earth on\nus--\" Heywood ran on hands and knees, as if that were his natural way of\ngoing. Rudolph scrambled after, now urged by an ecstasy of apprehension,\nnow clogged as by the weight of all the hill above them. If it should\nfall now, he thought, or now; and thus measuring as he crawled, found\nthe tunnel endless.\n\nWhen at last, however, they gained the bottom of the shaft, and were\nhoisted out among their coolies on the shelving mound, the evening\nstillness lay above and about them, undisturbed. The fuse could never\nhave lasted all these minutes. Their whole enterprise was but labor\nlost. They listened, breathing short. No sound came.\n\n\"Gone out,\" said Heywood, gloomily. \"Or else they saw it.\"\n\nHe climbed the bamboo scaffold, and stood looking over the wall. Rudolph\nperched beside him,--by the same anxious, futile instinct of curiosity,\nfor they could see nothing but the night and the burning stars.\n\n\"Gone out. Underground again, Rudie, and try our first plan.\" Heywood\nturned to leap down. \"The Sword-Pen looks to set off his mine\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\nHe clutched the wall in time to save himself, as the bamboo frame leapt\nunderfoot. Outside, the crest of the <DW72> ran black against a single\nburst of flame. The detonation came like the blow of a mallet on\nthe ribs.\n\n\"Let him look! Let him look!\" Heywood jumped to the ground, and in a\npelting shower of clods, exulted:--\n\n\n\"He looked again, and saw it was\nThe middle of next week!\"\n\n\n\"Come on, brother mole. Spread the news!\"\n\nHe ran off, laughing, in the wide hush of astonishment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nTHE HAKKA BOAT\n\n\"Pretty fair,\" Captain Kneebone said. \"But that ain't the end.\"\n\nThis grudging praise--in which, moreover, Heywood tamely acquiesced--was\nhis only comment. On Rudolph it had singular effects: at first filling\nhim with resentment, and almost making him suspect the little captain of\njealousy; then amusing him, as chance words of no weight; but in the\nunreal days that followed, recurring to convince him with all the force\nof prompt and subtle fore-knowledge. It helped him to learn the cold,\nsalutary lesson, that one exploit does not make a victory.\n\nThe springing of their countermine, he found, was no deliverance. It had\ntwo plain results, and no more: the crest of the high field, without,\nhad changed its contour next morning as though a monster had bitten it;\nand when the day had burnt itself out in sullen darkness, there burst on\nall sides an attack of prolonged and furious exasperation. The fusillade\nnow came not only from the landward sides, but from a long flotilla of\nboats in the river; and although these vanished at dawn, the fire never\nslackened, either from above the field, or from a distant wall, newly\nspotted with loopholes, beyond the ashes of the go-down. On the night\nfollowing, the boats crept closer, and suddenly both gates resounded\nwith the blows of battering-rams. These and later assaults were beaten\noff. By daylight, the nunnery walls were pitted as with small-pox; yet\nthe little company remained untouched, except for Teppich, whose shaven\nhead was trimmed still closer and redder by a bullet, and for Gilbert\nForrester, who showed--with the grave smile of a man when fates are\nplayful--two shots through his loose jacket.\n\nHe was the only man to smile; for the others, parched by days and\nsweltered by nights of battle, questioned each other with hollow eyes\nand sleepy voices. One at a time, in patches of hot shade, they lay\ntumbled for a moment of oblivion, their backs studded thickly with\nobstinate flies like the driven heads of nails. As thickly, in the dust,\nempty Mauser cartridges lay glistening.\n\n\"And I bought food,\" mourned the captain, chafing the untidy stubble on\nhis cheeks, and staring gloomily down at the worthless brass. \"I bought\nchow, when all Saigong was full o' cartridges!\"\n\nThe sight of the spent ammunition at their feet gave them more trouble\nthan the swarming flies, or the heat, or the noises tearing and\nsplitting the heat. Even Heywood went about with a hang-dog air,\nspeaking few words, and those more and more surly. Once he laughed, when\nat broad noonday a line of queer heads popped up from the earthwork on\nthe knoll, and stuck there, tilted at odd angles, as though peering\nquizzically. Both his laugh, however, and his one stare of scrutiny were\nfilled with a savage contempt,--contempt not only for the stratagem, but\nfor himself, the situation, all things.\n\n\"Dummies--lay figures, to draw our fire. What a childish trick! Maskee!\"\nhe added, wearily \"we couldn't waste a shot at 'em now even if they\nwere real.\"\n\nHis grimy hearers nodded mechanically. They knew, without being told,\nthat they should fire no more until at close quarters in some\nfinal rush.\n\n\"Only a few more rounds apiece,\" he continued. \"Our friends outside must\nhave run nearly as short, according to the coolie we took prisoner in\nthe tunnel. But they'll get more supplies, he says, in a day or two.\nWhat's worse, his Generalissimo Fang expects big reinforcement, any day,\nfrom up country. He told me that a moment ago.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's lying,\" said Captain Kneebone, drowsily.\n\n\"Wish he were,\" snapped Heywood. \"No such luck. Too stupid.\"\n\n\"That case,\" grumbled the captain, \"we'd better signal your Hakka boat,\nand clear out.\"\n\nAgain their hollow eyes questioned each other in discouragement. It was\nplain that he had spoken their general thought; but they were all too\nhot and sleepy to debate even a point of safety. Thus, in stupor or\ndoubt, they watched another afternoon burn low by invisible degrees,\nlike a great fire dying. Another breathless evening settled over all--at\nfirst with a dusty, copper light, widespread, as though sky and land\nwere seen through smoked glass; another dusk, of deep, sad blue; and\nwhen this had given place to night, another mysterious lull.\n\nMidnight drew on, and no further change had come. Prowlers, made bold by\nthe long silence in the nunnery, came and went under the very walls of\nthe compound. In the court, beside a candle, Ah Pat the compradore sat\nwith a bundle of halberds and a whetstone, sharpening edge after edge,\nplacidly, against the time when there should be no more cartridges.\nHeywood and Rudolph stood near the water gate, and argued with Gilbert\nForrester, who would not quit his post for either of them.\n\n\"But I'm not sleepy,\" he repeated, with perverse, irritating serenity.\n\"I'm not, I assure you. And that river full of their boats?--Go away.\"\n\nWhile they reasoned and wrangled, something scraped the edge of the\nwall. They could barely detect a small, stealthy movement above them, as\nif a man, climbing, had lifted his head over the top. Suddenly, beside\nit, flared a surprising torch, rags burning greasily at the end of a\nlong bamboo. The smoky, dripping flame showed no man there, but only\nanother long bamboo, impaling what might be another ball of rags. The\ntwo poles swayed, inclined toward each other; for one incredible instant\nthe ball, beside its glowing fellow, shone pale and took on human\nfeatures. Black shadows filled the eye-sockets, and gave to the face an\nuncertain, cavernous look, as though it saw and pondered.\n\nHow long the apparition stayed, the three men could not tell; for even\nafter it vanished, and the torch fell hissing in the river, they stood\nbelow the wall, dumb and sick, knowing only that they had seen the head\nof Wutzler.\n\nHeywood was the first to make a sound--a broken, hypnotic sound, without\nemphasis or inflection, as though his lips were frozen, or the words\ntorn from him by ventriloquy.\n\n\"We must get the women--out of here.\"\n\nAfterward, when he was no longer with them, his two friends recalled\nthat he never spoke again that night, but came and went in a kind of\nsilent rage, ordering coolies by dumb-show, and carrying armful after\narmful of supplies to the water gate. He would neither pause nor answer.\n\nThe word passed, or a listless, tacit understanding, that every one must\nhold himself ready to go aboard so soon after daylight as the hostile\nboats should leave the river. \"If,\" said Gilly to Rudolph, while they\nstood thinking under the stars, \"if his boat is still there, now that\nhe--after what we saw.\"\n\nAt dawn they could see the ragged flotilla of sampans stealing up-river\non the early flood; but of the masts that huddled in vapors by the\nfarther bank, they had no certainty until sunrise, when the green rag\nand the rice-measure appeared still dangling above the Hakka boat.\n\nEven then it was not certain--as Captain Kneebone sourly pointed\nout--that her sailors would keep their agreement. And when he had piled,\non the river-steps, the dry wood for their signal fire, a new difficulty\nrose. One of the wounded converts was up, and hobbling with a stick; but\nthe other would never be ferried down any stream known to man. He lay\ndying, and the padre could not leave him.\n\nAll the others waited, ready and anxious; but no one grumbled because\ndeath, never punctual, now kept them waiting. The flutter of birds,\namong the orange trees, gradually ceased; the sun came slanting over\nthe eastern wall; the gray floor of the compound turned white and\nblurred through the dancing heat. A torrid westerly breeze came\nfitfully, rose, died away, rose again, and made Captain Kneebone curse.\n\n\"A fair wind lost,\" he muttered. \"Next we'll lose the ebb, too, be\n'anged.\"\n\nNoon passed, and mid-afternoon, before the padre came out from the\ncourtyard, covering his white head with his ungainly helmet.\n\n\"We may go now,\" he said gravely, \"in a few minutes.\"\n\nNo more were needed, for the loose clods in the old shaft of their\ncounter-mine were quickly handled, and the necessary words soon uttered.\nCaptain Kneebone had slipped out through the water gate, beforehand, and\nlighted the fire on the steps. But not one of the burial party turned\nhis head, to watch the success or failure of their signal, so long as\nthe padre's resonant bass continued.\n\nWhen it ceased, however, they returned quickly through the little grove.\nThe captain opened the great gate, and looked out eagerly, craning to\nsee through the smoke that poured into his face.\n\n\"The wasters!\" he cried bitterly. \"She's gone.\"\n\nThe Hakka boat had, indeed, vanished from her moorings. On the bronze\ncurrent, nothing moved but three fishing-boats drifting down, with the\nsmoke, toward the marsh and the bend of the river, and a small junk that\ntoiled up against wind and tide, a cluster of naked sailors tugging and\nshoving at her heavy sweep, which chafed its rigging of dry rope, and\ngave out a high, complaining note like the cry of a sea-gull.\n\n\"She's gone,\" repeated Captain Kneebone. \"No boat for us.\"\n\nBut the compradore, dragging his bundle of sharp halberds, poked an\ninquisitive head out past the captain's, and peered on all sides through\nthe smoke, with comical thoroughness. He dodged back, grinning and\nducking amiably.\n\n\"Moh bettah look-see,\" he chuckled; \"dat coolie come-back, he too muchee\nwaitee, b'long one piecee foolo-man.\"\n\nHe was wrong. Whoever handled the Hakka boat was no fool, but by working\nupstream on the opposite shore, crossing above, and dropping down with\nthe ebb, had craftily brought her along the shallow, so close beneath\nthe river-wall, that not till now did even the little captain spy her.\nThe high prow, the mast, now bare, and her round midships roof, bright\ngolden-thatched with leaves of the edible bamboo, came moving quiet as\nsome enchanted boat in a calm. The fugitives by the gate still thought\nthemselves abandoned, when her beak, six feet in air, stole past them,\nand her lean boatmen, prodding the river-bed with their poles, stopped\nher as easily as a gondola. The yellow steersman grinned, straining at\nthe pivot of his gigantic paddle.\n\n\"Good boy, lowdah!\" called Kneebone. \"Remember _you_ in my will, too!\"\nAnd the grinning lowdah nodded, as though he understood.\n\nThey had now only to pitch their supplies through the smoke, down on the\nloose boards of her deck. Then--Rudolph and the captain kicking the\nbonfire off the stairs--the whole company hurried down and safely over\nher gunwale: first the two women, then the few huddling converts, the\nwhite men next, the compradore still hugging his pole-axes, and last of\nall, Heywood, still in strange apathy, with haggard face and downcast\neyes. He stumbled aboard as though drunk, his rifle askew under one arm,\nand in the crook of the other, Flounce, the fox-terrier, dangling,\nnervous and wide awake.\n\nHe looked to neither right nor left, met nobody's eye. The rest of the\ncompany crowded into the house amidships, and flung themselves down\nwearily in the grateful dusk, where vivid paintings and mysteries of\nrude carving writhed on the fir bulkheads. But Heywood, with his dog and\nthe captain and Rudolph, sat in the hot sun, staring down at the\nramshackle deck, through the gaps in which rose all the stinks of the\nsweating hold.\n\nThe boatmen climbed the high slant of the bow, planted their stout\nbamboos against their shoulders, and came slowly down, head first, like\nstraining acrobats. As slowly, the boat began to glide past the stairs.\n\nThus far, though the fire lay scattered in the mud, the smoke drifted\nstill before them and obscured their silent, headlong transaction. Now,\nthinning as they dropped below the corner of the wall, it left them\nnaked to their enemies on the knoll. At the same instant, from the marsh\nahead, the sentinel in the round hat sprang up again, like an\ninstantaneous mushroom. He shouted, and waved to his fellows inland.\n\nThey had no time, however, to leave the high ground; for the whole\nchance of the adventure took a sudden and amazing turn.\n\nHeywood sprang out of his stupor, and stood pointing.\n\n\"Look there!\" he snarled. \"Those--oh!\"\n\nHe ended with a groan. The face of his friend, by torchlight above the\nwall, had struck him dumb. Now that he spoke, his companions saw,\nexposed in the field to the view of the nunnery, a white body lying on a\nframework as on a bier. Near the foot stood a rough sort of windlass.\nAbove, on the crest of the field, where a band of men had begun to\nscramble at the sentinel's halloo, there sat on a white pony the\nbright-robed figure of the tall fanatic, Fang the Sword-Pen.\n\n\"He did it!\" Heywood's hands opened and shut rapidly, like things out of\ncontrol. \"Oh, Wutz, how did they--Saint Somebody--the martyrdom--\nPoussin's picture in the Vatican.--I can't stand this, you chaps!\"\n\nHe snatched blindly at his gun, caught instead one of the compradore's\nhalberds, and without pause or warning, jumped out into the shallow\nwater. He ran splashing toward the bank, turned, and seemed to waver,\nstaring with wild eyes at the strange Tudor weapon in his hand. Then\nshaking it savagely,--\n\n\"This will do!\" he cried. \"Good-by, everybody. Good-by!\"\n\nHe wheeled again, staggered to his feet on dry ground, and ran swiftly\nalong the eastern wall, up the rising field, straight toward his mark.\n\nOf the men on the knoll, a few fired and missed, the others, neutrals to\ntheir will, stood fixed in wonder. Four or five, as the runner neared,\nsprang out to intercept, but flew apart like ninepins. The watchers in\nthe boat saw the halberd flash high in the late afternoon sun, the\nfrightened pony swerve, and his rider go down with the one sweep of that\nHomeric blow.\n\nThe last they saw of Heywood, he went leaping from sight over the\ncrest, that swarmed with figures racing and stumbling after.\n\nThe unheeded sentinel in the marsh fled, losing his great hat, as the\nboat drifted round the point into midstream.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nTHE DRAGON'S SHADOW\n\nThe lowdah would have set his dirty sails without delay, for the fair\nwind was already drooping; but at the first motion he found himself\ndeposed, and a usurper in command, at the big steering-paddle. Captain\nKneebone, his cheeks white and suddenly old beneath the untidy stubble\nof his beard, had taken charge. In momentary danger of being cut off\ndownstream, or overtaken from above, he kept the boat waiting along the\noozy shore. Puckering his eyes, he watched now the land, and now the\nriver, silent, furtive, and keenly perplexed, his head on a swivel, as\nthough he steered by some nightmare chart, or expected some instant and\ntransforming sight.\n\nNot until the sun touched the western hills, and long shadows from the\nbank stole out and turned the stream from bright copper to vague\niron-gray, did he give over his watch. He left the tiller, with a\nhopeless fling of the arm.\n\n\"Do as ye please,\" he growled, and cast himself down on deck by the\nthatched house. \"Go on.--I'll never see _him_ again.--The heat, and\nall--By the head, he was--Go on. That's all. Finish.\"\n\nHe sat looking straight before him, with dull eyes that never moved;\nnor did he stir at the dry rustle and scrape of the matting sail, slowly\nhoisted above him. The quaggy banks, now darkening, slid more rapidly\nastern; while the steersman and his mates in the high bow invoked the\nwind with alternate chant, plaintive, mysterious, and half musical:--\n\n\n\"Ay-ly-chy-ly\nAh-ha-aah!\"\n\n\nTo the listeners, huddled in silence, the familiar cry became a long,\nmonotonous accompaniment to sad thoughts. Through the rhythm, presently,\nbroke a sound of small-arms,--a few shots, quick but softened by\ndistance, from far inland. The stillness of evening followed.\n\nThe captain stirred, listened, dropped his head, and sat like stone. To\nRudolph, near him, the brief disturbance called up another evening--his\nfirst on this same river, when from the grassy brink, above, he had\nfirst heard of his friend. Now, at the same place, and by the same\nlight, they had heard the last. It was intolerable: he turned his back\non the captain. Inside, in the gloom of the painted cabin, the padre's\nwife began suddenly to cry. After a time, the deep voice of her husband,\nspeaking very low, and to her alone, became dimly audible:--\n\n\"'All this is come upon us; yet have we not--Our heart is not turned\nback, neither have our steps declined--Though thou hast sore broken us\nin the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.'\"\n\nThe little captain groaned, and rolled aside from the doorway.\n\n\"All very fine,\" he muttered, his head wrapped in his arms. \"But that's\nno good to me. I can't stand it.\"\n\nWhether she heard him, or by chance, Miss Drake came quietly from\nwithin, and found a place between him and the gunwale. He did not rouse;\nshe neither glanced nor spoke, but leaned against the ribs of\nsmooth-worn fir, as though calmly waiting.\n\nWhen at last he looked up, to see her face and posture, he gave an angry\nstart.\n\n\"And I thought,\" he blurted, \"be 'anged if sometimes I didn't think you\nliked him!\"\n\nHer dark eyes met the captain's with a great and steadfast clearness.\n\n\"No,\" she whispered; \"it was more than that.\"\n\nThe captain sat bolt upright, but no longer in condemnation. For a long\ntime he watched her, marveling; and when finally he spoke, his sharp,\ndomineering voice was lowered, almost gentle.\n\n\"Always talked too much,\" he said. \"Don't mind me, my dear. I never\nmeant--Don't ye mind a rough old beggar, that don't know that hasn't one\nthing more between him and the grave. Not a thing--but money. And that,\nnow--I wish't was at the bottom o' this bloomin' river!\"\n\nThey said no more, but rested side by side, like old friends joined\ncloser by new grief. Flounce, the terrier, snuffing disconsolately about\nthe deck, and scratching the boards in her zeal to explore the shallow\nhold, at last grew weary, and came to snuggle down between the two\nsilent companions. Not till then did the girl turn aside her face, as\nthough studying the shore, which now melted in a soft, half-liquid band\nas black as coal-tar, above the luminous indigo of the river.\n\nSuddenly Rudolph got upon his feet, and craning outboard from gunwale\nand thatched eaves, looked steadily forward into the dusk. A chatter of\nangry voices came stealing up, in the pauses of the wind. He watched and\nlistened, then quickly drew in his head.\n\n\"Sit quiet,\" he said. \"A boat full of men. I do not like their looks.\"\n\nTwo or three of the voices hailed together, raucously. The steersman,\nleaning on the loom of his paddle, made neither stir nor answer. They\nhailed again, this time close aboard, and as it seemed, in rage.\nGlancing contemptuously to starboard, the lowdah made some negligent\nreply, about a cargo of human hair. His indifference appeared so real,\nthat for a moment Rudolph suspected him: perhaps he had been bought\nover, and this meeting arranged. The thought, however, was unjust. The\nvoices began to drop astern, and to come in louder confusion with\nthe breeze.\n\nBut at this point Flounce, the terrier, spoiled all by whipping up\nbeside the lowdah, and furiously barking. Hers was no pariah's yelp: she\nbarked with spirit, in the King's English.\n\nFor answer, there came a shout, a sharp report, and a bullet that ripped\nthrough the matting sail. The steersman ducked, but clung bravely to his\npaddle. Men tumbled out from the cabin, rifles in hand, to join Rudolph\nand the captain.\n\nAstern, dangerously near, they saw the hostile craft, small, but listed\nheavily with crowding ruffians, packed so close that their great wicker\nhats hung along the gunwale to save room, and shone dim in the obscurity\nlike golden shields of vikings. A squat, burly fellow, shouting, jammed\nthe yulow hard to bring her about.\n\n\"Save your fire,\" called Captain Kneebone. \"No shots to waste. Sit\ntight.\"\n\nAs he spoke, however, an active form bounced up beside the squat man at\nthe sweep,--a plump, muscular little barefoot woman in blue. She tore\nthe fellow's hands away, and took command, keeping the boat's nose\npointed up-river, and squalling ferocious orders to all on board.\n\n\"The Pretty Lily!\" cried Rudolph. This small, nimble, capable creature\ncould be no one but Mrs. Wu, their friend and gossip of that morning,\nlong ago....\n\nThe squat man gave an angry shout, and turned on her to wrest away the\nhandle. He failed, at once and for all. With great violence, yet with a\nneat economy of motion, the Pretty Lily took one hand from her tiller,\nlong enough to topple him overboard with a sounding splash.\n\nHer passengers, at so prompt and visual a joke, burst into shrill,\ncackling laughter. Yet more shrill, before their mood could alter, the\nPretty Lily scourged them with the tongue of a humorous woman. She held\nher course, moreover; the two boats drifted so quickly apart that when\nshe turned, to fling a comic farewell after the white men, they could no\nmore than descry her face, alert and comely, and the whiteness of her\nteeth. Her laughing cry still rang, the overthrown leader still\nfloundered in the water, when the picture blurred and vanished. Down the\nwind came her words, high, voluble, quelling all further mutiny aboard\nthat craft of hers.\n\n\"We owe this to you.\" The tall padre eyed Rudolph with sudden interest,\nand laid his big hand on the young man's shoulder. \"Did you catch what\nshe said? You made a good friend there.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Rudolph, and shook his head, sadly. \"We owe that to--some\none else.\"\n\nLater, while they drifted down to meet the sea and the night, he told\nthe story, to which all listened with profound attention, wondering at\nthe turns of fortune, and at this last service, rendered by a friend\nthey should see no more.\n\nThey murmured awhile, by twos and threes huddled in corners; then lay\nsilent, exhausted in body and spirit. The river melted with the shore\ninto a common blackness, faintly hovered over by the hot, brown, sullen\nevening. Unchallenged, the Hakka boat flitted past the lights of a\nwar-junk, so close that the curved lantern-ribs flickered thin and sharp\nagainst a smoky gleam, and tawny faces wavered, thick of lip and stolid\nof eye, round the supper fire. A greasy, bitter smell of cooking floated\nafter. Then no change or break in the darkness, except a dim lantern or\ntwo creeping low in a sampan, with a fragment of talk from unseen\npassers; until, as the stars multiplied overhead, the night of the land\nrolled heavily astern and away from another, wider night, the stink of\nthe marshes failed, and by a blind sense of greater buoyancy and\nsea-room, the voyagers knew that they had gained the roadstead. Ahead,\nfar off and lustrous, a new field of stars hung scarce higher than\ntheir gunwale, above the rim of the world.\n\nThe lowdah showed no light; and presently none was needed, for--as the\nshallows gave place to deeps--the ocean boiled with the hoary,\ngreen-gold magic of phosphorus, that heaved alongside in soft explosions\nof witch-fire, and sent uncertain smoky tremors playing through the\ndarkness on deck. Rudolph, watching this tropic miracle, could make out\nthe white figure of the captain, asleep near by, under the faint\nsemicircle of the deck-house; and across from him, Miss Drake, still\nsitting upright, as though waiting, with Flounce at her side. Landward,\nagainst the last sage-green vapor of daylight, ran the dim range of the\nhills, in long undulations broken by sharper crests, like the finny back\nof leviathan basking.\n\nOver there, thought Rudolph, beyond that black shape as beyond its\nguarding dragon, lay the whole mysterious and peaceful empire, with\nuncounted lives going on, ending, beginning, as though he, and his sore\nloss, and his heart vacant of all but grief, belonged to some\nunheard-of, alien process, to Nature's most unworthy trifling. This\nboatload of men and women--so huge a part of his own experience--was\nlike the tiniest barnacle chafed from the side of that dark,\nserene monster.\n\nRudolph stared long at the hills, and as they faded, hung his head.\nFrom that dragon he had learned much; yet now all learning was but loss.\n\nOf a sudden the girl spoke, in a clear yet guarded voice, too low to\nreach the sleepers.\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\" she said. \"Come tell me. It will be good for\nboth of us.\"\n\nRudolph crossed silently, and stood leaning on the gunwale beside her.\n\n\"I thought only,\" he answered, \"how much the hills looked so--as a\ndragon.\"\n\n\"How strange.\" The trembling phosphorus half-revealed her face, pale and\nstill. \"I was thinking of that, in a way. It reminded me of what he\nsaid, once--when we were walking together.\"\n\nTo their great relief, they found themselves talking of Heywood, sadly,\nbut freely, and as it were in a sudden calm. Their friendship seemed,\nfor the moment, a thing as long established as the dragon hills. Years\nafterward, Rudolph recalled her words, plainer than the fiery wonder\nthat spread and burst round their little vessel, or the long play of\nheat-lightning which now, from time to time, wavered instantly along the\neastern sea-line.\n\n\"You are right,\" she declared once. \"To go on with life, even when we\nare alone--You will go on, I know. Bravely.\" And again she said: \"Yes,\nsuch men as he are--a sort of Happy Warrior.\" And later, in her slow and\nlevel voice: \"You learned something, you say. Isn't that--what I\ncall--being invulnerable? When a man's greater than anything that\nhappens to him--\"\n\nSo they talked, their speech bare and simple, but the pauses and longer\nsilences filled with deep understanding, solemnized by the time and the\nplace, as though their two lonely spirits caught wisdom from the night,\nscope from the silent ocean, light from the flickering East.\n\nThe flashes, meanwhile, came faster and prolonged their glory, running\nbehind a thin, dead screen of scalloped clouds, piercing the tropic sky\nwith summer blue, and ripping out the lost horizon like a long black\nfibre from pulp. The two friends watched in silence, when Rudolph rose,\nand moved cautiously aft.\n\n\"Good-night,\" he whispered. \"You must sleep now.\"\n\nThat was not, however, the reason. So long as the boiling witch-fire\nturned their wake to golden vapor, he could not be sure; but whenever\nthe heat-lightning ran, and through the sere, phantasmal sail, the\nlookout in the bow flashed like a sharp silhouette through wire\ngauze,--then it seemed to Rudolph that another small black shape leapt\nout astern, and vanished. He stood by the lowdah, watching anxiously.\n\nTime and again the ocean flickered into view, like the floor of a\nmeasureless cavern; and still he could not tell. But at last the lowdah\nalso turned his head, and murmured. Their boat creaked monotonously,\ndrifting to leeward in a riot of golden mist; yet now another creaking\ndisturbed the night, in a different cadence. Another boat followed them,\nrowing fast and gaining. In a brighter flash, her black sail fluttered,\nunmistakable.\n\nRudolph reached for his gun, but waited silently. He would not call out.\nSome chance fisherman, it might be, or any small craft holding the same\ncourse along the coast. Still, he did not like the hurry of the sweeps,\nwhich presently groaned louder and threw up nebulous fire. The\nstranger's bow became an arrowhead of running gold.\n\nAnd here was Flounce, ready to misbehave once more. Before he could\ncatch her, the small white body of the terrier whipped by him, and past\nthe steersman. This time, however, as though cowed, she began to\nwhimper, and then maintained a long, trembling whine.\n\nBeside Rudolph, the compradore's head bobbed up.\n\n\"Allo same she mastah come.\" And in his native tongue, Ah Pat grumbled\nsomething about ghosts.\n\nA harsh voice hailed, from the boat astern; the lowdah answered; and so\nrapidly slid the deceptive glimmer of her bow, that before Rudolph knew\nwhether to wake his friends, or could recover, next, from the shock and\necstasy of unbelief, a tall white figure jumped or swarmed over\nthe side.\n\n\"By Jove, my dream!\" sounded the voice of Heywood, gravely. With fingers\nthat dripped gold, he tried to pat the bounding terrier. She flew up at\nhim, and tumbled back, in the liveliest danger of falling overboard.\n\"Old girl,--my dream!\"\n\nThe figure rose.\n\n\"Hallo, Rudie.\" In a daze, Rudolph gripped the wet and shining hands,\nand heard the same quiet voice: \"Rest all asleep, I suppose? Don't wake\n'em. To-morrow will do.--Have you any money on you? Toss that\nfisherman--whatever you think I'm worth. He really rowed like steam,\nyou know.\"\n\nRudolph flung his purse into the other boat. When he turned, this man\nrestored from the sea had disappeared. But he had only stolen forward,\ndog in arms, to sit beside Miss Drake. So quietly had all happened, that\nnone of the sleepers, not even the captain, was aware. Rudolph drew near\nthe two murmuring voices.\n\n\"--Couldn't help it, honestly,\" said Heywood. \"Can't describe, or\nexplain. Just something--went black inside my head, you know.\" He\npaused. \"No: don't recall seeing a thing, really, until I pitched away\nthe--what happened to be in my hands. A blank, all that. Losing your\nhead, I suppose they call it. Most extraordinary.\"\n\nThe girl's question recalled him from his puzzle.\n\n\"Do? Oh!\" He disposed of the subject easily. \"I ran, that's all.--Oh,\nyes, but I ran faster.--Not half so many as you'd suppose. Most of 'em\nwere away, burning your hospital. Saw the smoke, as I ran. All gone but\na handful. Hence those stuffed hats, Rudie, in the trench.--Only three\nof the lot could run. I merely scuttled into the next bamboo, and kept\non scuttling. No: they weren't half loaded. Oh, yes, arrow in the\nshoulder--scratch. Of course, when it came dark, I stopped running, and\nmade for the nearest fisherman. That's all.\"\n\n\"But,\" protested Rudolph, wondering, \"we heard shots.\"\n\n\"Yes, I had my Webley in my belt. Fortunately. I _told_ you: three of\nthem could run.\" The speaker patted the terrier in his lap. \"My dream,\neh, little dog? You _were_ the only one to know.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the girl: \"I knew--all the time, that--\"\n\nWhatever she meant, Rudolph could only guess; but it was true, he\nthought, that she had never once spoken as though the present meeting\nwere not possible, here or somewhere. Recalling this, he suddenly but\nquietly stepped away aft, to sit beside the steersman, and smile in\nthe darkness.\n\nThe two voices flowed on. He did not listen, but watched the phosphorus\nwelling soft and turbulent in the wake, and far off, in glimpses of the\ntropic light, the great Dragon weltering on the face of the waters. The\nshape glimmered forth, died away, like a prodigy. How ran the verse?\n\n\n\"Ich lieg' und besitze.\nLass mich schlafen.\"\n\n\n\"And yet,\" thought the young man, \"I have one pearl from his hoard.\"\nThat girl was right: like Siegfried tempered in the grisly flood, the\nraw boy was turning into a man, seasoned and invulnerable.\n\nHeywood was calling to him:--\n\n\"You must go Home with us. Do you hear? I've made a wonderful plan--with\nthe captain's fortune! Dear old Kneebone.\"\n\nA small white heap across the deck began to rise.\n\n\"How often,\" complained a voice blurred with sleep, \"how often must I\ntell ye--wake me, unless the ship--chart's all--Good God!\"\n\nAt the captain's cry, those who lay in darkness under the thatched roof\nbegan to mutter, to rise, and grope out into the trembling light, with\nsleepy cries of joy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dragon's blood, by Henry Milner Rideout\n\n*** "}, {"short_book_title": "Travels in Morocco Volume 2 by James Richardson", "publication_date": 1860, "url": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10356", "text": "\n\n\n\nProduced by Carlo Traverso, Tom Allen and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team from images generously made available\nby the Bibliotheque nationale de France (BnF/Gallica) at\nhttp://gallica.bnf.fr.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTRAVELS IN MOROCCO,\n\nBY THE LATE JAMES RICHARDSON,\n\nAUTHOR OF \"A MISSION TO CENTRAL AFRICA,\"\n\"TRAVELS IN THE DESERT OF SAHARA,\" &C.\n\nEDITED BY HIS WIDOW.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIN TWO VOLUMES.\n\nVOL.

The European Jewesses settled in Mogador, are\nindeed the belles of society, and attend all the balls (such as they\nare). The Jewess sooner forgets religious differences than the Jew, and\nI was told by a Christian lady, it would be a dangerous matter for a\nChristian gentleman to make an offer of marriage to a Mogador Jewess,\nunless in downright earnest; as it would be sure to be accepted.\n\nMonsieur Delaport, Consul of France, was the first official person who\nbrought prominently forward the native and other Jews into the European\nsociety of this place, and since then, these Jews have improved in their\nmanners, and increased their respectability. The principal European Jews\nare from London, Gibraltar, and Marseilles. Many native Jews have\nattempted to wear European clothes; and a European hat, or coat, is now\nthe rage among native Jewesses, who all aspire to get a husband wearing\neither. Such are elements of the progress of the Jewess population in\nthis part of the world, and there is no doubt their position has been\ngreatly ameliorated within the last half century, or since the time of\nAli Bey, who thus describes their wretched condition in his days.\n\n\"Continual disputes arise between the Jew and the Moor; when the Jew is\nwrong, the Moor takes his own satisfaction, and if the Jew be right, he\nlodges a complaint with the judge, who always decides in favour of the\nMussulman. I have seen the Mahometan children amuse themselves by\nbeating little Jews, who durst not defend themselves. When a Jew passes\na mosque, he is obliged to take off his slippers, or shoes; he must do\nthe same when he passes the house of the Kaed, the Kady, or any\nMussulman of distinction. At Fez, and in some other towns, they are\nobliged to walk barefooted.\" Ali Bey mentions other vexations and\noppressions, and adds, \"When I saw the Jews were so ill-treated and\nvexed in every way, I asked them why they did not go to another country.\nThey answered that they could not do so, because they were slaves of the\nSultan.\" Again he says, \"As the Jews have a particular skill in\nthieving, they indemnify themselves for the ill-treatment they receive\nfrom the Moors, by cheating them daily.\"\n\nJewesses are exempt from taking off their slippers, or sandals, when\npassing the mosques. The late Emperor, Muley Suleiman, [1] professed to\nbe a rigidly exact Mussulman, and considered it very indecent, and a\ngreat scandal that Jewesses, some of them, like most women of this\ncountry, of enormous dimensions, should be allowed to disturb the decent\nframe of mind of pious Mussulmen, whilst entering the threshold of the\nhouse of prayer, by the sad exhibitions of these good ladies stooping\ndown and shewing their tremendous calves, when in the act of taking off\ntheir shoes before passing the mosques. For such reasons, Jewesses are\nnow privileged and exempted from the painful necessity of walking\nbarefoot in the streets.\n\nThe policy of the Court in relation to the Jews continually fluctuates.\nSometimes, the Emperor thinks they ought to be treated like the rest of\nhis subjects; at other times, he seems anxious to renew in all its\nvigour the system described by Ali Bey. Hearing that the Jews of\nTangier, on returning from Gibraltar, would often adopt the European\ndress, and so, by disguising themselves, be treated like Christians and\nEuropeans, he ordered all these would-be Europeans forthwith to be\nundressed, and to resume their black turban.\n\nAlas, how were all these Passover, Tabernacle and wedding festivals,\nthese happy and joyous days of the Jewish society of Mogador, changed on\nthe bombardment of that city! What became of the rich and powerful\nmerchants, the imperial vassals of commerce with their gorgeous wives\nbending under the weight of diamonds, pearls, and precious gems, during\nthat sad and unexpected period? The newspapers of the day recorded the\nmelancholy story. Many of the Jews were massacred, or buried underneath\nthe ruins of the city; their wives subjected to plunder; the rest were\nleft wandering naked and starving on the desolate sandy coast of the\nAtlantic, or hidden in the mountains, obtaining a momentary respite from\nthe rapacious fury of the savage Berbers and Arabs.\n\nIt is well known that, while the French bombarded Tangier and Mogador\nfrom without, the Berber and Arab tribes, aided by the _canaille_ of the\nMoors, plundered the city from within. Several of the Moorish rabble\ndeclared publicly, and with the greatest cowardice and villainous\neffrontery, \"When the French come to destroy Mogador, we shall go and\npillage the Jews' houses, strip the women of their ornaments, and then\nescape to the mountains from the pursuit of the Christians.\" These\nthreats they faithfully executed; but, by a just vengeance, they were\npillaged in turn, for the Berbers not only plundered the Jews\nthemselves, but the Moors who had escaped from the city laden with their\nbooty.\n\nIt is to be hoped that a better day is dawning for North African Jews.\nThe Governments of France and England can do much for them in Morocco.\n\nThe Jews of the Atlas formed the subject of some of Mr. Davidson's\nliterary labours; I have made further inquiries and shall give the\nreader some account of them, adding that portion of Mr. Davidson's\ninformation which was borne out by further investigation. The Atlas Jews\nare physically, if not morally, superior to their brethren who reside\namong the Moors. They are dispersed over the Atlas ranges, and have all\nthe characteristics of mountaineers. They enjoy, like their neighbours,\nthe Berbers and Shelouhs, a species of quasi-independence of the\nImperial authority, but they usually attach themselves to certain Berber\nchieftains who protect them, and whose standards they follow.\n\nThese are the only Jews in Mahometan countries of whom I have heard as\nbearing arms. They have, however, their own Sheiks, to whose\njurisdiction all domestic matters are referred. They wear the same\nattire as the mountaineers, and are not distinguishable from them, they\ndo not address the Moors by the term of respect and title \"Sidi,\" but in\nthe same way as the Moors and Arabs when they accost each other. They\nspeak the Shelouh language.\n\nMr. Davidson mentions some curious circumstances about these Jews, and\nof their having a city beyond the Atlas, where three or four thousand\nare living in perfect freedom, and cultivating the soil, which they have\npossessed since the time of Solomon. The probability is that Mr.\nDavidson's informant refers to the Jews of the Oasis of Sahara, where\nthere certainly are some families of Jews living in comparative freedom\nand independence.\n\nAs to the peculiarities of the religion of the Atlas Jews, they are said\nnot to have the Pentateuch and the law in the same order as Jews\ngenerally. They are unacquainted with Ezra, or Christ; they did not go\nto Babylon at the captivity, but were dispersed over Africa at that\nperiod. They are a species of Caraaites, or Jewish Protestants. Shadai\nis the name which they apply to the Supreme Being, when speaking of him.\nTheir written law begins by stating that the world was many thousand\nyears old when the present race of men was formed, which, curiously\nenough, agrees with the researches of modern geology. The present race\nof men are the joint offspring of different and distinct human species.\nThe deluge is not mentioned by them. God, it is said, appeared to\nIshmael in a dream, and told him he must separate from Isaac, and go to\nthe desert, where he would make him a great nation. There would ever\nafter be enmity between the two races, as at this day there is the\ngreatest animosity between the Jews and Mahometans.\n\nThe great nucleus of these Shelouh Jews is in _Jebel Melge_, or the vast\nridge of the Atlas capped with eternal snows; and they hold\ncommunications with the Jews of Ait Mousa, Frouga or Misfuva. They\nrarely descend to the plains or cities of the empire, and look upon the\nrest of the Jews of this country as heretics. Isolation thus begets\nenmity and mistrust, as in other cases. A few years ago, a number came\nto Mogador, and were not at all pleased with their visit, finding fault\nwith everything among their brethren. These Jewish mountaineers are\nsupposed to be very numerous. In their homes, they are inaccessible. So\nthey live in a wild independence, professing a creed as free as their\nown mountain airs. God, who made the hills, made likewise man's freedom\nto abide therein. Before taking leave of the Maroquine Israelites, I\nmust say something of their personal appearance. Both in Tangier and\nMogador, I was fortunate enough to be acquainted with families, who\ncould boast of the most perfect and classic types of Jewish female\nloveliness. Alas, that these beauties should be only charming _animals_,\ntheir minds and affections being left uncultivated, or converted into\ncaves of unclean and tormenting passions. The Jewesses, in general,\nuntil they become enormously stout and weighed down with obesity, are of\nextreme beauty. Most of them have fair complexions; their rose and\njasmine faces, their pure wax-like delicate features, and their\nexceedingly expressive and bewitching eyes, would fascinate the most\nfastidious of European connoisseurs of female beauty.\n\nBut these Israelitish ladies, recalling the fair image of Rachel in the\nPatriarchal times of Holy Writ, and worthy to serve as models for a\nGrecian sculptor, are treated with savage disdain by the churlish Moors,\nand sometimes are obliged to walk barefoot and prostrate themselves\nbefore their ugly negress concubines. The male infants of Jews are\nengaging and goodlooking when young; but, as they grow up, they become\nordinary; and Jews of a certain age, are decidedly and most disgustingly\nugly. It is possible that the degrading slavery in which they usually\nlive, their continued habits of cringing servility, by which the\ncountenance acquires a sinister air and fiendishly cunning smirk, may\ncause this change in their appearance. But what contrasts we had of the\nbeauty of countenance and form in the Jewish society of Mogador! You\nfrequently see a youthful woman, nay a girl of exquisite beauty and\ndelicacy of features, married to an old wretched ill-looking fellow of\nsome sixty or seventy years of age, tottering over the grave, or an\nincurable invalid. To render them worse-looking, whilst the women may\ndress in any and the gayest colours, the men wear a dark blue and black\nturban and dress, and though this is prescribed as a badge of\noppression, they will often assume it when they may attire themselves in\nwhite and other livelier colours. However, men get used to their misery,\nand hug their chains.\n\nThe Jews, at times, though but very rarely, avail themselves of their\nprivilege of four wives granted them in Mahometan countries, and a nice\nmess they make of it. I knew a Jew of this description in Tunis. He was\na lively, jocose fellow, with a libidinous countenance, singing always\nsome catch of a song. He was a silk-mercer, and pretty well off. His\nhouse was small, and besides a common _salle-a-manger_, divided into\nfour compartments for his four wives, each defending her room with the\nferocity of a tigress. Two of them were of his own age, about fifty, and\ntwo not more than twenty. The two elder ones, I was told by his\nneighbours, were entirely abandoned by the husband, and the two younger\nones were always bickering and quarrelling, as to which of them should\nhave the greater favour of their common tyrant; the house a scene of\ntumult, disorder and indecency. Amongst the whole of the wives, there\nwas only one child, a boy, of course an immense pet, a little surly\nwretch; his growth smothered, his health nearly ruined, by the\noverattentions of the four women, whom he kicked and pelted when out of\nhumour.\n\nThis little imp was the fit type, or interpretation of the presiding\ngenius of polygamy. I once visited this happy family, this biting satire\non domestic bliss and the beauty of the harem of the East. The women\nwere all sour, and busy at work, weaving or spinning cotton, \"Do you\nwork for your husband?\" I asked,\n\n_The women_.--\"Thank Rabbi, no.\"\n\n_Traveller_.--\"What do you do with your money?\"\n\n_The women_.--\"Spend it ourselves.\"\n\n_Traveller_.--\"How do you like to have only one husband among you four?\"\n\n_The women_.--\"Pooh! is it not the will of God?\"\n\n_Traveller_.--\"Whose boy is that?\"\n\n_The women_.--\"It belongs to us all.\"\n\n_Traveller_.--\"Have you no other children?\"\n\n_The women_.--\"Our husband is good for no more than that.\"\n\nWhilst I was talking to these angelic creatures, their beloved lord was\nquietly stuffing capons, without hearing our polite discourse. A\nEuropean Jew who knew the native society of Jews well, represents\ndomestic bliss to be a mere phantom, and scarcely ever thought of, or\nsought after. Poor human nature!\n\nI took a walk round the suburbs one morning, whilst a strong wind was\nbringing the locusts towards the coast, which fell upon us like\nhailstones. Young locusts frequently crowd upon the neighbouring hills\nin thousands and tens of thousands. They are little green things. No one\nknows whence they come and whither they go. These are not destructive.\nIndeed, unless swarms of locusts appear darkening the sky, and full\ngrown ones, they do not permanently damage the country. The wind usually\ndisperses them; they rarely take a long flight, except impelled by a\nviolent gale. Arabs attempt to destroy locusts by digging pits into\nwhich they may fall. This is merely playing with them. Jews fry them in\noil and salt, and sell them as we sell shrimps, the taste of which they\nresemble.\n\nOn my return, I passed a Mooress, or rather a Mauritanian Venus, who was\nso stout that she had fallen down, and could not get up. A mule was\nfetched to carry her home. But the Moor highly relishes these enormous\nlumps of fat, according to the standard beauty laid down by the\ntalebs--\"Four things in a woman should be ample, the lower part of the\nback, the thighs, the calves of the legs and the knees.\"\n\nSome time ago, there were discovered at Malta various rude statues of\nwomen very ample in the lower part of the \"back,\" supposed to be of\nLibyan origin, so that stout ladies have been the choicest of the\nfashion for ages past; the fattening of women, like so many capons and\nturkeys, begins when they are betrothed.\n\nThey then swallow three times a day regular boluses of paste, and are\nnot allowed to take exercise. By the time marriage takes place, they are\nin a tolerable good condition, not unlike Smithfield fattened heifers.\nThe lady of one of the European merchants being very thin, the Moors\nfrequently asked her husband how it was, and whether she had enough to\neat, hinting broadly that he starved her.\n\nOn the other hand, two or three of the merchant's wives were exceedingly\nstout, and of course great favourites with the men folks of this city.\n\nThe discrepancies of age, in married people, is most unnatural and\ndisgusting; whilst the merchants were at Morocco, a little girl of nine\nyears of age was married to a man upwards of fifty. Ten and eleven is a\ncommon age for girls to be married. Much has been said of the reverence\nof children for their parents in the East, and tribes of people\nmigrating therefrom, and the fifth commandment embodies the sentiment of\nthe Eastern world. But there is little of this in Mogador; a European\nJewess, who knows all the respectable Jewish and many of the Moorish\nfamilies, assured me that children make their aged parents work for\nthem, as long as the poor creatures can. \"Honour thy father and thy\nmother,\" is quite as much neglected here as in Europe. However, there is\nsome difference. The indigent Moors and Jews maintain their aged parents\nin their own homes, and we English Christian shut up ours in the Union\nBastiles.\n\nTo continue this domestic picture, the marriage settlements, especially\namong the Jews, are ticklish and brittle things, as to money or other\nmercenary arrangements.\n\nA match is often broken off, because a lamp of the value of four dollars\nhas been substituted for one of the value of twenty dollars, which was\nfirst promised on the happy day of betrothal.\n\nIndeed, nearly all marriages here are matters of sale and barter. Love\nis out of the question, he never flutters his purple wings over the\nbridal bed of Mogador. A Jewish or Moorish girl having placed before her\na rich, old ugly man, of mean and villanous character, of three score\nyears and upwards, and by his side, a handsome youth of blameless\ncharacter and amiable manners, will not hesitate a moment to prefer the\nformer. As affairs of intrigue and simple animal enjoyment are the great\nbusiness of life, the ways and means, in spite of Moorish and Mahometan\njealousy, as strong as death, by which these young and frail beauties\nindulge in forbidden conversations, are innumerable. Although the Moors\nfrequently relate romantic legends of lovely innocent brides, who had\nnever seen any other than the faces of their father, or of married\nladies, who never raised the veil from off their faces, except to\nreceive their own husbands, and seem to extol such chastity and\nseclusion; they are too frequently found indulging in obscene\nimaginations, tempting and seducing the weaker sex from the path of\nvirtue and honour. So that, if women are unchaste here, or elsewhere,\nmen are the more to blame: if woman goes one step wrong, men drag her\ntwo more. Men corrupt women, and then punish her for being corrupt,\ndepriving them of their natural and unalienable rights.\n\nSalt in Africa as in Europe is a domestic superstition. A Jewess, one\nmorning, in bidding adieu to her friends, put her fingers into a\nsalt-cellar, and took from it a large pinch of salt, which her friend\ntold me afterwards was to preserve her from the evil one. Salt is also\nused for a similar important purpose, when, during the night, a person\nis obliged to pass from one room into another in the dark. It would be\nan entertaining task to collect the manifold superstitions in different\nparts of the world, respecting this essential ingredient of human food.\n\nThe habit of drinking white brandy, stimulates the immorality of this\nMaroquine society. The Jews are the great factors of this _acqua\nardiente_, its Spanish and general name. Government frequently severely\npunishes them for making it; but they still persevere in producing this\nincentive to intoxication and crime. In all parts of the world, the most\ndegraded classes are the factors of the means of vice for the higher\norders of society. Moors drink it under protest, that it is not the\njuice of the grape. On the Sabbath, the Jewish families are all flushed,\nexcited, and tormented by this evil spirit; but when the highest\nenjoyments of intellect are denied to men, they must and will seek the\nlower and beastly gratifications.\n\nFriend Cohen came in one afternoon, and related several anecdotes of the\nMaroquine Court. When Dr. Brown was attending the Sultan, the Vizier\nmanaged to get hold of his cocked hat, and placing it upon his head,\nstrutted about in the royal gardens. Whilst performing this feat before\nseveral attendants, the Sultan suddenly made his appearance in the midst\nof them. The minister seeing him, fell down in a fright and a fit. His\nImperial Highness beckoned to the minister in such woful plight, to\npacify himself, and put his cloak before his mouth to prevent any one\nfrom seeing him laugh at the minister, which he did most immoderately.\n\nCohen, who is a quack, was once consulted on a case of the harem. Cohen\npleaded ignorance, God had not given him the wit; he could do nothing\nfor the patient of his Imperial Highness. This was very politic of\nCohen, for another quack, a Moor, had just been consulted, and had had\nhis head taken off, for not being successful in the remedies he\nprescribed. There would not be quite so much medicine administered among\nus, weak, cracky, crazy mortals, in this cold damp clime, if such an\nalternative was proposed to our practitioners.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nThe Maroquine dynasties.--Family of the Shereefian Monarchs.--Personal\nappearances and character of Muley Abd Errahman.--Refutation of the\ncharge of human sacrifices against the Moorish Princes.--Genealogy of\nthe reigning dynasty of Morocco.--The tyraufc Yezeed, (half\nIrish).--Muley Suleiman, the \"The Shereeff of Shereefs.\"--Diplomatic\nrelations of the Emperor of Morocco with European Powers.--Muley Ismael\nenamoured with the French Princess de Conti.--Rival diplomacy of France\nand England near the Maroquine Court.--Mr. Hay's correspondence with\nthis Court on the Slave-trade.--Treaties between Great Britain and\nMorocco; how defective and requiring amendment.--Unwritten engagements.\n\n\nMorocco, an immense and unwieldly remnant of the monarchies formed by\nthe Saracens, or first Arabian conquerors of Africa, has had a series of\ndynasties terminating in that of the Shereefs.\n\n1st. The Edristees (pure Saracens,) their capital was Fez, founded by\ntheir great progenitor, Edrio. The dynasty began in A.D. 789, and\ncontinued to 908.\n\n2nd. The Fatamites (also Saracens.) These conquered Egypt, and were the\nfaction of or lineal descendants of the daughter of the Prophet, the\nbeautiful pearl-like Fatima, succeeding to the above: this dynasty\ncontinued to 972.\n\n3rd. The Zuheirites (Zeirities, or Zereids) were usurpers of the former\nconquerors; their dynasty terminated in 1070.\n\n4th. Moravedi (or Marabouteen,) that is to say, Marabouts, [2] who rose\ninto consequence about 1050, and their first prince was Aberbekr Omer El\nLamethounx, a native of Sous. Their dynasty terminated in 1149.\n\n5th. The Almohades. These are supposed to be sprung from the Berber\ntribes. They conquered all North Western Morocco, and reigned about one\nhundred years, the dynasty terminated in 1269.\n\n6th. The Merinites. These in 1250 subjugated the kingdoms of Fez and\nMorocco; and in 1480 their dynasty terminated with the Shereef.\n\n7th. The Oatagi (or Ouatasi) [3] were a tribe of obscure origin. In\ntheir time, the Portuguese established themselves on the coast of\nMorocco; their dynasty ended in 1550.\n\n8th. The Shereefs (Oulad Ali) of the present dynasty, whose founder was\nHasein, have now occupied the Imperial throne more than three centuries.\nThis family of Shereefs came from the neighbourhood of Medina in Arabia,\nand succeeded to the empire of Morocco by a series of usurpations. They\nare divided into two branches, the Sherfah Hoseinee, so named from the\nfounder of the dynasty, who began to reign at Taroudant and Morocco in\n1524, and over all the empire in 1550, and the Sherfah El Fileli, or\nTafilett, whose ancestor was Muley Shereef Ben Ali-el-Hoseinee, and\nassumed sovereign power at Tafilett in 1648, from which country he\nextended his authority over all the provinces of that empire. Thus the\nShereefs began their reign in the middle of the seventeenth century, and\nhave now wielded the sword of the Prophet as Caliph of the West these\nlast two hundred years. I have not heard that there is anywhere a\ndynasty of Shereefs except in this country. They are, therefore,\nprofoundly venerated by all true Mussulmen. It was a great error to\nsuppose that Abd-el-Kader could have succeeded in dethroning the Emperor\nduring the hostilities of the Emir against the lineal representative of\nthe Prophet. Abd-el-Kader is a marabout warrior, greatly revered and\nidolized by all enthusiastic Mussulmen throughout North Africa, more\nespecially in Morocco, the _terre classique_ of holy-fighting men; but\nthough the Maroquines were disaffected, groaning under the avarice of\ntheir Shereefian Lord, and occasionally do revolt, nevertheless they\nwould not deliberately set aside the dynasty of the Shereefs, the\nveritable root and branch of the Prophet of God, for an adventurer of\nother blood, however powerful in arms and in sanctity.\n\nMorocco is the only independent Mussulman kingdom remaining, founded by\nthe Saracens when they conquered North Africa. Tunis and Tripoli are\nregencies of the Port of Tunis, having an hereditary Bey, while Tripoli\nis a simple Pasha, removable at pleasure. Algeria has now become an\nintegral portion of France by the Republic.\n\nMuley Abd Errahman was nominated to the throne by the solemn and dying\nrequest of his uncle, Muley Suleiman, to the detriment of his own\nchildren.\n\nHe belonged to one of the most illustrious branches of the reigning\ndynasty. In the natural order of succession, he ought to have taken\npossession of the Shereefian crown at the end of the last age; but,\nbeing a child, his uncle was preferred; for Mahometan sovereigns and\nempire are exposed to convulsions enough, without the additional dangers\nand elements of strife attendant on regencies.\n\nIn transmitting the sceptre to him, Muley Suleiman, therefore, only\nperformed an act of justice.\n\nMuley Abd Errahman, during his long reign, rendered the imperial\nauthority more solid than formerly, and established a species of\nconservative government in a semi-barbarous country, and exposed to\ncontinual commotions, like all Asiatic and African states. In governing\nthe multitudinous and heterogeneous tribes of his empire, his grand\nmaxim has ever been, like Austria, with her various states and hostile\ninterests of different people, \"Divide et empera.\" When will sovereigns\nlearn to govern their people upon principles of homogenity of interests,\nnatural good will, and fraternal feeling? Alas! we have reason to fear,\nnever. It seems nations are to be governed always by setting up one\nportion of the people against the other.\n\nMuley Abd Errahman was chosen by his uncle, on account of his pacific\nand frugal habits, educated as he was by being made in early life the\nadministrator of the customs in Mogador, and as a prince likely to\npreserve and consolidate the empire. The anticipations of the uncle have\nbeen abundantly realized by the nephew, for Muley Abd Errahman, with the\nexception of the short period of the French hostilities, (which was not\nhis own work and happened in spite of him), has preserved the intact\nwithout, and quiet during the many years he has occupied the throne.\n\nHis Moorish Majesty, who is advanced in life, is a man of middle\nstature. He has dark and expressive eyes, and, as already observed, is a\nmulatto of a fifth caste. Colour excites no prejudices either in the\nsovereign or in the subject. This Emperor is so simple in his habits and\ndress, that he can only be distinguished from his officers and governors\nof provinces by the _thall_, or parasol, the Shereefian emblem of\nroyalty. The Emperor's son, when out on a military expedition, is also\nhonoured by the presence of the Imperial parasol, which was found in\nSidi Mohammed's tent at the Battle of Isly. Muley Abd Errahman is not\ngiven to excesses of any kind, (unless avarice is so considered), though\nhis three harems of Fas, Miknas, and Morocco may be _stocked_, or more\npolitely, adorned, with a thousand ladies or so, and the treasures of\nthe empire are at his disposal. He is not a man of blood; [4] he rarely\ndecapitates a minister or a governor, notwithstanding that he frequently\nconfiscates their property, and sometimes imprisons them to discover\ntheir treasures, and drain them of their last farthing. The Emperor\nlives on good terms with the rest of his family. He has one son,\nGovernor of Fez (Sidi Mohammed), and another son, Governor of Rabat. The\ngreater part of the royal family reside at Tafilett, the ancient country\nof the _Sherfah_, or Shereefs, and is still especially appropriated for\ntheir residence. Ali Bey reported as the information of his time, that\nthere were at Tafilett no less than two thousand Shereefs, who all\npretended to have a right to the throne of Morocco, and who, for that\nreasons enjoyed certain gratifications paid them by the reigning Sultan.\nHe adds that, during an interregnum, many of them took up arms and threw\nthe empire into anarchy. This state of things is happily past, and, as\nto the number of the Shereefs at Tafilett, all that we know is, there is\na small fortified town, inhabited entirely by Shereefs, living in\nmoderate, if not impoverished circumstances.\n\nThe Shereefian Sultans of Morocco are not only the successors of the\nArabian Sovereigns of Spain, but may justly dispute the Caliphat with\nthe Osmanlis, or Turkish Sultans. Their right to be the chiefs of\nIslamism is better founded than the pretended Apostolic successors at\nRome, who, in matters of religion, they in some points resemble.\n\nI introduce here, with some unimportant variations, a translation from\nGraeberg de Hemso of the Imperial Shereefian pedigree, to correspond with\nthe genealogical tableaux, which the reader will find in succeeding\npages, of the Moorish dynasties of Tunis and Tripoli.\n\n\nGENEALOGY OF THE REIGNING DYNASTY OF MOROCCO.\n\n1. Ali-Ben-Abou-Thaleb; died in 661 of the Christian Era; surnamed \"The\naccepted of God,\" of the most ancient tribe of Hashem, and husband of\nFatima, styled Ey-Zarah, or, \"The Pearl,\" only daughter of Mahomet.\n\n2. Hosein, or El-Hosein-es-Sebet, _i.e._ \"The Nephew;\" died in 1680;\nfrom him was derived the patronymic El-Hoseinee, which all the Shereefs\nbear,\n\n3. Hasan-el-Muthna, _i.e._ \"The Striker;\" died in 719; brother of\nMohammed, from whom pretended to descend, in the 16th degree, Mohammed\nBen Tumert, founder of the dynasty of the Almohadi, in 1120.\n\n4. Abdullah-el-Kamel, _i.e._ \"The Perfect;\" in 752, father of Edris, the\nprogenitor or founder of the dynasty of the Edristi in Morocco, and who\nhad six brothers.\n\n5. Mohammed, surnamed \"The pious and just soul;\" in 784, had five\nchildren who were the branches of a numerous family. (Between Mohammed\nand El-Hasem who follows, some assert that three gererations succeeded).\n\n6. El-Kasem, in 852; brother of Abdullah, from whom it is said the\nCaliphs of Egypt and Morocco are descended.\n\n7. Ismail; about 890.\n\n8. Ahmed; in 901.\n\n9. El-Hasan; in 943.\n\n10. Ali; in 970, (excluded from the genealogy published by Ali Bey, but\nnoted by several good authorities).\n\n11. Abubekr; 996.\n\n12. El-Husan, in 1012.\n\n13. Abubekr El-Arfat, _i.e._ \"The Knower,\" in 1043.\n\n14. Mohammed, in 1071.\n\n15. Abdullah, in 1109.\n\n16. Hasan, in 1132; brother of a Mohammed, who emigrated to Morocco.\n\n17. Mohammed, in 1174.\n\n18. Abou-el-Kasem Abd Errahman, in 1207.\n\n19. Mohammed, in 1236.\n\n20. El-Kaseru, in 1271, brother of Ahmed, who also emigrated into\nAfrica, and was father of eight children, one of whom was:\n\n21. El-Hasan, who, in 1266, upon the demand of a tribe of Berbers of\nMoghrawa, was sent by his father into the kingdom of Segelmesa (now\nTafilett) and Draha, where, through his descendants, he became the\ncommon progenitor of the Maroquine Shereefs.\n\n22. Mohammed, in 1367.\n\n23. El-Hasan, in 1391, by his son, Mohammed, he became grandfather of\nHosem, who, during 1507, founded the first dynasty of the Hoseinee\nShereefs in Segelmesa, and the extreme south of Morocco, which dynasty,\nafter twelve years, made itself master of the kingdom of Morocco.\n\n24. Ali-es-Shereef, _i.e._ \"The noble,\" died in 1437, was the first to\nassume this name, and had, after forty years elapsed, two sons, the\nfirst, Muley Mahommed, by a concubine, and the second:\n\n25. Yousef, by a legitimate wife; he retired into Arabia, where he died\nin 1485. It was said of Yousef, that no child was born to him until his\neightieth year, when he had five children, the first born of which was,\n\n26. Ali, who died in 1527, and had at least, eighty male children.\n\n27. Mohammed, in 1691, brother of Muley Meherrez, a famous brigand, and\nafterwards a king of Tafilett: this Mohammed was father of many\nchildren, and among the rest--\n\n28. Ali, who was called by his uncle from Zambo (?) into\nMoghrele-el-Aksa Morocco about the year 1620, and died in 1632, after\nhaving founded the second, and present, dynasty of the Hoseinee\nShereefs, surnamed the _Filei_,\n\n29. Muley Shereeff, died in 1652; he had eighty sons, and a hundred\nand twenty-four daughters.\n\n30. Muley Ismail, in 1727.\n\n31. Muley Abdullah, in 1757.\n\n32. Sidi Mohammed, in 1789.\n\n33. Muley Yezeed, who assumed the surname of El-Mahdee _i.e._ \"the\ndirector,\" in 1792.\n\n34. Muley Hisham, in 1794.\n\n35. Muley Suleiman, in 1822.\n\n36. Muley Abd Errahman, nephew of Muley Suleiman and eldest son of\nMuley Hisham, the reigning Shereefian prince. [5]\n\nIn the Shereefian lineage of Muley Suleiman, copied for Ali Bey by the\nEmperor himself, and which is very meagre and unsatisfactory, we miss\nthe names of the two brothers, the Princes Yezeed and Hisham, who\ndisputed the succession on the death of their father, Sidi Mohammed\nwhich happened in April 1790 or 1789, when the Emperor was on a military\nexpedition to quell the rebellion of his son, Yezeed--the tyrant whose\nbad fame and detestable cruelties filled with horror all the North\nAfrican world. The Emperor Suleiman evidently suppressed these names, as\ndisfiguring the lustre of the holy pedigree; although Yezeed was the\nhereditary prince, and succeeded his father three days after his death,\nbeing proclaimed Sultan at Salee with accustomed pomp and magnificence.\nThis monster in human shape, having excited a civil war against himself\nby his horrid barbarities, was mortally wounded by a poisoned arrow,\nshot from a secret hand, and died in February 1792, the 22nd month of\nhis reign, and 44th year of his age.\n\nOn being struck with the fatal weapon, he was carried to his palace at\nDar-el-Beida, where he only survived a single day; but yet during this\nbrief period, and whilst in the agony of dissolution, it is said, the\ntyrant committed more crimes and outrages, and caused more people to be\nsacrificed, than in his whole lifetime, determining with the vengeance\nof a pure fiend, that if his people would not weep for his death they\nshould mourn for the loss of their friends and relations, like the old\ntyrant Herod. How instinctively imitative is crime! Yezeed was of\ncourse, not buried at the cross-roads, (Heaven forefend!) or in a\ncemetery for criminals and infidels, for being a Shereef, and divine\n(not royal) blood running in his veins, he was interred with great\nsolemnities at the mosque of _Kobah Sherfah_ (tombs of the Shereefs),\nbeside the mausoleums wherein repose the awful ashes of the princes and\nkings, who, in ages gone by, have devastated the Empire of Morocco, and\ninflicted incalculable miseries on its unfortunate inhabitants, whilst\nplenarily exercising their divine right, to do wrong as sovereigns, or\nas invested with inviolable Shereefian privileges as lineal successors\nof the Prophets of God! [6]\n\nA civil war still followed this monster's death, and the empire was rent\nand partitioned into three portions, in each of which a pretender\ndisputed for the possession of the Shereefian throne. The poor people\nhad now three tyrants for one. The two grand competitors, however, were\nMuley Hisham, who was proclaimed Sultan in the south at Morrocco and\nSous, and Muley Suleiman, who was saluted as Emperor in the north at\nFez. In 1795, Hisham retired to a sanctuary where he soon died, and then\nMuley Suleimau was proclaimed in the southern provinces\nEmir-el-Monmeneen, and Sultan of the whole empire.\n\nMuley Suleiman proved to be a good and patriotic prince, \"the Shereef of\nShereefs,\" whilst he maintained, by a just administration, tranquility\nin his own state, and cultivated peace with Europe. During his long\nreign of a quarter of a century, at a period when all the Christian\npowers were convulsed with war, he wisely remained neutral, and his\nsubjects were happy in the enjoyment of peace and prosperity. He died on\nthe 28th March 1820, about the 50th year of his age, after having, with\nhis last breath declared his nephew, Muley Abd Errahman, the legitimate\nand hereditary successor of the Shereefs, and so restoring the lineal\ndescent of these celebrated Mussulman sovereigns. The most glorious as\nwell as the most beneficent and acceptable act of the reign of Muley\nSuleiman, so far as European nations were concerned, was the abolition\nof Christian slavery in his States. In former times, the Maroquine\nMoors, smarting under the ills inflicted upon them by Spain and\nbreathing revenge, subjected their Christian captives to more cruel\nbondage, than, ever were experienced by the same victims of the Corsairs\nin Algeria, the stronghold of this nefarious trade.\n\nThe Shereefs have been accustomed to wrap themselves up in their sublime\nindifference, as to the fate and fortunes of Europe. During late\ncenturies, their diplomatic intercourse with European princes has been\nscarcely relieved by a single interesting event, beyond their piratical\nwars and our complaisant redemptions of their prisoners. But, in the\nreign of Louis XIV., Muley Ismail having heard an extremely seductive\naccount of the Princesse de Conti (Mademoiselle de Blois), natural\ndaughter of the Grand Monarch and Mademoiselle de la Valliere, by means\nof his ambassador, Abdullah Ben Aissa, had the chivalrous temerity to\ndemand her in marriage. \"Our Sultan,\" said the ambassador, \"will marry\nher according to the law of God and the Prophet, but she shall not be\nforced to abandon her religion, or manner of living; and she will be\nable to find all that her heart desires in the palace of my\nsovereign--if it please God.\"\n\nThis request, of course, could not be granted, but the \"king of\nChristian kings\" replied very graciously, \"that the difference alone of\nreligion prevented the consummation of the happiness of the Shereef of\nShereefs.\" This humble demand of the hand of the princess mightily\namused \"the Court of Courts,\" and its hireling poets taxed their wit to\nthe utmost in chanting the praises of the royal virgin, who had attacked\nthe regards (or the growls) of the Numidian Tiger, as Muley Ismail was\npolitely designated. Take this as a specimen,--\n\n  \"Votre beaute, grande princesse,\n  Porte les traits dont elle blesse\n  Jusques aux plus sauvages lieux:\n  L'Afrique avec vous capitule,\n  Et les conquetes de vos yeux\n  Vont plus loin que celles d'Hercule.\"\n\nThe Maroquine ambassador, who was also grand admiral of the Moorish\nnavy, witnessing all the wonders of Paris at the epoch of the Great\nMonarch, was dazzled with its beauty and magnificence; nevertheless, he\nremained a good Mussulman. He was besides a grateful man, for he saw our\nJames II. in exile, who had given the admiral liberty without ransom\nwhen he had been captured by English cruisers, and heartily thanked the\nfallen prince for his own freedom whilst he condoled with him in his\nmisfortunes. But the Moorish envoy, in spite of his great influence, was\nunable to conclude the treaty of peace, which was desired by France. On\nhis return to Morocco, the ambassador had so advanced in European ideas\nof convenience, or civilization, that he attempted to introduce a taste\nfor Parisian luxury among his own countrymen.\n\nAs in many other parts of the Mediterranean, France and England have\nincessantly contended for influence at the Court of Morocco. Various\nirregular missions to this Court have been undertaken by European\npowers, from the first establishment of the Moorish empire of the West.\nThe French entered regularly into relations with the western Moors\nshortly after us; their flag, indeed, began to appear at their ports in\n1555, under Francis I. They succeeded in gaining the favour of the Moors\nwhilst we occupied Tangier, and Louis XIV. encouraged them in their\nefforts to attack or harass our garrison. The nature of our struggles\nwith the Moors of Morocco can be at once conjectured from the titles of\nthe pamphlets published in those times, viz.\n\n\"_Great_ and _bloody_ news of Tangier,\" (London 1680), and \"The Moors\n_blasted_, being a discourse concerning Tangier, especially when it was\nunder the Earl of Teviot,\" (London, 1681). But, after the peace of\nUtrecht, conceding Gibraltar to England, and which more than compensated\nus for the loss of Tangier, the influence of France in Morocco began to\nwane, and the trade of this empire was absorbed by the British during\nthe 18th century. Then, in the beginning of our own age, the battle of\nTrafalgar, and the fall of Napoleon, established the supremacy of\nBritish influence over the minds of the Shereefs, which has not been yet\nentirely effaced.\n\nOur diplomatic intercouse has been more frequent and interesting with\nthe Western Moors since the French occupation of Algeria, and we have\nexerted our utmost to neutralize the spirit of the war party in Fez,\nseconding the naturally pacific mind of Muley Abd Errahman, in order to\nremove every pretext of the French for invading this country. How we\nsucceeded in a critical period will be mentioned at the close of the\npresent work. [7] But this port, and our influence receiving thereby a\ngreat shock, I am happy to state that the latest account from this most\ninteresting Moorish country, represents Muley Abd Errahman as steadily\npursuing, by the assistance of his new vizier, Bouseilam, the most\npacific policy. This minister, being very rich, is enabled to\nconsolidate his power by frequent presents to his royal master, thus\ngratifying the most darling passion of Muley Abd Errahman, and Vizier\nand Sultan amuse themselves by undertaking plundering expeditions\nagainst insurrectionary tribes, whose sedition they first stimulate, and\nthen quell, that is to say, by receiving from the unlucky rebels a\nhandsome gratification.\n\nThe late Mr. Hay entered into a correspondence with the Shereefian Court\nfor the purpose of drawing its attention to the subject of the\nslave-trade, and I shall make an extract or two from the letters,\nbearing as they do on my present mission.\n\nFrom three letters addressed by the Sultan to Mr. Hay, I extract the\nfollowing passages. \"Be it known to you, that the traffic in slaves is a\nmatter on which all sects and nations have agreed from the time of the\nsons of Adam, (on whom be the peace of God up to this day). And we are\nnot yet aware of its being prohibited by the laws of any sect, and no\none need ask this question, the same being manifest to both high and\nlow, and requires no more demonstration than the light of the day.\"\n\nThe Apostle of God is quoted as enforcing upon the master to give his\nslave the same clothing as himself, and not to exact more labour from\nhim than he can perform.\n\nAnother letter. \"It has been prohibited to sell a Muslem, the sacred\n_misshaf_, and a young person to an unbeliever,\" that is to any one who\ndoes not profess the faith of Islam, whether Christian, Jew, or Majousy.\nTo make a present, or to give as in alms is held in the same light as a\nsale. The said Sheikh Khalil also says, \"a slave is emancipated by the\nlaw if ill-treated, that is, whether he intends or does actually\nill-treat him. But whether a slave can take with him what he possesses\nof property or no, is a matter yet undecided by the doctors of the law.\"\n\nAnother. \"Be it known to you, that the religion of Islam--may God exalt\nit! has a solid foundation, of which the corner stones are well secured,\nand the perfection whereof has been made known to us by God, to whom\nbelongs all praise in his book, the Forkam (or Koran,) which admits\nneither of addition nor diminution. As regards the making of slaves and\ntrading therewith, it is confirmed by our book, as also of the _Sunnat_\n(or traditions) of our Prophet. There is no controversy among the\n_Oulamma_ (doctors) on the subject. No one can allow what is prohibited\nor prohibit that which is lawful.\"\n\nThese extracts shew the _animus_ of the Shereefian correspondence. To\nattack the Shereefs on this point of slavery, is to besiege the citadel\nof their religion, or that is the interpretation which they are pleased\nto put upon the matter; but all forms of bigotry and false principles\nwill ultimately succumb to the force of truth.\n\nIt is necessary to persevere, to persevere always, and the end will be\nobtained.\n\nI shall add a word or two on our treaties, or capitulations, as they are\ndisgracefully called, with the Empire of Morocco, intimating, as they\ndo, our former submission to the arrogant, piratical demands of the\nBarbary Powers in the days of their corsair glory. Our political\nrelations with Morocco officially commenced in the times of Elizabeth,\nor Charles I; but the formal treaty of peace was not concluded until the\nlast year of the reign of George I, which was ratified in 1729 by George\nII, and by the Sultan Muley Ahmed-elt-Thabceby \"The golden.\" Then\nfollowed various other treaties for the security of persons and trade,\nand against piracy. All, however, of any value, are embodied in the\ntreaty between Great Britain and Morocco, signed at Fez, 14th June 1801,\nand confirmed, 19th January 1824 by the Sultan Muley Suleiman, which is\nconsidered as still in force, and from which I shall extract two or\nthree articles, appending observations, for the purpose of shewing its\nspirit and bearing on European commerce and civilization. Common sense\ntells us that trade can only flourish where there is security for life\nand property. We have to examine, whether this security is fully\nguaranteed to British subjects, residing in and trading with the empire\nto Morocco, by the treaty of 1801 and 1824.\n\nThis treaty begins with consuls, and sufficiently provides for their\nhonour and safety. It then states the privilege of British subjects, and\nmore particulary of merchants, residing in, and wishing to engage in\ncommercial speculations in Morocco. These privileges are, on the whole,\nalso explicitly stated. Afterwards follows two articles on \"disputes,\"\nwhich clauses were amended and explained in January 1824, when the\ntreaty was confirmed. These are:--\n\n\"VII. Disputes between Moorish subjects and English subjects, shall be\ndecided in the presence of the English Consuls, provided the decision be\ncomformable to the Moorish law, in which case the English subject shall\nnot go before the Kady or Hakem, as the Consul's decision shall suffice.\n\n\"VIII. Should any dispute occur between English subjects and Moors, and\nthat dispute should occasion a complaint from either of the parties, the\nEmperor of Morocco shall only decide the matter. If the English subject\nbe guilty, he shall not be punished with more severity than a Moor would\nbe; should he escape, no other subject of the English nation shall be\narrested in his stead, and if the escape be made after the decision, in\norder to avoid punishment, he shall be sentenced as a Moor would be who\nhad committed the same crime. Should any dispute occur in the English\nterritories, between a Moor and an English subject, it shall be decided\nby an equal number of the Moors residing there and of Christians,\naccording to the custom of the place, if not contrary to the Moorish\nlaw.\"\n\nIn the amended clause of Article VIII. We have for any complaint,\nsubstituted serious personal injury, and I cannot but observe that the\nmaking of the Emperor the final judge, in such case, is a stretch of too\ngreat confidence in Moorish justice.\n\nNot that a Sultan of Morocco is necessarily bad or worse than an\nEuropean Sovereign, but because a personage of such power and character,\narmed with unbounded attributes of despotism over his own subjects, who\nare considered his Abeed, or slaves, whilst feebly aided by the\nperception of the common rights of men, and imperfectly acquainted with\nEuropean civilization, can never, unless, indeed by accident or miracle,\njustly decide upon the case of an Englishman, or upon a dispute between\nhis own and a foreign subject; for besides the ideas and education of\nthe Emperor, there is the necessity which his Imperial Highness feels,\ndespot as he is, of exhibiting himself before his people as their\nundoubted friend and partial judge.\n\nSo strongly have Sultans of Morocco felt this, that many anecdotes might\nbe cited where the Emperor has indemnified the foreigner for injury done\nto him by his own subjects, whilst he has represented to them that he\nhas decided the case against the stranger. It is surprising how a\nBritish Government could surrender the settlement of the dispute of\ntheir subjects to the final appeal of the Court of Morocco in the\nnineteenth century, and, moreover, allow them to be decided, according\nto the maxims of the Mohammedan code, or comformable to the Moorish law!\nIt is not long ago since, indeed just before my arrival in Morocco, that\nthe Emperor decided a dispute in rather a summary manner, without even\nthe usual Moorish forms of judicial proceedure by decapitating, a\nquasi--European Jew, under French protection, and who once acted as the\nConsul of France.\n\nThere is something singularly deficient and wrong, although to persons\nunacquainted with Barbary, it looks sufficiently fair and just, in the\nprovision--\"he (the English guilty subject) shall not be punished with\nmore severity than a Moor could be,\" fairly made? In the first place,\nalthough this does not come under the idea of \"serious personal injury,\"\nwould the English people approve of their countrymen suffering the same\npunishment as the Moors for theft, by cutting off their right hand?\nMoors and Arabs have been so maimed for life, on being convicted of\nstealing property to the value of a single shilling! Who will take upon\nhimself to enumerate the punishments, which may be, and are inflicted\nfor grave offences? It may be replied that this stipulation of punishing\nBritish subjects, like Moorish, is only on paper, and we have no\nexamples of its being put into execution. I rejoin, without attempting\nto cite proof, that, whilst such an article exists in a treaty, said to\nbe binding on the Government of England as well as Morocco, there can be\nno real security for British subjects in this country; for in the event\nof the Maroquines acting strictly upon the articles of this treaty, what\nmode of inculpation, or what colour of right, can the British Government\nadopt or shew against them? and what are treaties made for, if they do\nnot bind both parties?\n\nIn illustration of the way in which British subjects have their disputes\nsometimes settled, according to Articles VII and VIII, I take the\nliberty of introducing the case of Mr. Saferty, a respectable Gibraltar\nmerchant, settled at Mogador. A few months before my arrival in that\nplace, this gentleman was adjudged, in the presence of his Consul, Mr.\nWillshire, and the Governor of Mogador, for repelling an insult offered\nto him by a Moor, and sentenced to be imprisoned with felons and\ncut-throats in a horrible dungeon. However, Mr. Saferty was attended by\na numerous body of his friends; so when the sentence was given, a cry of\nindignation arose, a scuffle ensued, and the prisoner was rescued from\nthe Moorish police-officers. Mr. Willshire found the means of patching\nup the business with the Moorish authorities, and the case was soon\nforgotten. \"All's well that ends well.\"\n\nI do not say that the Moors are determinedly vindictive, or seek\nquarrels with Europeans; on the contrary, I believe the cause of the\ndispute frequently rests with the European, and the bona-fide agressor,\nsome adventurer whose conduct was so bad in his own country, that he\nsought Barbary as a refuge from the pursuit of the minister of justice.\nWhat I wish to lay stress on is, the enormous power given to the\nEmperor, by a solemn treaty, in making him the final judge, and the\nimminent exposure of British subjects to the barbarous punishments of a\nsemi-civilized people.\n\nArticle X is a most singular one. \"Renegades from the English nation, or\nsubjects who change their religion to embrace the Moorish, they being of\nunsound mind at the time of turning Moors, shall not be admitted as\nMoors, and may again return to their former religion; but if they\nafterwards resolve to be Moors, they must abide by their own decision,\nand their excuses will not be accepted.\"\n\nIt was a wonderful discovery of our modern morale, that a renegade,\nbeing a madman, should not be considered a renegade in earnest, or\nresponsible for his actions. Nevertheless, these unfortunate beings,\nshould they have better thoughts, or as mad-doctors have it, \"a lucid\ninterval,\" and leave the profession of the Mahometan faith, and\nafterwards again relapse into madness, and turn Mahometans once more,\nare doomed to irretrievable slavery, or if they relapse, to death\nitself; the Mahometan law, punishes relapsing renegades with death. This\ncurious clause says, \"that though being madmen, they must abide their\ndecision (of unreason) and their excuses will not be accepted.\" This\nsaid article was confirmed as late as the year 1824 by the\nplenipotentiary of a nation, which boasts of being the most free and\ncivilized of Europe, and whose people spend annually millions for the\nconversion of the heathen, and the extinction of the slave-trade.\n\nThe last clause of Article IV also demands our attention, viz. \"And if\nany English merchant should happen to have a vessel in or outside the\nport, he may go on board himself, or any of his people, without being\nliable to pay anything whatever.\"\n\nNow in spite of this (but of course forgotten) stipulation, the\nmerchants of Mogador are not permitted to visit their own vessels, nor\nthose of other persons which may happen to be in or outside the port. It\nis true, the authorities plead the reason of their refusal to be, \"The\nmerchants are indebted to the Emperor:\" neither will the authorities\ntake any security, and arbitrarily, and insolently prohibit, under any\ncircumstances, the merchants from visiting their vessels. I have said\nenough to shew that our treaties (I beg the reader's pardon,\n\"capitulations\") with the Emperor of Morocco, require immediate\nrevision, and to be amended with articles more suited to the spirit of\nthe age, and European civilization, as likewise more consistent with the\ndignity of Great Britian.\n\nThe treaty for the supply of provisions, especially cattle, to the\ngarrison of Gibraltar is either a verbal one, or a secret arrangement,\nfor no mention is made of it in the published state paper documents. It\nis probably a mere verbal unwritten understanding, but, neverthelesss is\nmore potent in its working than the written treaties. This is not the\nfirst time that the unwritten has proved stronger than the written\nengagement.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nThe two different aspects by which the strength and resources of the\nEmpire of Morocco may be viewed or estimated.--Native appellation of\nMorocco.--Geographical limits of this country.--Historical review of the\ninhabitants of North Africa, and the manner in which this region was\nsuccessively peopled and conquered.--The distinct varieties of the human\nrace, as found in Morocco.--Nature of the soil and climate of this\ncountry.--Derem, or the Atlas chain of mountains.--Natural\nproducts.--The Shebbel, or Barbary salmon; different characters of\nexports of the Northern and Southern provinces.--The Elaeonderron\nArgan.--Various trees and plants.--Mines.--The Sherb-Errech, or\nDesert-horse.\n\n\nThe empire of Morocco may be considered under two aspects, as to its\nextent, and as to its influence. It may be greatly circumscribed or\nexpanded to an almost indefinite extent, according to the feelings, or\nimagination, of the writer, or speaker. A resident here gave me a meagre\n_tableau_, something like this,\n\n  The city of Morocco    50,000 souls.\n        \"     Fez        40,000   \"\n        \"     Mequinez   25,000   \"\n                        -------\n                        115,000   \"\n\nThe maritime cities contain little more than 100,000 inhabitants, making\naltogether about 220,000. Over the provinces of the south, Sous and\nWadnoun, the Sultan has no real power; so the south is cut off as an\nintegral portion of the empire. Over the Rif, or the northern Berber\nprovinces, the Sultan exercises a precarious sovereignty, every man's\ngun or knife is there his law and authority. Fez contains a disaffected\npopulation, teeming some years since with the adherents of Abd-el-Kader.\nThen the Atlas is full of quasi-independent Berber tribes, who detest\nequally the Arabs and the Moorish government; finally, Tafilett and the\nprovinces on the eastern side of the Atlas, are too remote to feel the\ninfluence of the central government.\n\nAs to military force, the Emperor's standing army does not amount to\nmore than 20 or 30,000 Nigritian troops, and all cavalry. The irregular\nand contingent cavalry and infantry can never be depended upon, even\nunder such a chief as Abd-el-Kader was. They must always be fed, but\nthey will not, at any summons, leave the cultivation of their fields, or\ntheir wives and children defenceless.\n\nAs to the commerce of the Empire, with fifty ships visiting Mogador and\nother maritime cities, the amount, per annum, does not exceed forty\nmillions of francs, or about a million and a half sterling including\nimports and exports. Such is the view of the Empire on the depreciating\nside.\n\nAnother resident of this country gives the opposite or more favourable\nview.\n\nThe Sultan is the head of the orthodox religion of the Mussulmen of the\nWest, and more firmly established on his throne than the Sultan of the\nOttomans. His influence, as a sovereign Shereef, spreads throughout\nWestern Barbary and Central Africa, wherever there is a Mussulman to be\nfound. In the event of an enemy appearing in the shape of a Christian,\nor Infidel, all would unite, including the most disjointed and hostile\ntribes against the common foe of Islamism.\n\nThe Sultan, upon an emergency or insurrection in his own empire, by the\npolitic distribution of titles of _Marabout_ (often used as a species of\ndegree of D.D.) and other honours attached to the Shereefian Parasol,\ncan likewise easily excite one chief against another, and consolidate\nhis power over their intestine divisions. His Moorish Majesty, at any\nrate, has always actual possession in his favour; and, whether he really\ngoverns the whole Empire or not, or to the extent which he has presumed\nto mark out its boundaries, he can always proclaim to his disjointed\nprovinces that he does so govern it and exercise authority; and, in\ngeneral, he does succeed in making both his own people and foreign\nnations believe in his pretensions, and acknowledge his power.\n\nThe truth lies, perhaps, between these extremes. The Shereefs once\npretended to exercise authority over all Western Sahara as far as\nTimbuctoo, that is to say, all that region of the great desert lying\nwest of the Touaricks.\n\nThe account of the expedition of the Shereef Mohammed, who penetrated as\nfar as Wadnoun, and which took place more than three centuries ago, as\nrelated by Marmol, leaves no doubt of the ancient ambition of the\nsovereign of Morocco. And although this pretension has now been given\nup, they still claim sovereignty over the oases of Touat, a month's\njourney in the Sahara. Formerly, indeed, the authority of the Maroquine\nSultans over Touat and the south appears to have been more real and\neffective.\n\nDiego de Torres relates that, in his time, the Shereefs maintained a\nforce of ten thousand cavalry in the provinces of Draha, Tafilett and\nJaguriri, and Monsieur Mouette counts Touat as one of the provinces of\nthe Empire. The Sheikh Haj Kasem, in the itinerary which he dictated to\nMonsieur Delaporte, says that, about forty years ago, Agobli and\nTaoudeni depended on Morocco. This, however, is what the people of\nGhadames told me, whilst they admitted that the oases neither did\ncontain a single officer of the Emperor, nor did the people pay his\nShereefian Highness the smallest impost. The Sultan's authority is now\nindeed purely nominal, and the French look forward to the time when\nthese fine and centrally placed oases will form \"une dependance de\nl'Algerie.\"\n\nThe only countries in the South which now pay a regular impost to the\nEmperor, are Tafilett, limited to the valley of Fez, Wad-Draha as far as\nthe lake Ed-Debaia, and Sous. The countries of Sidi, Hashem, and Wadnoun\nnominally acknowledge the Emperor, and occasionally send a present; but\nthe most mountainous, between Sous and Wad-Draha, which has been called\nGuezoula or Gouzoula, and is said to be peopled by a Berber race, sprang\nfrom the ancient Gelulir, is entirely independent. In the north and west\nare also many quasi-independent tribes, but still the Emperor keeps up a\nsort of authority over them; and, if nothing more, is content simply\nwith being called their Sultan.\n\nMaroquine Moors call their country El-Gharb, \"The West,\" and sometimes\nMogrel-el-Aksa, that is \"The far West:\" [8] the name seems to have\noriginated something in the same way among the Saracenic conquerors, as\nthe \"Far West\" with the Anglo-Americans, arising from an apprehensive\nfeeling of indefinite extent of unexplored country. Among the Moors\ngenerally, Morocco is now often called, \"Blad Muley Abd Errahman\", or\n\"Country of the Sultan Muley Abd Errahman.\" The northwestern portion of\nMorocco was first conquered; Morocco Proper, Sous and Tafilett were\nadded with the progress of conquest. But scarcely a century has elapsed\nsince their union under one common Sultan, whilst the diverse population\nof the four States are solely kept together by the interests and\nfeelings of a common religion.\n\nThe Maroquine Empire, with its present limits, is bounded on the north\nby the Mediterranean Sea and the Straits of Gibraltar, on the west by\nthe Atlantic Ocean and the Canary and Madeira Islands, on the south by\nthe deserts of Noun Draha and the Sahara, on the east by Algeria, the\nAtlas, and Tafilett, on the borders of Sahara beyond their eastern\n<DW72>s. The greatest length from north to south is about five hundred\nmiles, with a breadth from east to west varying considerably at an\naverage of two hundred, containing an available or really _dependent_\nterritory of some 137,400 square miles, or nearly as large as Spain; and\nthe whole is situate between the 28 deg. and 40 deg. N. Latitude. Monsieur\nBenou, in his \"Description Geographique de l'Empire de Maroc\" says\nMorocco \"comprend une superficie d'environ 5,775 myriametres carres, un\npeu plus grande, par consequant, que celle de la France, qui equivaut a\n5,300.\" This then is the available and immediate territory of Morocco,\nnot comprising distant dependencies, where the Shereefs exercise a\nprecarious or nominal sovereignty.\n\nPreviously to particularizing the population of Morocco, I shall take\nthe liberty of introducing some general observations on the whole of the\ninhabitants of North Africa, and the manner in which this country was\nsuccessively peopled and conquered. Greek and Roman classics contain\nonly meagre and confused notions of the aborigines of North Africa,\nalthough they have left us a mass of details on the Punic wars, and the\nstruggles which ensued between the Romans and the ancient Libyans,\nbefore the domination of the Latin Republic could be firmly established.\nHerodotus cites the names of a number of people who inhabited North\nAfrica, mostly confining himself to repeat the fables or the more\ninteresting facts, of which they were the object.\n\nThe nomenclature of Strabo is neither so extensive, nor does it contain\nmore precise or correct information. He mentions the celebrated oasis of\nAmmonium and the nation of the Nasamones. Farther west, behind Carthage\nand the Numidians, he also notices the Getulians, and after them the\nGaramantes, a people who appear to have colonized both the oasis of\nGhadames and the oases of Fezzan. Ptolemy makes the whole of the\nMauritania, including Algeria and Morocco, to be bounded on the south by\ntribes, called Gaetuliae and Melanogaeluti, on the south the latter\nevidently having contracted alliance of blood with the <DW64>s.\n\nAccording to Sallust, who supports himself upon the authority of\nHeimpsal, the Carthaginian historian, \"North Africa was first occupied\nby Libyans and Getulians, who were a barbarous people, a heterogeneous\nmass, or agglomeration of people of different races, without any form of\nreligion or government, nourishing themselves on herbs, or devouring the\nraw flesh of animals killed in the chase; for first amongst these were\nfound Blacks, probably some from the interior of Africa, and belonging\nto the great <DW64> family; then whites, issue of the Semitic stock, who\napparently constituted, even at that early period, the dominant race or\ncaste. Later, but at an epoch absolutely unknown, a new horde of\nAsiatics,\" says Sallust, \"of Medes, Persians, and Armenians, invaded the\ncountries of the Atlas, and, led on by Hercules, pushed their conquests\nas far as Spain.\" [9]\n\nThe Persians, mixing themselves with the former inhabitants of the\ncoast, formed the tribes called Numides, or Numidians (which embrace the\nprovinces of Tunis and Constantina), whilst the Medes and the Armenians,\nallying themselves with the Libyans, nearer to Spain, it is pretended,\ngave existence to a race of Moors, the term Medes being changed into\nthat of Moors. [10]\n\nAs to the Getulians confined in the valleys of the Atlas, they resisted\nall alliance with the new immigrants, and formed the principal nucleus\nof those tribes who have ever remained in North Africa, rebels to a\nforeign civilization, or rather determined champions of national\nfreedom, and whom, imitating the Romans and Arabs, we are pleased to\ncall Barbarians or Berbers (Barbari Braber [11]), and whence is derived\nthe name of the Barbary States. But the Romans likewise called the\naboriginal tribes of North Africa, Moors, or Mauri, and some contend\nthat Moors and Berbers are but two different names for the aboriginal\ntribes, the former being of Greek and the latter of African origin. The\nRomans might, however, confound the African term berber with barbari,\nwhich latter they applied, like the Greeks, to all strangers and\nforeigners. The revolutions of Africa cast a new tribe of emigrants upon\nthe North African coast, who, if we are to believe the Byzantine\nhistorian, Procopius, of the sixth century, were no other than\nCanaanites, expelled from Palestine by the victorious arms of Joshua,\nwhen he established the Israelites in that country. Procopius affirms\nthat, in his time, there was a column standing at Tigisis, on which was\nthis inscription:--\"We are those who fled from the robber Joshua, son of\nNun.\" [12] Now whether Tigisis was in Algeria, or was modern Tangier, as\nsome suppose, it is certain there are several traditions among the\nBerber tribes of Morocco, which relate that their ancestors were driven\nout of Palestine. Also, the Berber historian, Ebn-Khal-Doun, who\nflourished in the fourteenth century, makes all the Berbers descend from\none Bar, the son of Mayigh, son of Canaan. However, what may be the\ntruths of these traditions of Sallust or Procopius, there is no\ndifficulty in believing that North Africa was peopled by fugitive and\nroving tribes, and that the first settlers should be exposed to be\nplundered by succeeding hordes; for such has been the history of the\nmigrations of all the tribes of the human race.\n\nBut the most ancient historical fact on which we can depend is, the\ninvasion, or more properly, the successive invasions of North Africa by\nthe Phoenicians. Their definite establishment on these shores took place\ntowards the foundation of Carthage, about 820 years before our era. Yet\nwe know little of their intercourse or relations with the aboriginal\ntribes. When the Romans, a century and a half before Christ, received,\nor wrested, the rule of Africa from the Phoenicians, or Carthaginians,\nthey found before them an indigenous people, whom they indifferently\ncalled Moors, Berbers, or Barbarians. A part of these people were called\nalso Nudides, which is perhaps considered the same term as nomades.\n\nSome ages later, the Romans, too weak to resist a vigorous invasion of\nother conquerors, were subjugated by the Vandals, who, during a century,\nheld possession of North Africa; but, after this time, the Romans again\nraised their heads, and completely expelled or extirpated the Vandals,\nso that, as before, there were found only two people or races in Africa:\nthe Romans and the Moors, or aborigines.\n\nTowards the middle of the seventh century after Christ, and a few years\nafter the death of Mahomet, the Romans, in the decline of their power,\nhad to meet the shock of the victorious arms of the Arabians, who poured\nin upon them triumphant from the East; but, too weak to resist this new\ntide of invasion, they opposed to them the aborigines, which latter were\nsoon obliged to continue alone the struggle.\n\nThe Arabian historians, who recount these wars, speak of _Roumi_ or\nRomans (of the Byzantine empire) and the Braber--evidently the\naboriginal tribes--who promptly submitted to the Arabs to rid themselves\nof the yoke of the Romans; but, after the retreat of their ancient\nmasters, they revolted and remained a long time in arms against their\nnew conquerors--a rule of action which all subjugated nations have been\nwont to follow. Were we English now to attempt to expel the French from\nAlgeria, we, undoubtedly, should be joined by the Arabs; but who would,\nmost probably, soon also revolt against us, were we to attempt to\nconsolidate our dominion over them.\n\nIn the first years of the eighth century, and at the end of the first\ncentury of the Hegira, the conquering Arabs passed over to Spain, and,\ninasmuch as they came from Mauritania, the people of Spain gave them the\nname of Moors (that of the aborigines of North Africa), although they\nhad, perhaps, nothing in common with them, if we except their Asiatic\norigin. Another and most singular name was also given to these Arab\nwarriors in France and other parts of Europe--that of Saracens--whose\netymology is extremely obscure. [13] From this time the Spaniards have\nalways given the names of Moors (_los Moros_), not only to the Arabs of\nSpain, but to all the Arabs; and, confounding farther these two\ndenominations, they have bestowed the name of _Moros_ upon the Arabs of\nMorocco and those in the environs of Senegal.\n\nThe Arabs who invaded Northern Africa about 650, were all natives of\nAsia, belonging to various provinces of Arabia, and were divided into\nIsmaelites, Amalekites, Koushites, &c. They were all warriors; and it is\nconsidered a title of nobility to have belonged to their first irruption\nof the enthusiastic sons of the Prophet.\n\nA second invasion took place towards the end of the ninth century--an\nepoch full of wars--during which, the Caliph Kaim transported the seat\nof his government from Kairwan to Cairo, ending in the complete\nsubmission of Morocco to the power of Yousef Ben Tashfin. One cannnot\nnow distinguish which tribe of Arabs belong to the first or the second\ninvasion, but all who can shew the slightest proof, claim to belong to\nthe first, as ranking among a band of noble and triumphant warriors.\n\nAfter eight centuries of rule, the Arabs being expelled from Spain, took\nrefuge in Barbary, but instead of finding the hospitality and protection\nof their brethren, the greater part of them were pillaged or massacred.\nThe remnant of these wretched fugitives settled along the coast; and it\nis to their industry and intelligence that we owe the increase, or the\nfoundation of many of the maritime cities. Here, considered as strangers\nand enemies by the natives, whom they detested, the new colonists sought\nfor, and formed relations with Turks and renegades of all nations,\nwhilst they kept themselves separate from the Arabs and Berbers. This,\nthen, is the _bona-fide_ origin of the people whom we now generally call\nMoors. History furnishes us with a striking example of how the expelled\nArabs of Spain united with various adventurers against the Berber and\nNorth African Arabs. In the year 1500, a thousand Andalusian cavaliers,\nwho had emigrated to Algiers, formed an alliance with the Barbarossas\nand their fleet of pirates; and, after expelling the native prince,\nbuilt the modern city of Algiers. And such was the origin of the\nAlgerine Corsairs.\n\nThe general result of these observations would, therefore, lead us to\nconsider the Moors of the Romans, as the Berbers or aborigines of North\nAfrica, and the Moors of the Spaniards, as pure Arabians; and if,\nindeed, these Arabian cavaliers marshalled with them Berbers, as\nauxiliaries, for the conquest of Spain, this fact does not militate\nagainst the broad assumption.\n\nThe so-called Moors of Senegal and the Sahara, as well as those of\nMorocco, are chiefly a mixture of Berbers, Arabs and <DW64>s; but the\npresent Moors located in the northern coast of Africa, are rather the\ndescendants from the various conquering nations, and especially from\nrenegades and Christian slaves.\n\nThe term Moors is not known to the natives themselves. The people speak\ndefinitely enough of Arabs and of various Berber tribes. The population\nof the towns and cities are called generally after the names of these\ntowns and cities, whilst Tuniseen and Tripoline is applied to all the\ninhabitants of the great towns of Tunis and Tripoli. Europeans resident\nin Barbary, as a general rule, call all the inhabitants of towns--Moors,\nand the peasants or people residents in tents--Arabs. But, in Tripoli, I\nfound whole villages inhabited by Arabs, and these I thought might be\ndistinguished as town Arabs. Then the mountains of Tripoli are covered\nwith Arab villages, and some few considerable towns are inhabited by\npeople who are _bona-fide_ Arabs. Finally, the capitals of North Africa\nare filled with every class of people found in the country.\n\nThe question is then where shall we draw the line of distinction in the\ncase of nationalities? or can we, with any degree of precision, define\nthe limits which distinguish the various races in North Africa? With\nregard to the Blacks or <DW64> tribes, there can be no great difficulty.\nThe Jews are also easily distinguished from the rest of the people as\nwell by their national features as by their dress and habits or customs\nof living. But, when we come to the Berbers, Arabs, Moors and Turks, we\ncan only distinguish them in their usual and ordinary occupations and\nmanners of life. Whenever they are intermixed, or whenever they change\ntheir position, that is to say, whenever the Arab or Berber comes to\ndwell in a town, or a Moor or a Turk goes to reside in the country,\nadopting the Arab or Berber dress and mode of living, it is no longer\npossible to distinguish the one from the other, or mark the limitation\nof races.\n\nAnd since it is seen that the aborigines of Northern Africa consisted,\nwith the exception of the <DW64> tribes, of the Asiatics of the Caucasian\nrace or variety, many of whom, like the Phoenicians, have peopled\nvarious cities and provinces of Europe, it is therefore not astonishing\nwe should find all the large towns and cities of North Africa, where the\nhuman being becomes _policed_, refined and civilized sooner than in\nremote and thinly-inhabited districts, teeming with a population, which\nat once challenges an European type, and a corresponding origin with the\ngreat European family of nations.\n\nNorth Africa is wonderfully homogeneous in the matter of religion. The\npeople, indeed, have but one religion. Even the extraneous Judaism is\nthe same in its Deism--depression of the female--circumcision and many\nof the religious customs, festivals and traditions. And this has a\nsurprising effect in assimilating the opposite character and sharpest\npeculiarities of various races of otherwise distinct and independant\norigin.\n\nThe population of Morocco presents five distant races and classes of\npeople; Berbers, Arabs, Moors, Jews and <DW64>s. Turks are not found in\nMorocco, and do not come so far west; but sons of Turks by Moorish women\nin Kouroglies are included among the Moors, that have emigrated from\nAlgeria. Maroquine Berbers, include the varieties of the Amayeegh [14]\nand the Shelouh, who mostly are located in the mountains, while the\nArabs are settled on the plains.\n\nThe Moors are the inhabitants of towns and cities, consisting of a\nmixture of nearly all races, a great proportion of them being of the\ndescendants of the Moors expelled from Spain. All these races have been,\nand will still be, farther noticed in the progress of the work. The\nproximate amount of this population is six millions. The greater number\nof the towns and cities are situate on the coast, excepting the three or\nfour capitals, or imperial cities. The other towns of the interior\nshould be considered rather as forts to awe neighbouring tribes, or as\nmarket villages (_souks_), where the people collect together for the\ndisposal and exchange of their produce. Numerous tribes, located in the\nAtlas, escape the notice of the imposts of imperial authority. Their\nvarieties and amount of population are equally unknown. In the immense\ngroup of Gibel Thelge (snowy mountains), some of the tribes are said to\nhave their faces shaved, like Christians, and to wear boots. We can\nunderstand why a people inhabiting a cold region of rain and mists and\nperpetual snow should wear boots; but as to their shaving like\nChristians, this is rather vague. But it is not impossible the Atlas\ncontains the descendants of some European refugees.\n\nThe nature of the soil and climate of Morocco are not unlike those of\nSpain and Portugal; and though Morocco does not materially differ from\nother parts of Barbary, its greater extent of coast on the Atlantic,\nalong which the tradewind of the north coast blows nine months out of\ntwelve, and its loftier ridges of the Atlas, so temper its varied\nsurface of hill and plain and vast declivities that, together with the\nabsence of those marshy districts which in hot climates engender fatal\ndisease, this country may be pronounced, excepting perhaps Tunis, the\nmost healthy in all Africa.\n\nIn the northern provinces, the climate is nearly the same as that of\nSpain; in the southern there is less rain and more of the desert heat,\nbut this is compensated for by the greater fertility in the production\nof valuable staple articles of commerce. Nevertheless, Morocco has its\nextremes of heat and cold, like all the North African coast.\n\nThe most striking object of this portion of the crust of the globe, is\nthe vast Atlas chain of mountains [15], which traverses Morocco from\nnorth-east to south-west, whose present ascertained culminating point,\nMiltsin, is upwards of 15,000 feet above the level of the sea, or equal\nto the highest peaks of the Pyrenees. The Maroquine portion of the Atlas\ncontains its highest peaks, which stretch from the east of Tripoli to\nthe Atlantic Ocean, at Santa Cruz; and we find no mountains of equal\nheight, except in the tenth degree of North latitude, or 18,000 miles\nsouth, or 30,000 south, south-east. The Rif coast has a mountainous\nchain of some considerable height, but the Atlantic coast offers chiefly\nridges of hills. The coasts of Morocco are not much indented, and\nconsequently have few ports, and these offer poor protection from the\nocean.\n\nThe general surface of Morocco presents a large ridge or lock, with two\nimmense declivities, one sloping N.W. to the ocean, with various rivers\nand streams descending from this enormous back-bone of the Atlas, and\nthe other fulling towards the Sahara, S.E., feeding the streams and\naffluents of Wad Draha, and other rivers, which are lost in the sands of\nthe Desert. This shape of the country prevents the formation of those\nvast _Sebhahas_, or salt lakes, so frequent in Algeria and the south of\nTunis. We are acquainted only with two lakes of fresh or sweet\nwater--that of Debaia, traversed by Wad Draha,--and that of\nGibel-Akhder, which Leo compares to Lake Bolsena. The height of the\nmountains, and the uniformity of their <DW72>s, produce large and\nnumerous rivers; indeed, the most considerable of all North Africa.\nThese rivers of the North are shortest, but have the largest volume of\nwater; those of the South are larger, but are nearly dry the greater\npart of the year. None of them are navigable far inland. Some abound\nwith fish, particularly the Shebbel, or Barbary salmon. It is neither so\nrich nor so large as our salmon, and is whitefleshed; it tastes\nsomething like herring, but is of a finer and more delicate flavour.\nThey are abundant in the market of Mogudor. The Shebbel, converted by\nthe Spaniards Sabalo, is found in the Guadalquivir.\n\nThe products of the soil are nearly the same as in other parts of\nBarbary. On the plains, or in the open country, the great cultivation is\nwheat and barley; in suburban districts, vegetables and fruits are\npropagated. In a commercial point of view, the North exports cattle,\ngrain, bark, leeches, and skins; and the South exports gums, almonds,\nostrich-feathers, wax, wool, and skins, as principle staple produce.\nWhen the rains cease or fail, the cultivation is kept up by irrigation,\nand an excellent variety of fruits and esculent vegetables are produced;\nindeed, nearly all the vegetables and fruit-trees of Southern Europe are\nhere abundantly and successfully cultivated, besides those peculiar to\nan African clime and soil. In the south, grows a tree peculiar to this\ncountry, the Eloeondenron Argan, so called from its Arabic name Argan.\nThis tree produces fruit resembling the olive, whose egg-shaped, brown,\nsmooth and very hard stone, encloses a flat almond, of a white colour,\nand of a very disagreeable taste, which, when crushed, produces a rancid\noil, used commonly as a substitute for olive-oil. The tree itself is\nbushy and large, and sometimes grows of the size to a wide-spreading\noak. Not far from Mogador are several Argan forests. The level country\nof the north is covered with forests of dwarfish oak; some bear sweet,\nand others bitter acorns, and also the cork-tree, whose bark is a\nconsiderable object of commerce. In the Atlas, has been found the\nmagnificent cedar of Lebanon. This tree has also been met with in\nAlgeria, but only on the mountains, some forty thousand feet above the\nlevel of the sea.\n\nIn the South there is, of course, growing in all its Saharan vigour, the\nnoble date-palm, and by its side, squats the palmetto, or dwarf-palm (in\nArabic _dauma_). Of trees and plants, the usual tinzah, and snouber or\npine of Aleppo, are used for preparing the fine leathers of Morocco.\nMany plants are also deleteriously employed for exciting intoxication,\nor inflaming the passions.\n\nMorocco has its mines of gold, silver, lead, iron, tin, sulphur,\nmineral, salt, and antimony; but nearly all are neglected, or unworked.\nGovernment will not encourage the industry of the people, for fear of\nexciting the cupidity of foreigners. A Frenchman, a short time ago,\nreported a silver mine in the south, and Government immediately bribed\nhim to make another statement that there was no such mine. At Elala and\nStouka, in the province of Sous, are several rich silver mines. Gold is\nfound in the Atlas and the Lower Sous. But this country is especially\nrich in copper mines. A great number of ancient and modern authors speak\nof these mines, which are situate in the mountainous country comprised\nbetween Aghadir, Morocco, Talda, Tamkrout, and Akka. The mines most\nworked, are those of Tedsi and Afran. At the foot of the Atlas, near\nTaroudant, is a great quantity of sulphur. In the neighbourhood of\nMorocco, saltpetre is found. In the province of Abda is an extensive\nsalt lake, and salt has been exported from this country to Timbuctoo. Of\nprecious stones, some fine specimens of amethyst have been discovered.\n\nThere are scarcely any animals peculiar to Morocco, or which are not\nfound in other parts of North Africa. Davidson mentions some curious\nfacts relative to the desert horse; \"_sherb-errech_, wind-bibber, or\ndrinker of the wind,\" a variety of this animal, which is not to be met\nwith in the Saharan regions of Tunis, or Tripoli.\n\nThis horse is fed only on camel's milk, and is principally used for\nhunting ostriches, which are run down by it, and then captured. [16] The\n_sherb-errech_ will continue running three or four days together without\nany food. It is a slight and spare-formed animal, mostly in wretched\ncondition, with ugly thick legs, and devoid of beauty as a horse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nDivision of Morocco into kingdoms or States, and zones or regions.--\nDescription of the towns and cities on the Maroquine coasts of the\nMediterranean and Atlantic waters.--The Zafarine Isles.--Melilla.--\nAlhucemas.--Penon de Velez.--Tegaza.--Provinces of Rif and Garet.--\nTetouan.--Ceuta.--Arzila.--El Araish.--Mehedia.--Salee.--Rabat.--\nFidallah.--Dar-el-Beidah.--Azamour.--Mazagran.--Saffee.--Waladia.\n\n\nMorocco has been divided into States, or kingdoms by Europeans, although\nsuch divisions scarcely exist in the administration of the native\nprinces. The ancient division mentioned by Leo was that of two large\nprovinces of Morocco and Fez, separated by the river Bouragrag, which\nempties itself into the sea between Rabat and Salee; and, indeed, for\nseveral centuries, these districts were separated and governed by\nindependent princes. Tafilett always, and Sous occasionally, were united\nto Morocco, while Fez itself formed a powerful kingdom, extending itself\neastward as far as the gates of Tlemsen.\n\nThe modern division adopted by several authors, is--\n\nNorthern, or the kingdom of Fez. Central, or the kingdom of Morocco.\nEastern, or the Province of Tafilett. Southern, or the province of Sous.\nSome add to this latter, the Province of Draha.\n\nThen, a great number of districts are enumerated as comprehended in\nthese large and general divisions; but the true division of all\nMussulman States is into tribes. There is besides another, which more\napproaches to European government, viz, into kaidats, or jurisdictions.\nThe name of a district is usually that of its chief tribe, and mountains\nare denominated after the tribes that inhabit them. There is, of course,\na natural division, sometimes called a dividing into zones or specific\nregions, which has already been alluded to in enumerating the natural\nresources of Morocco, and which besides corresponds with the present\npolitical divisions.\n\nI. The North of the Atlas: coming first, the Rif, or mountainous region,\nwhich borders the Mediterranean from the river Moulwia to Tangier,\ncomprising the districts of Hashbat west, and Gharet and Aklaia east.\nThen the intermediate zone of plains and hills, which extends from the\nmiddle course of the Moulwia to Tangier on one coast, and to Mogador on\nthe other.\n\nII. The Central Region, or the great chain of the Atlas. The Deren [17]\nof the natives, from the frontiers of Algeria east to Cape Gheer, on the\nsouth-west. This includes the various districts of the Gharb, Temsna,\nBeni Hasan, Shawia, Fez, Todla, Dukala, Shragno, Abda, Haha, Shedma,\nKhamna, Morocco, &c.\n\nIII. South of the Atlas: or quasi-Saharan region, comprising the various\nprovinces and districts of Sous, Sidi Hisham, Wadnoun, Guezoula, Draha\n(Draa), Tafilett, and a large portion of the Sahara, south-east of the\nAtlas.\n\nAs to statistics of population I am inclined fully to admit the\nstatement of Signor Balbi that, the term of African statistics ought to\nbe rejected as absurd. Count Hemo de Graeberg, who was a long time Consul\nat Tangier, and wrote a statistical and geographical account of the\nempire of Morocco, states the number of the inhabitants of the town of\nMazagran to be two thousand. Mr. Elton who resided there several months,\nassured me it does not contain more than one hundred. Another gentleman\nwho dwelt there says, three hundred. This case is a fair sample of the\nstyle in which the statistics of population in Morocco are and have been\ncalculated.\n\nBefore the occupation of Algeria by the French, all the cities were\nvulgarly calculated at double, or treble their amount of population.\nThis has also been the case even in India, where we could obtain, with\ncare, tolerably correct statistics. The prejudices of oriental and\nAfrico-eastern people are wholly set against statistics, or numbering\nthe population. No mother knows the age of her own child. It is\nill-omened, if not an affront, to ask a man how many children he has;\nand to demand the amount of the population of a city, is either\nconstructed as an infringement upon the prerogative of the omnipotent\nCreator, who knows how many people he creates, and how to take care of\nthem, or it is the question of a spy, who is seeking to ascertain the\nstrength or weakness of the country. Europeans can, therefore, rarely\nobtain any correct statistical information in Morocco: all is proximate\nand conjectural. [18] I am anxious, nevertheless, to give some\nparticulars respecting the population, in order that we may really have\na proximate idea of the strength and resources of this important\ncountry. In describing the towns and cities of the various provinces, I\nshall divide them into,\n\n1. Towns and cities of the coast.\n\n2. Capital or royal cities.\n\n3. Other towns and remarkable places in the interior [19].\n\nThe towns and ports, on the Mediterranean, are of considerable interest,\nbut our information is very scanty, except as far as relates to the\n_praesidios_ of Spain, or the well-known and much frequented towns of\nTetuan and Tangier.\n\nNear the mouth of the Malwia (or fifteen miles distant), is the little\ntown of Kalat-el-wad, with a castle in which the Governor resides.\nWhether the river is navigable up to this place, I have not been able to\ndiscover. The water-communication of the interior of North Africa is not\nworth the name. Zaffarinds or Jafarines, are three isles lying off the\nwest of the river Mulweeah, at a short distance, or near its mouth.\nThese belong to Spain, and have recently been additionally fortified,\nbut why, or for what reason, is not so obvious. Opposite to them, there\nis said to be a small town, situate on the mainland. The Spaniards, in\nthe utter feebleness and decadence of their power, have lately dubbed\nsome one or other \"Captain-general of the Spanish possessions, &c. in\nNorth Africa.\"\n\nMelilla or Melilah is a very ancient city, founded by the Carthaginians,\nbuilt near a cape called by the Romans, _Rusadir_ (now Tres-Forcas) the\nname afterwards given to the city, and which it still retains in the\nform of Ras-ed-Dir, (Head of the mountain). This town is the capital of\nthe province of Garet, and is said to contain 3,000 souls. It is situate\namidst a vast tract of fine country, abounding in minerals, and most\ndelicious honey, from which it is pretended the place receives its name.\n\nOn an isle near, and joined to the mainland by a draw-bridge, is the\nSpanish _praesidio_, or convict-settlement called also Melilla,\ncontaining a population of 2,244 according to the Spanish, but Rabbi and\nGraeberg do not give it more than a thousand. At a short distance,\ntowards the east, is an exceedingly spacious bay, of twenty-two miles in\ncircumference, where, they say, a thousand ships of war could be\nanchored in perfect safety, and where the ancient galleys of Venice\ncarried on a lucrative trade with Fez. Within the bay, three miles\ninland, are the ruins of the ancient city of Eazaza, once a celebrated\nplace.\n\nAlhucemos, is another small island and _praesidio_ of the Spaniards,\ncontaining five or six hundred inhabitants; it commands the bay of the\nsame name, and is situate at the mouth of the river Wad Nechor, where\nthere is also the Islet of Ed-Housh. Near the bay, is the ancient\ncapital, Mezemma, now in ruins; it had, however, some commercial\nimportance in the times of Louis XIV., and carried on trade with France.\n\nPenon de Velez is the third _praesidio_-island, a convict settlement of\nthe Spaniards on this coast, and a very strong position, situate\nopposite the mouths of the river Gomera, which disembogues in the\nMediterranean. The garrison contains some nine hundred inhabitants. So\nfar as natural resources are concerned, Penon de Velez is a mere rock,\nand a part of the year is obliged to be supplied with fresh water from\nthe mainland. Immediately opposite to the continent is the city of\nGomera (or Badis), the ancient Parientina, or perhaps the Acra of\nPtolemy, afterwards called Belis, and by the Spaniards, Velez de la\nGomera. The name Gomera, according to J.A. Conde, is derived from the\ncelebrated Arab tribe of the Gomeres, who flourished in Africa and Spain\nuntil the last Moorish kings of Granada. Count Graberg pretends Gomera\nnow contains three thousand inhabitants! whilst other writers, and of\nlater date, represent this ancient city, which has flourished and played\nan important part through many ages, as entirely abandoned, and the\nabode of serpents and hyaenas. Gellis is a small port, six miles east of\nVelez de Gomera.\n\nTegaza is a small town and port, at two miles or less from the sea near\nPescadores Point, inhabited mostly by fishermen, and containing a\nthousand souls.\n\nThe provinces of Rif and Garet, containing these maritime towns are rich\nand highly cultivated, but inhabited by a warlike and semi-barbarous\nrace of Berbers, over whom the Emperor exercises an extremely precarious\nauthority. Among these tribes, Abd-el-Kader sought refuge and support\nwhen he was obliged to retire from Algeria, and, where he defied all the\npower of the Imperial government for several months. Had the Emir\nchosen, he could have remained in Rif till this time; but he determined\nto try his strength with the Sultan in a pitch battle, which should\ndecide his fate.\n\nThe savage Rifians assemble for barter and trade on market-days, which\nare occasions of fierce and incessant quarrels among themselves, when it\nis not unusual for two or three persons to be left dead on the spot.\nShould any unfortunate vessel strike on these coasts, the crew find\nthemselves in the hands of inhuman wreckers. No European traveller has\never visited these provinces, and we may state positively that\njourneying here is more dangerous than in the farthest wastes of the\nSahara. Spanish renegades, however, are found among them, who have\nescaped from the _praesidios_, or penal settlements. The Rif country is\nfull of mines, and is bounded south by one of the lesser chains of the\nAtlas running parallel with the coast. Forests of cork clothe the\nmountain-<DW72>s; the Berbers graze their herds and flocks in the deep\ngreen valleys, and export quantities of skins.\n\nTetuan, the Yagath of the Romans, situate at the opening of the Straits\nof Gibraltar, four or five miles from the sea, upon the declivity of a\nhill and within two small ranges of mountains, is a fine, large, rich\nand mercantile city of the province of Hasbat. It has a resident\ngovernor of considerable power and consequence, the name of the present\nfunctionary being Hash-Hash, who has long held the appointment, and\nenjoys great influence near the Sultan. Half a mile east of the city\npasses from the south Wad Marteen, (the Cus of Marmol) which disembogues\ninto the sea; on its banks is the little port of Marteen or Marteel, not\nquite two miles distant from the coast, and about three from the city,\nwhere a good deal of commerce is carried on, small vessels, laden with\nthe produce of Barbary, sailing thence to Spain, Gibraltar, and even\nFrance and Italy. The population of Tetouan is from nine to twelve\nthousand souls, including, besides Moors and Arabs, four thousand Jews,\ntwo thousand <DW64>s, and eight thousand Berbers. The streets are\ngenerally formed into arcades, or covered bazaars.\n\nThe Jews have a separate quarter; their women are celebrated for their\nbeauty. The suburbs are adorned with fine gardens, and olive and vine\nplantations. Orange groves, or rather orange forests, extend for miles\naround, yielding their golden treasures. A great export of oranges could\nbe established here, which might be conveyed overland to India.\nAltogether, Tetuan is one of the most respectable coast-cities of\nMorocco, though it has no port immediately adjoining it. Its\nfortifications are only strong enough to resist the attack of hostile\nBerbers. The town is about two-thirds of a day's journey from Tangier,\nsouth-east. A fair day's journey would be, in Morocco, upwards of thirty\nEnglish miles, but a good deal depends upon the season of the year when\nyou travel.\n\nCeuta is considered to be Esilissa of Ptolemy, and was once the capital\nof Mauritania Tingitana. The Arabs call it Sebat and Sebta, _i.e._,\n\"seven,\" after the Romans, who called it _Septem fratres_, and the\nGreeks the same, apparently on account of the seven mountains, which are\nin the neighbourhood. Ceuta, or Sebta, is evidently the modern form of\nthis classic name. It is a very ancient city and celebrated fortress,\nsituate fourteen miles south of Gibraltar, nearly opposite to it, as a\nspecies of rival stronghold, and placed upon a peninsula, which detaches\nitself from the continent on the east, and turns then to the north. The\ncity extends over the tongue of land nearest the continent; the citadel\noccupies Monte-del-Acho, called formerly Jibel-el-Mina, a name still\npreserved in Almina, a suburb to the south-east.\n\nIn the beginning of the eighth century, Ceuta, which was inhabited by\nthe Goths, passed into the hands of the Arabs, who made it a point of\ndeparture for the expeditions into Spain. It was conquered by the\npowerful Arab family of the Ben-Hamed, one of whom, called Mohammed\nEdris, invaded Spain, and, after several conquests, was proclaimed King\nof Cordova, in A.D. 1,000,\n\nOn 21st of August, 1415, the Portuguese conquered it, and it was the\nfirst place which they occupied in Africa. In 1578, at the death of Don\nSebastian, Ceuta passed with Portugal and the rest of the colonies into\nthe power of Spain; and when, in 1640, the Portuguese recovered their\nindependence, the Spaniards were left masters of Ceuta, which continues\nstill in their hands, but is of no utility to them except as a\n_praesidio_, which makes the fourth penal settlement possessed by them\non this coast.\n\nCeuta contains a garrison of two or three thousand men. The free\npopulation amounts to some five or six thousand. It has a small and\ninsecure port. Here is the famed Gibel Zaterit, \"Monkey's promontory,\"\nor \"Ape's Hill,\" which has occasioned the ingenious fable, that,\ninasmuch as there are no monkeys in any part of Europe except Gibraltar,\ndirectly opposite to this rock, where also monkeys are found, there must\nnecessarily be a subterranean passage beneath the sea, by which they\npass and re-pass to opposite sides of the Straits, and maintain a\nfriendly and uninterrupted intercourse between the brethren of Africa\nand Europe. Anciently, the mountains hereabouts formed the African\npillars of Hercules opposite to Gibraltar, which may be considered the\nEuropean pillar of that respectable hero of antiquity.\n\nPassing Tangier after a day's journey, we come to Arzila or Asila, in\nthe province of Hasbat, which is an ancient Berber city, and which, when\nconquered by the Romans, was named first Zilia and afterwards Zulia,\n_Constantia Zilis_. It is placed on the naked shores of the Atlantic,\nand has a little port. Whilst possessed by the Portuguese, it was a\nplace of considerable strength, but its fortifications being, as usual,\nneglected by the Moors, are now rapidly decaying. [20] The population is\nabout one thousand. The country around produces good tobacco. The next\ntown on the Atlantic, after another day's journey southwards, is El\nAraish, _i.e._, the trellices of vines; vulgarly called Laratsh. This\ncity replaces the ancient Liscas or Lixus and Lixa, whose ruins are\nnear. The Arabs call it El-Araish Beai-Arous, _i.e._, the vineyards of\nthe Beni-Arous, a powerful tribe, who populate the greater part of the\ndistrict of Azgar, of which it is the capital and the residence of the\nGovernor. It was, probably, built by this tribe about 1,200 or 1,300,\nAD. El-Araish contains a population of 2,700 Moors, and 1,300 Jews, or\n4,000 souls; but others give only 2,000 for the whole amount, of which\n250 are Jews. It has a garrison of 500 troops. The town is situate upon\na small promontory stretching into the sea, and along the mouth of the\nriver Cos, or Luccos (Loukkos), which forms a secure port, but of so\ndifficult access, that vessels of two hundred tons can scarcely enter\nit. In winter, the roadstead is very bad; [21] the houses are\nsubstantially built; and the fortifications are good, because made by\nthe Spaniards, who captured this place in 1610, but it was re-taken by\nMuley Ishmael in 1689. The climate is soft and delicious. In the\nenvirons, cotton is cultivated, and charcoal is made from the Araish\nforest of cork-trees. El-Araish exports cork, wool, skins, bark, beans,\nand grain, and receives in exchange iron, cloth, cottons, muslins, sugar\nand tea. The lions and panthers of the mountains of Beni Arasis\nsometimes descend to the plains to drink, or carry off a supper of a\nsheep or bullock. Azgar, the name of this district, connects it with one\nof the powerful tribes of the Touaricks; and, probably, a section of\nthis tribe of Berbers were resident here at a very early period (at the\nsame time the Berber term _ayghar_ corresponds to the Arabic _bahira_,\nand signifies \"plain.\")\n\nThe ancient Lixus deserves farther mention on account of the interest\nattached to its coins, a few of which remain, although but very recently\ndeciphered by archeologists. There are five classes of them, and all\nPhoenician, although the city now under Roman rule, represents the\nvineyard riches of this part of ancient Mauritania by two bunches of\ngrapes, so that, after nearly three thousand years, the place has\nretained its peculiarity of producing abundant vines, El-Araish, being\n\"the vine trellices;\" others have stamped on them \"two ears of corn\" and\n\"two fishes,\" representing the fields of corn waving on the plains of\nMorocco, and the fish (shebbel especially) which fills its northern\nrivers.\n\nStrabo says:--\"Mauritania generally, excepting a small part desert, is\nrich and fertile, well watered with rivers and washed with lakes;\nabounding in all things, and producing trees of great dimensions.\"\nAnother writer adds \"this country produces a species of the vine whose\ntrunk the extended arms of two men cannot embrace, and which yields\ngrapes of a cubit's length.\" \"At this city,\" says Pliny, \"was the palace\nof Antaeus, and his combat with Hercules and the gardens of Hesperides.\"\n\nMehedia or Mamora, and sometimes, Nuova Mamora, is situate upon the\nnorth-western <DW72> of a great hill, some four feet above the sea, upon\nthe left bank of the mouth of the Sebon, and at the edge of the\ncelebrated plain and forest of Mamora, belonging to the province of\nBeni-Hassan. According to Marmol, Mamora was built by Jakob-el-Mansour\nto defend the embouchure of the river. It was captured by the Spaniards\nin 1614, and retaken by the Moors in 1681. The Corsairs formerly took\nrefuge here. It is now a weak and miserable place, commanded by an old\ncrumbling-down castle. There are five or six hundred fishermen,\noccupying one hundred and fifty cabins, who make a good trade of the\nShebbel salmon; it has a very small garrison. The forest of Mamora,\ncontains about sixty acres of fine trees, among which are some splendid\noaks, all suitable for naval construction.\n\nSalee or Sala, a name which this place bore antecedently to the Roman\noccupation, is a very ancient city, situate upon the right bank of the\nriver Bouragrag, and near its mouth. This place was captured in 1263, by\nAlphonso the Wise, King of Castille, who was a short time after\ndispossessed of his conquest by the King of Fez; and the Moorish Sultans\nhave kept it to the present time, though the city itself has often\nattempted to throw off the imperial yoke. The modern Salee is a large\ncommercial and well-fortified city of the province of Beni-Hassan. Its\nport is sufficiently large, but, on account of the little depth of\nwater, vessels of large burden cannot enter it. The houses and public\nplaces are tolerably well-built. The town is fortified by a battery of\ntwenty-four pieces of cannon fronting the sea, and a redoubt at the\nentrance of the river. What navy the Maroquines have, is still laid up\nhere, but the dock-yard is now nearly deserted, and the few remaining\nships are unserviceable. The population, all of whom are Mahometans, are\nnow, as in Corsair times, the bitterest and most determined enemies of\nChristians, and will not permit a Christian or Jew to reside among them.\nThe amount of this population, and that of Rabat, is thus given,\n\n  _Salee Rabat_\n  Graeberg         23,000    27,000\n  Washington       9,000    21,000\n  Arlett          14,000    24,000\n\nbut it is probably greatly exaggerated.\n\nA resident of this country reduces the population of Salee as low as two\nor three thousand. For many years, the port of Salee was the rendezvous\nof the notorious pirates of Morocco, who, together with the city of\nRabat, formed a species of military republic almost independent of the\nSultan; these Salee rovers were at once the most ferocious and\ncourageous in the world. Time was, when these audacious freebooters lay\nunder Lundy Island in the British Channel, waiting to intercept British\ntraders! \"Salee,\" says Lempriere, \"was a place of good commerce, till,\naddicting itself entirely to piracy, and revolting from the allegiance\nto its Sovereign, Muley Zidan, that prince in the year 1648, dispatched\nan embassy to King Charles 1, of England, requesting him to send a\nsquadron of men-of-war to lie before the town, while he attacked by\nland.\" This request being acceded to, the city was soon reduced, the\nfortifications demolished, and the leaders of the rebellion put to\ndeath. The year following, the Emperor sent another ambassador to\nEngland, with a present of Barbary horses and three hundred Christian\nslaves.\n\nRabat, or Er-Rabat, and on some of the foreign maps Nuova Sale, is a\nmodern city of considerable extent, densely populated, strong and\nwell-built, belonging to the province of Temsna. It is situated on the\ndeclivity of a hill, opposite to Salee, on the other side of the river,\nor left side of the Bouragrag, which is as broad as the Thames at\nLondon Bridge, and might be considered as a great suburb, or another\nquarter of the same city. It was built by the famous Yakob-el-Mansour,\nnephew of Abd-el-Moumen, and named by him Rabat-el-Fatah, _i.e._, \"camp\nof victory,\" by which name it is now often mentioned.\n\nThe walls of Rabat enclose a large space of ground, and the town is\ndefended on the seaside by three forts, erected some years ago by an\nEnglish renegade, and furnished with ordnance from Gibraltar. Among the\npopulation are three or four thousand Jews, some of them of great wealth\nand consequence. The merchants are active and intelligent, carrying on\ncommerce with Fez, and other places of the interior, as also with the\nforeign ports of Genoa, Gibraltar, and Marseilles. In the middle ages,\nthe Genoese had a great trade with Rabat, but this trade is now removed\nto Mogador, Many beautiful gardens and plantations adorn the suburbs,\ndeserving even the name of \"an earthly paradise.\"\n\nThe Moors of Rabat are mostly from Spain, expelled thence by the\nSpaniards. The famous Sultan, Almanzor, intended that Rabat should be\nhis capital. His untenanted mausoleum is placed here, in a separate and\nsacred quarter. This prince, surnamed \"the victorious,\" (Elmansor,) was\nhe who expelled the Moravedi from Spain. He is the Nero of Western\nAfrica, as Keatinge says, their \"King Arthur.\" Tradition has it that\nElmansor went in disguise to Mecca, and returned no more. Mankind love\nthis indefinite and obscure end of their heroes. Moses went up to the\nmountain to die there in eternal mystery. At a short distance from Rabat\nis Shella, or its ruins, a small suburb situated on the summit of a\nhill, which contains the tombs of the royal family of the Beni-Merini,\nand the founder of Rabat, and is a place of inviolate sanctity, no\ninfidel being permitted to enter therein. Monsieur Chenier supposes\nShella to have been the site of the metropolis of the Carthaginian\ncolonies.\n\nOf these two cities, on the banks of the Wad-Bouragrag, Salee was,\naccording to D'Anville, always a place of note as at the present time,\nand the farthest Roman city on the coast of the Atlantic, being the\nfrontier town of the ancient Mauritania Tingitana. Some pretend that all\nthe civilization which has extended itself beyond this point is either\nMoorish, or derived from European colonists. The river Wad-Bouragrag is\nsomewhat a natural line of demarcation, and the products and animals of\nthe one side differ materially from those of the other, owing to the\nnumber and less rapid descent of the streams on the side of the north,\nand so producing more humidity, whilst the south side, on the contrary,\nis of a higher and drier soil.\n\nFidallah, or Seid Allah, _i. e_., \"grace,\" or \"gift of God,\" is a\nmaritime village of the province of Temsa, founded by the Sultan\nMohammed in 1773. It is a strong place, and surrounded with walls.\nFidallah is situated on a vast plain, near the river Wad Millah, where\nthere is a small port, or roadstead, to which the corsairs were wont to\nresort when they could not reach Salee, long before the village was\nbuilt, called Mersa Fidallah. The place contains a thousand souls,\nmostly in a wretched condition. Sidi Mohammed, before he built Mogador,\nhad the idea of building a city here; the situation is indeed\ndelightful, surrounded with fertility.\n\nDar-el-Beida (or Casa-Blanco, \"white house,\") is a small town, formerly\nin possession of the Portuguese, who built it upon the ruins of Anfa or\nAnafa, [22] which they destroyed in 1468. They, however, scarcely\nfinished it when they abandoned it in 1515. Dar-el-Beida is situate on\nthe borders of the fertile plains of the province of Shawiya, and has a\nsmall port, formed by a river and a spacious bay on the Atlantic. The\nRomans are said to have built the ancient Anafa, in whose time it was a\nconsiderable place, but now it scarcely contains above a thousand\ninhabitants, and some reduce them to two hundred. Sidi Mohammed\nattempted this place, and the present Sultan endeavoured to follow up\nthese efforts. A little commerce with Europe is carried on here. The bay\nwill admit of vessels of large burden anchoring in safety, except when\nthe wind blows strong from the north-west. Casa Blanco is two days\njourney from Rabat, and two from Azamor, or Azemmour, which is an\nancient and fine city of the province of Dukaila, built by the Amazigh\nBerbers, in whose language it signifies \"olives.\" It is situate upon a\nhill, about one hundred feet above the sea, and distant half a mile from\nthe shore, not far from the mouth of the Wad-Omm-er-Rbia (or Omm-Erbegh)\non its southern bank, and is everywhere surrounded by a most fertile\nsoil. Azamor contains now about eight or nine hundred inhabitants, but\nformerly was much more populated. The Shebbel salmon is the principal\ncommerce, and a source of immense profit to the town. The river is very\ndeep and rapid, so that the passage with boats is both difficult and\ndangerous. It is frequently of a red colour, and charged with slime like\nthe Nile at the period of its inundations. The tide is felt five or six\nleagues up the river, according to Chenier. Formerly, vessels of every\nsize entered the river, but now its mouth has a most difficult bar of\nsand, preventing large vessels going up, like nearly all the Maroquine\nports situate on the mouths, or within the rivers.\n\nAzamor was taken by the Portuguese under the command of the Duke of\nBraganza in 1513 who strengthened it by fortifications, the walls of\nwhich are still standing; but it was abandoned a century afterwards, the\nIndies having opened a more lucrative field of enterprise than these\nbarren though honourable conquests on the Maroquine coast. This place is\nhalf a day's journey, or about fourteen miles from Mazagran, _i. e_. the\nabove Amayeeghs, an extremely ancient and strong castle, erected on a\npeninsula at the bottom of a spacious and excellent bay. It was rebuilt\nby the Portuguese in 1506, who gave it the name of Castillo Real. The\nsite has been a centre of population from the remotest period, chiefly\nBerbers, whose name it still bears. The Arabs, however, call it\nEl-Bureeja, i.e., \"the citadel.\" The Portuguese abandoned it in 1769;\nMazagran was the last stronghold which they possessed in Morocco. The\ntown is well constructed, and has a wall twelve feet thick, strengthened\nwith bastions. There is a small port, or dock, on the north side of the\ntown, capable of admitting small vessels, and the roadstead is good,\nwhere large vessels can anchor about two miles off the shore. Its\ntraffic is principally with Rabat, but there is also some export trade\nto foreign parts. Its population is two or three hundred. [23] After\nproceeding two days south-west, you arrive at Saffee, or properly\nAsafee, called by the natives Asfee, and anciently Soffia or Saffia, is\na city of great antiquity, belonging to the province of Abda, and was\nbuilt by the Carthaginians near Cape Pantin. Its site lies between two\nhills, in a valley which is exposed to frequent inundations. The\nroadstead of Saffee is good and safe during summer, and its shipping\nonce enabled it to be the centre of European commerce on the Atlantic\ncoast. The population amounts to about one thousand, including a number\nof miserable Jews. The walls of Saffee are massy and high. The\nPortuguese captured this city in 1508, voluntarily abandoning it in\n1641. The country around is not much cultivated, and presents melancholy\ndeserts; but there is still a quantity of corn grown. About forty miles\ndistant, S.E., is a large salt lake. Saffee is one and a half day's\njourney from Mogador.\n\nEquidistant between Mazagran and Saffee is the small town of El-Waladia,\nsituate on an extensive plain. Persons report that near this spot is a\nspacious harbour, or lagune, sufficiently capacious to contain four or\nfive hundred sail of the line; but, unfortunately, the entrance is\nobstructed by some rocks, which, however, it is added, might easily be\nblown up. The lagune is also exposed to winds direct for the ocean. The\ntown, enclosed within a square wall, and containing very few\ninhabitants, is supposed to have been built in the middle of the\nseventeenth century by the Sultan Waleed. after whom it was named.\n\nThis brings us to Mogador, which, with Aghadir, have already been\ndescribed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nDescription of the Imperial Cities or Capitals of the Empire.--\nEl-Kesar.--Mequinez.--Fez.--Morocco.--The province of Tafilett, the\nbirth-place of the present dynasty of the Shereefs.\n\n\nThe royal or capitals of the interior now demand our attention, which\nare El-Kesar, Mequinez, Fez, and Morocco.\n\nEl-Kesar, or Al-Kesar, [24] styled also El-Kesue-Kesar, is so named and\ndistinguished because it owes its enlargement to the famous Sultan of\nFez, Almansor, who improved and beautified it about the year 1180, and\ndesigned this city as a magazine and rendezvous of troops for the great\npreparations he was making at the time for the conquest of Granada.\nEl-Kesar is in the province of the Gharb, and situate on the southern\nbank of the Luccos; here is a deep and rapid stream, flowing W. 1/4 N.W.\nThe town is nearly as large as Tetuan, but the streets are dirty and\nnarrow, and many of the houses in a ruinous condition, This fortified\nplace was once adorned by some fifteen mosques, but only two or three\nare now fit for service. The population does not exceed four or five\nthousand souls, and some think this number over-estimated.\n\nThe surrounding country is flat meadowland, but flooded after the rains,\nand producing fatal fevers, though dry and hot enough in summer. The\nsuburban fields are covered with gardens and orchards. It was at\nEl-Kesar, where, in A.D. 1578, the great battle of The Three Kings came\noff, because, besides the Portuguese King, Don Sebastian, two Moorish\nprinces perished on this fatal day. But one of them, Muley Moluc, died\nvery ill in a litter, and was not killed in the fight; his death,\nhowever, was kept a secret till the close of the battle, in order that\nthe Moors might not be discouraged. With their prince, Don Sebastian,\nperished the flower of the Portuguese nobility and chivalry of that\ntime. War, indeed, was found \"a dangerous game\" on that woeful day: both\nfor princes and nobles, and many a poor soul was swept away\n\n  \"Floating in a purple tide.\"\n\nBut the \"trade of war\" has been carried on ever since, and these\nlessons, written in blood, are as useless to mankind as those dashed off\nby the harmless pen of the sentimental moralist. El-Kesar is placed in\nLatitude, 35 deg. 1 10\" N.; Longitude, 5 deg. 49' 30\" W.\n\nMequinez, [25] in Arabic, Miknas (or Miknasa), is a royal residence, and\ncity of the province of Fez, situate upon a hill in the midst of a\nwell-watered and most pleasant town, blessed with a pure and serene air.\nThe city of Miknas is both large and finely built, of considerable\ninterest and of great antiquity. It was founded by the tribe of Berbers\nMeknasab, a fraction of the Zenatah, in the middle of the tenth century,\nand called Miknasat, hence is derived its present name. The modern town\nis surrounded with a triple wall thirteen feet high and three thick,\nenclosing a spacious area. This wall is mounted with batteries to awe\nthe Berbers of the neighbouring mountains. The population amounts to\nabout twenty thousand souls, (some say forty or fifty thousand) in which\nare included about nine thousand <DW64> troops, constituting the greater\nportion of the Imperial guard. Two thousand of these black troops are in\ncharge of the royal treasures, estimated at some fifty millions of\ndollars, and always increasing. These treasures consist of jewels, bars\nof gold and silver, and money in the two precious metals, the greater\npart being Spanish and Mexican dollars.\n\nThe inhabitants are represented as being the most polished of the Moors,\nkind and hospitable to strangers. The palace of the Emperor is extremely\nsimple and elegant, all the walls of which are _embroidered_ with the\nbeautiful stucco-work of Arabesque patterns, as pure and chaste as the\nfinest lace. The marble for the pillars was furnished from the ruins\nadjacent, called Kesar Faraoun, \"Castle of Pharoah\" (a name given to\nmost of the old ruins of Morocco, of whose origin there is any doubt).\n\nDuring the times of piracy, there was here, as also at Morocco, a\nSpanish hospitium for the ransom and recovery of Christian slaves. Even\nbefore Mequinez was constituted a royal city, it was a place of\nconsiderable trade and riches. Nothing of any peculiar value has been\ndiscovered among the extensive and ancient ruins about a mile distant,\nand which have furnished materials for the building of several royal\ncities; they are, however, supposed to be Roman. Scarcely a day's\njourney separates Mequinez from Fez. It is not usual for two royal\ncities to be placed so near together, but which must render their\nfortunes inseparable.\n\nFez, or Fas. According to some, the name Fas, which signifies in Arabia\na pickaxe, was given to it because one was found in digging its\nfoundations. Others derive it from Fetha, silver. It is no longer the\nmarvellous city described by Leo Africanus, yet its learning, wealth,\nand industry place it in the first rank of the cities of Morocco. During\nthe eighth century, the Arabs, masters of Tunis, of all Algeria, and the\nmaritime cities of Morocco, seemed to think only of invading Europe and\nconsolidating their power in Spain; but at this epoch, a descendant of\nAli and Fatima, Edris Ben Abdalluh, quitted Arabia, passed into Morocco,\nand established himself at Oualili, the capital, where he remained till\nhis death, and where he was buried. His character was generally known\nand venerated for its sanctity, and drew upon him the affectionate\nregard of the people, and all instinctively placed themselves near him\nas a leader of the Faithful, likely to put an end to anarchy, and\nestablish order in the Mussulman world. His son, Edris-Ben-Edris, who\ninherited his virtues and influence, offering a species of ancient\nprototype to Abd-el Kader and his venerable father, Mahadin, was the\nfirst _bona-fide_ Mussulman sovereign of the Maroquine empire, and\nfounded Fez.\n\nFez is a most ancient centre of population, and had long been a famed\ncity, before Muley Edris, in the year A.D. 807 (others in 793), gave it\nits present form and character.\n\nFrom that period, however, Fez [26] dates its modern celebrity and rank\namong the Mahometan capitals of the world, and especially as being the\nsecond city of Islamism, and the \"palace of the Mussulmen Princes of the\nWest.\" That the Spanish philologists should make Fut, of the Prophet\nNahum, to be the ancient capital of Fez, is not remarkable, considering\nthe numerous bands of emigrants, who, emerging from the coast, wandered\nas far as the pillars of Hercules; and, besides, in a country like North\nAfrica, the theatre of so many revolutions, almost every noted city of\nthe present period has had its ancient form, from which it has been\nsuccessively changed.\n\nThe modern capital is placed in a valley upon the gentle <DW72> of\nseveral hills by which it is surrounded, and whose heights are crowned\nwith lovely gardens breathing odoriferous sweets. Close by is a little\nriver, or a branch of the Tebou, named Wad-el-Juhor, or \"streamlet,\"\nwhich supplies the city with excellent water.\n\nThe present buildings are divided into old and new Fez. The streets are\nso narrow that two men on horseback could scarcely ride abreast; they\nare, besides, very dark, and often arched over. Colonel Scott represents\nsome of the streets, however, as a mile in length. The houses are high,\nbut not handsome. The shops are numerous and much frequented, though not\nvery fine in appearance. Fez contains no less than seven hundred\nmosques, fifty of which are superb, and ornamented with fine columns of\nmarble; there is, besides, a hundred or more of very small and ill-built\nmosques, or rather, houses of prayer. The most famous of these temples\nof worship is El-Karoubin (or El-Karouiin), supported by three hundred\npillars. In this is preserved the celebrated library of antiquity,\nwhere, it is pretended, ancient Greek and Latin authors are to be found\nin abundance with the lost books of Titus Livy.\n\nThis appears to be mere conjecture. [27] But the mosque the more\nfrequented and venerated, is that dedicated to the founder of the city,\nMuley Edris, whose ashes repose within its sacred enclosure. So\nexcessive is this \"hero-worship\" for this great sultan, that the people\nconstantly invoke his name in their prayers instead of that of the\nDeity. The mausoleum of this sacro-santo prince is inviolable and\nunapproachable. The university of Fez was formally much celebrated, but\nlittle of its learning now remains. Its once high-minded orthodox mulahs\nare now succeeded by a fanatic and ignorant race of marabouts.\nNevertheless, the few _hommes de lettres_ found in Morocco are\ncongregated here, and the literature of the empire is concentrated in\nthis city. Seven large public schools are in full activity, besides\nnumbers of private seminaries of instruction. The low humour of the\ntalebs, and the fanaticism of the people, are unitedly preserved and\ndeveloped in this notorious doggerel couplet, universally diffused\nthroughout Morocco:--\n\n  _Ensara fee Senara\n  Elhoud fee Sefoud_\n\n  \"Christians on the hook\n  Jews on the spit,\" or\n\n  \"Let Christians be hooked,\n  And let Jews be cooked.\"\n\nThe great division of the Arabic into eastern and western dialects makes\nlittle real difference in a practical point of view. The Mogrebbin, or\nwestern, is well understood by all travellers, and, of course, by all\nscholars from the East.\n\nThe palace of the Sultan is not large, but is handsome. There are\nnumerous baths, and an hospital for the mad or incurable. The population\nwas estimated, not long ago, at 88,000 souls, of which there were 60,000\nMoors and Arabs (the Moors being chiefly immigrants from Spain), 10,000\nBerbers, 8,000 Jews, and 10,000 <DW64>s. But this amount has been\nreduced to 40,000, or even 30,000; and the probability is, the present\npopulation of Fez does not by any means, exceed 50,000, if it reaches\nthat number. Nearly all the Jews reside in the new city, which, by its\nposition, dominates the old one. The inhabitants of Fez, in spite of\ntheir learning and commerce, are distinguished for their fanaticism; and\nan European, without an escort of troops, cannot walk in the streets\nunless disguised. It was lately the head-quarters of the fanatics who\npreached \"the holy war,\" and involved the Emperor in hostilities with\nthe French.\n\nThe immense trade of every kind carried on at Fez gives it almost the\nair of an European city. In the great square, called Al-Kaisseriah, is\nexhibited all the commerce of Europe and Africa--nay, even of the whole\nworld. The crowd of traffickers here assemble every day as at a fair.\nFez has two annual caravans; one leaves for Central Africa, or\nTimbuctoo; and another for Mecca, or the caravan of pilgrims. The two\ngreat stations and rendezvous points of the African caravan are Tafilett\nand Touat. The journey from Fez to Timbuctoo occupies about ninety days.\nThe Mecca caravan proceeds the same route as far as Touat, and then\nturns bank north-east to Ghadames, Fezzan, and Angelah, and thence to\nAlexandria, which it accomplishes in four or five, to six months. All\ndepends on the inclination of the Shereef, or Commandant, of the\ncaravan; but the journey from Fez to Alexandria cannot, by the quickest\ncaravan, be accomplished in much less time than three months and a half,\nor one hundred days. The value of the investments in this caravan has\nbeen estimated at a million of dollars; for the faithful followers of\nthe Prophet believe, with us, that godliness is profitable in the life\nthat now is, as well as in that which is to come.\n\nFez is surrounded with a vast wall, but which is in decay. What is this\ndecay! It applies almost to every Moorish city and public building in\nNorth Africa. And yet the faith of the false prophet is as strong as\never, and with time and hoary age seems to strike its roots deeper into\nthe hearts of its simple, but enthusiastic and duped devotees!\n\nThe city has seven gates, and two castles, at the east and west, form\nits main defence. These castles are very ancient, and are formed and\nsupported by square walls about sixty feet in front, Ali Bey says,\nsubterraneous passages are reported to exist between these castles and\nthe city; and, whenever the people revolt against the Sultan, cannon are\nplanted on the castles with a few soldiers as their guard. The\nfortifications, or Bastiles, of Paris, we see, therefore, were no new\ninvention of Louis Philippe to awe the populace. The maxims of a subtle\npolicy are instructive in despotism of every description.\n\nThe constituted authorities of Fez are like those of every city of\nMorocco. The Governor is the lieutenant of the sovereign, exercising the\nexecutive power; the Kady, or supreme judge, is charged with the\nadministration of the law, and the Al-Motassen fixes the price of\nprovisions, and decides all the questions of trade and customs. There\nare but few troops at Fez, for it is not a strong military possession;\non the contrary, it is commanded by accessible heights and is exposed to\na _coup-de-main_.\n\nFez, indeed, could make no _bona-fide_ resistance to an European army.\nThe manufactures are principally woollen haiks, silk handkerchiefs,\nslippers and shoes of excellent leather, and red caps of felt, commonly\ncalled the fez; the first fabrication of these red caps appears to have\nbeen in this city. The Spanish Moorish immigrants introduced the mode of\ndressing goat and sheep-skins, at first known by the name of Cordovan\nfrom Cordova; but, since the Moorish forced immigration, they have\nacquired the celebrated name of Morocco. The chief food of the people is\nthe national Moorish dish of _cuscasou_, a fine grained paste, cooked by\nsteam, with melted fat, oil, or other liquids poured upon the dish, and\nsometimes garnished with pieces of fowl and other meat. A good deal of\nanimal food is consumed, but few vegetables. The climate is mild in the\nwinter, but suffocating with heat in the summer. This city is placed in\nlatittude 34 deg. 6' 3\" N. longitude 4 deg. 38\" 15'W.\n\nMorocco, or strictly in Arabic, _Maraksh_, which signifies \"adorned,\"\nis the capital of the South, and frequently denominated the capital of\nthe Empire, but it is only a _triste_ shadow of its former greatness. It\nis sometimes honoured with the title of \"the great city,\" or \"country.\"\nMorocco occupies an immense area of ground, being seven miles in\ncircumference, the interior of which is covered with heaps of ruins or\nmore pleasantly converted into gardens. Morocco was built in 1072 or\n1073 by the famous Yousel-Ben-Tashfin, King of Samtuna, and of the\ndynasty of the Almoravedi, or Marabouts. Its site is that of an ancient\ncity, Martok, founded in the remotest periods of the primitive Africans,\nor aboriginal Berbers, in whose language it signifies a place where\neverything good and pleasant was to be found in abundance.\n\nBocanum Hermerum of the Ancients was also near the site of this capital,\nMorocco attained its greatest prosperity shortly after its foundation,\nand since then it has only declined. In the twelfth century, under the\nreign of Jakoub Almanzor, there were 10,000 houses and 700,000 souls,\n(if indeed we can trust their statistics); but, at the present time,\nthere are only some forty to fifty thousand inhabitants, including 4,000\nShelouhs and 5,000 Jews. Ali Bey, in 1804, estimates its population at\nonly 30,000, and Captain Washington in 1830 at 80, or 100,000. This vast\ncity lies at the foot of the Atlas, or about fourteen miles distant,\nspread over a wide and most lovely plain of the province of Rhamma,\nwatered by the river Tensift, six miles from the gates of the capital.\n\nThe mosques are numerous and rich, the principal of which are\nEl-Kirtubeeah, of elegant architecture with an extremely lofty minaret;\nEl-Maazin, which is three hundred years old, and a magnificent building;\nand Benious, built nearly seven hundred years ago of singular\nconstruction, uniting modern and ancient architecture. The mosque of the\npatron saint is Sidi Belabbess. Nine gates open in the city-walls; these\nare strong and high, and flanked with towers, except on the south east\nwhere the Sultan's palace stands. The streets are crooked, of uneven\nwidth, unpaved, and dirty in winter, and full of dust in summer.\n\nThere are several public squares and marketplaces. The Kaessaria, or\ncommercial quarter, is extensive, exhibiting every species of\nmanufacture and natural product.\n\nThe manufactures of this, as of other large places, are principally,\nsilks, embroidery, and leather. The merchants of Mogador have magazines\nhere; this capital has also its caravans, which trade to the interior,\npassing through Wadnoun to the south.\n\nThe Imperial palace is without the city and fortified with strong walls.\nThere are large gardens attached, in one of which the Emperor receives\nhis merchants and the diplomatic agents. The air of the country, at the\nfoot of the Atlas, is pure and salubrious. The city is well supplied\nwith water from an aqueduct, connecting it with the river Tensift, which\nflows from the gorges of the Atlas. But the inhabitants, although they\nenjoy this inestimable blessing in an African climate, are not famous\nfor their cleanliness; Morocco, if possessing any particular character,\nstill must be considered as a commercial city, for its learning is at a\nvery low ebb. Its interior wears a deeply dejected, nay a profoundly\ngloomy aspect.\n\n  \"Horrendum incultumque specus.\"\n\nand the European merchants, when they come up here are glad to get away\nas soon as possible.\n\nOutside the city, there is a suburb appropriated to lepers, a\nLazar-house of leprosy, which afflicting and loathsome disease descends\nfrom father to son through unbroken generations; the afflicted cannot\nenter the city, and no one dare approach their habitations. The Emperor\nusually resides for a third portion of his time at Morocco the rest at\nFez and Mequinez. Whenever his Imperial Highness has anything\ndisagreeable with foreign European powers, he comes down from Fez to\nMorocco, to get out of the way. Occasionally, he travels from town to\ntown of the interior, to awe by his presence the ever restless\ndisaflfection of the tribes, or excite their loyalty for the Shereefian\nthrone.\n\nMorocco is placed in Lat. 31 deg. 37\" 31' N. and Long. 7 deg. 35\" 30', W.\n\nTafilett consists of a group of towns or villages, situate on the\nsouth-eastern side of the Atlas, which may he added to the royal cities,\nbeing inhabited in part by the Imperial family, and is the birth-place\nof their sovereign power--emphatically called Beladesh-Sherfa, \"country\nof the Shereefs.\" The country was anciently called Sedjelmasa, and\nretained this name up to 1530 A.D., when the principal city acquired the\napellation of Tafilett, said to be derived from an Arab immigrant,\ncalled Filal, who improved the culture of dates, and whose name on this\naccount, under the Berber form of Tafilett, was given to a plantation of\ndates cultivated by him, and then passed to the surrounding districts.\n\nAt the present time, Tafilett consists of a group of fortified or\ncastle-built villages, environed by walls mounted with square towers,\nwhich extend on both sides of the river Zig. There is also a castle, or\nrather small town, upon the left side of the river, called by the\nordinary name of Kesar, which is in the hands of the Shereefs, and\ninhabited entirely by the family of the Prophet. The principal and most\nflourishing place was a long time called Tafilett, but is now according\nto Callie, Ghourlan, and the residence of the Governor of the province\nof Ressant, a town distinguished by a magnificent gateway surrounded\nwith various  Dutch tiles, symmetrically arranged in a diamond\npattern. This traveller calls the district of Tafilett, Afile or Afilel.\n\nIt is probable that from the rains of the ancient Sedjelmasa, some of\nthe modern villages have been constructed. The towns and districts of\nTafilett once formed an independent kingdom. The present population has\nbeen estimated at some ten thousand, but this is entirely conjectural.\nCallie mentions the four towns of Ghourlan, L'Eksebi, Sosso and Boheim\nas containing eleven or twelve thousand souls. The soil of Tafilett is\nlevel, composed of sand of an ashy grey, productive of corn, and all\nsorts of European fruits and vegetables. The natives have fine sheep,\nwith remarkably white wool. The manufactures, which are in woollen and\nsilk, are called Tafiletes.\n\nBesides being a rendezvous of caravans, radiating through all parts of\nthe Sahara, Tafilett is a great mart of traffic in the natural products\nof the surrounding countries. A fine bridge spans the Zig, built by a\nSpaniard. When the Sultan of Morocco finds any portion of his family\ninclined to be naughty, he sends them to Tafilett, as we are wont to\nsend troublesome people to \"Jericho.\" This, at any rate, is better than\ncutting off their heads, which, from time immemorial, has been the\ninvariable practice of African and Oriental despots. The Maroquine\nprinces may be thankful they have Tafilett as a place of exile. The\nEmperors never visit Tafilett except as dethroned exiles. A journey to\nsuch a place is always attended with danger; and were the Sultan to\nescape, he would find, on his return, the whole country in revolt.\n\nRegarding these royal cities, we sum up our observations. The destinies\nof Fez and Mequinez are inseparable. United, they contain one hundred\nthousand inhabitants, the most polished and learned in the Empire. Fez\nis the city of arts and learning, that is of what remains of the once\nfamous and profound Moorish doctors of Spain. Mequinez is the strong\nplace of the Empire, an emporium of arms and imperial Cretsures. Fez is\nthe rival of Morocco. The two cities are the capitals of two kingdoms,\nnever yet amalgamated. The present dynasty belongs not to Fez, but to\nMorocco; though a dynasty of Shereefs, they are Shereefs of the south,\nand African blood flows in their veins.\n\nThe Sultan generally is obliged to give a preference to Fez for a\nresidence, because his presence is necessary to maintain the allegiance\nof the north country, and to curb its powerful warparty, his son in the\nmeanwhile being left Governor during his absence. But all these royal\ncities are on the decline, the \"sere and yellow leaf\" of a well nigh\ndefunct civilization. Morocco is a huge shell of its former greatness, a\nmonster of Moresque dilapidations. France may awaken the slumbering\nenergies of the population of these once flourishing and august cities,\nbut left to themselves they are powerless, sinking under their own\nweight and uncouth encumbrances, and will rise no more till\nreconstructed by European hands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nDescription of the towns and cities of the Interior, and those of the\nKingdom of Fez.--Seisouan.--Wazen.--Zawiat.--Muley Dris.--Sofru.--\nDubdu.--Taza.--Oushdah.--Agla.--Nakbila.--Meshra.--Khaluf.--The Places\ndistinguished in.

The town is\nsmall, but full of artizans and merchants. The country around is\nfertile, being well irrigated with streams. Sousan is the most\nbeautifully picturesque of all the Atlas range.\n\nSofou, or Sofron, is a fine walled city, southeast of Fez, situate upon\nthe river Guizo; in a vast and well-watered plain near, are rich mines\nof fossil salt.\n\nWazen, or Wazein, in the province of Azgar, and the region of the Gharb,\nis a small city without Walls, celebrated for being the residence of\nthe High Priest, or Grand Marabout of the Empire. This title is\nhereditary, and is now (or up to lately) possessed by the famous\nSidi-el-Haj-el-Araby-Ben-Ali, who, in his district, lives in a state of\nnearly absolute independence, besides exercising great influence over\npublic affairs. This saint, or priest, has, however, a rival at Tedda.\nThe two popes together pretend to decide the fate of the Empire. The\ndistricts where these Grand Marabouts reside, are without governors,\nand the inhabitants pay no tribute into the imperial coffers, they are\nruled by their two priests under a species of theocracy. The Emperor\nnever attempts or dares to contest their privileges. Occasionally they\nappear abroad, exciting the people, and declaiming against the vices of\nthe times. His Moorish Majesty then feels himself ill at ease, until\nthey retire to their sanctuaries, and employs all his arts to effect\nthe object, protesting that he will be wholly guided by their councils\nin the future administration of the Empire. With this humiliation of\nthe Shereefs, they are satisfied, and kennel themselves into their\nsanctum-sanctorums.\n\nZawiat-Muley-Driss, which means, retirement of our master, Lord Edris\n(Enoch) and sometimes called Muley Edris, is a far famed city of the\nprovince of Fez, and placed at the foot of the lofty mountains of\nTerhoun, about twenty-eight miles from Fez, north-west, amidst a most\nbeautiful country, producing all the necessaries and luxuries of human\nlife. The site anciently called Tuilet, was perhaps also the Volubilis\nof the ancients. Here is a sanctuary dedicated to the memory of Edris,\nprogenitor and founder of the dynasty of Edrisiti.\n\nThe population, given by Graeberg, is nine thousand, but this is\nevidently exaggerated. Not far off, towards the west, are some\nmagnificent ruins of an ancient city, called Kesar Faraoun, or \"Castle\nof Pharoah.\"\n\nDubdu, called also Doubouton, is an ancient, large city, of the district\nof Shaous, and once the residence of an independent prince, but now\nfallen into decay on account of the sterility of its site, which is upon\nthe sides of a barren mountain. Dubdu is three days' journey southeast\nof Fez, and one day from Taza, in the region of the Mulweeah. Taza is\nthe capital of the well-watered district of Haiaina, and one of the\nfinest cities in Morocco, in a most romantic situation, placed on a rock\nwhich is shaped like an island, and in presence of the lofty mountains\nof Zibel Medghara, to the south-west. Perhaps it is the Babba of the\nancients; a river runs round the town. The houses and streets are\nspacious, and there is a large mosque. The air is pure, and provisions\nare excellent. The population is estimated at ten or twelve thousand,\nwho are hospitable, and carry on a good deal of commerce with Tlemsen\nand Fez. Taza is two days from Fez, and four from Oushda.\n\nOushda is the well-known frontier town, on the north-east, which\nacquired some celebrity during the late war. It is enclosed by the walls\nof its gardens, and is protected by a large fortress. The place contains\na population of from six hundred to one thousand Moors and Arabs. There\nis a mosque, as well as three chapels, dedicated to Santous. The houses,\nbuilt of clay, are low and of a wretched appearance; the streets are\nwinding, and covered with flints. The fortress, where the Kaed resides,\nis guarded in ordinary times by a dozen soldiers; but, were this force\nincreased, it could not be defended, in consequence of its dilapidated\ncondition. A spring of excellent water, at a little distance from\nOushda, keeps up the whole year round freshness and verdure in the\ngardens, by means of irrigation. Cattle hereabouts is of fine quality.\nOushda is a species of oasis of the Desert of Angad, and the aridity of\nthe surrounding country makes these gardens appear delicious, melons,\nolives, and figs being produced in abundance.\n\nThe distance between Tlemsen and Oushda is sixteen leagues, or about\nsixteen hours' march for troops; Oushda is also four or five days from\nOran, and six days from Fez. The Desert commences beyond the Mulweeah,\nat more than forty leagues from Tlemsen. Like the Algerian Angad, which\nextends to the south of Tlemsen, it is of frightful sterility,\nparticularly in summer. In this season, one may march for six or eight\nhours without finding any water. It is impossible to carry on military\noperations in such a country during summer. On this account, Marshal\nBugeaud soon excavated Oushda and returned to the Tlemsen territory.\n\nAghla is a town, or rather large village, of the district of Fez, where\nthe late Muley Suleiman occasionally resided. It is situated along the\nriver Wad Vergha, in a spacious and well-cultivated district. A great\nmarket of cattle, wool, and bees'-wax, is held in the neighbourhood. The\ncountry abounds in lions; but, it is pretended, of such a cowardly race,\nthat a child can frighten them away. Hence the proverb addressed to a\npusillanimous individual, \"You are as brave as the lions of Aghla, whose\ntails the calves eat.\" The Arabs certainly do occasionally run after\nlions with sticks, or throw stones at them, as we are accustomed to\nthrow stones at dogs.\n\nNakhila, _i.e._, \"little palm,\" is a little town of the province of\nTemsna, placed in the river Gueer; very ancient, and formerly rich and\nthickly populated. A great mart, or souk, is annually held at this\nplace. It is the site of the ancient Occath.\n\nMeshru Khaluf, _i.e._, \"ford, or watering-place of the wild-boar,\" in\nthe district of the Beni-Miskeen, is a populated village, and situated\non the right bank of the Ovad Omm-Erbergh, lying on the route of many of\nthe chief cities. Here is the ford of Meshra Khaluf, forty-five feet\nwide, from which the village derives its name.\n\nOn the map will be seen many places called Souk. The interior tribes\nresort thither to purchase and exchange commodities. The market-places\nform groups of villages. It is not a part of my plan to give any\nparticular description of them.\n\nSecond, those places distinguished in the kingdom of Morocco, including\nSous, Draha, and Tafilett.\n\nTefza, a Berber name, which, according to some, signifies \"sand,\" and to\nothers, \"a bundle of straw,\" is the capital of the province of Todla,\nbuilt by the aborigines on the <DW72> of the Atlas, who surrounded it\nwith a high wall of sandstone (called, also, Tefza.) At two miles east\nof this is the smaller town of Efza, which is a species of suburb,\ndivided from Tefza by the river Derna. The latter place is inhabited\ncertainly by Berbers, whose women are famous for their woollen works and\nweaving. Tefza is also celebrated for its native black and white woollen\nmanufactures. The population of the two places is stated at upwards of\n10,000, including 2,000 Jews.\n\nPitideb, or Sitideb, is another fine town in the neighbourhood, built by\nthe Amazirghs on the top of a high mountain. The inhabitants are\nesteemed the most civilized of their nation, and governed by their own\nelders and chiefs, they live in a state of almost republican\nindependence. Some good native manufactures are produced, and a large\ncommerce with strangers is carried on. The women are reputed as being\nextremely fair and fascinating.\n\nGhuer, or Gheu, (War, _i.e._, \"difficult?\") is a citadel, or rather a\nstrong, massive rock, and the most inaccessible of all in Morocco,\nforming a portion of the mountains of Jedla, near the sources of the Wad\nOmm-Erbegh. This rocky fort is the residence of the supreme Amrgar, or\nchief of the Amazirghs, who rendered himself renowned through the empire\nby fighting a pitch-battle with the Imperial troops in 1819. Such chiefs\nand tribes occasion the weakness of the interior; for, whenever the\nSultan has been embroiled with European Powers, these aboriginal\nAmazirghs invariably seized the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and\nancient grudges. The Shereefs always compound with them, if they can,\nthese primitive tribes being so many centres of an _imperium imperio_,\nor of revolt and disaffection.\n\nTijijet in the province of Dukkalah, situate on the left bank of the\nriver Omm-Erbegh, along the route from Fez to Morocco, is a small town,\nbut was formerly of considerable importance.\n\nA famous market for grain is held here, which is attended by the tribe\nof the Atlas: the country abounds in grain and cattle of the finest\nbreed.\n\nBulawan or Bou-el-Awan, \"father of commodious ways or journeys,\" is a\nsmall town of 300 houses, with an old castle, formerly a place of\nconsequence; and lying on an arm of the river Omm-Erbegh _en route_ from\nMorocco to Salee and Mequinez and commanding the passage of the river.\nIt is 80 miles from Morocco, and 110 from Salee. On the opposite side of\nthe river, is the village of Taboulaunt, peopled mostly with Jews and\nferrymen.\n\nSoubeit is a very ancient city on the left bank of the Omm-Erbegh,\nsurrounded with walls, and situate twenty miles from El-Medina in a\nmountainous region abounding with hares; it is inhabited by a tribe of\nthe same name, or probably Sbeita, which is also the name of a tribe\nsouth of Tangier.\n\nMeramer is a city built by the Goths on a fertile plain, near Mount\nBeni-Megher, about fourteen miles east of Saffee, in the province of\nDukkala, and carrying on a great commerce in oil and grain.\n\nEl-Medina is a large walled populous city of merchants and artizans, and\ncapital of the district of Haskowra; the men are seditious, turbulent\nand inhospitable; the women are reputed to be fair and pretty, but\ndisposed, when opportunity offers, to confer their favours on strangers.\n\nThere is another place four miles distant of nearly the same name.\n\nTagodast is another equally large and rich city of the province of\nHaskowra crowning the heights of a lofty mountain surrounded by four\nother mountains, but near a plain of six miles in extent, covered with\nrich vegetation producing an immense quantity of Argan oil, and the\nfinest fruits.\n\nThis place contains about 7,000 inhabitants, who are a noble and\nhospitable race. Besides, Argan oil, Tagodast is celebrated for its red\ngrapes, which are said to be as large as hen's eggs--the honey of\nTagodast is the finest in Africa. The inhabitants trade mostly with the\nsouth.\n\nDimenet or Demnet is a considerable town, almost entirely populated by\nthe Shelouhs and Caraaite Jews; it is situate upon the <DW72>s of a\nmountain of the same name, or Adimmei, in the district of Damnat,\nfifteen miles distant from Wad Tescout, which falls into the Tensift.\nThe inhabitants are reputed to be of a bad and malignant character, but,\nnevertheless, learned in Mussulman theology, and fond of disputing with\nforeigners. Orthodoxy and morality are frequently enemies of one\nanother, whilst good-hearted and honest people are often hetherodox in\ntheir opinions.\n\nAghmat, formerly a great and flourishing city and capital of the\nprovince of Rhamna, built by the Berbers, and well fortified--is now\nfallen into decay, and consists only of a miserable village inhabited by\nsome sixty families, among which are a few Jews--Aghmat lies at the foot\nof Mount Atlas, on the road which conducts to Tafilett, near a river of\nthe same name, and in the midst of a fine country abounding in orchards\nand vine-yards; Aghmat was the first capital of the Marabout dynasty.\n\nFronga is a town densely populated almost entirely by Shelouhs and Jews,\nlying about fifteen miles from the Atlas range upon an immense plain\nwhich produces the finest grain in Morocco.\n\nTednest, the ancient capital of the province of Shedmah, and built by\nthe Berbers, is deliciously placed upon a paridisical plain, and was\nonce the residence of the Shereefs. It contains a population of four\nthousand souls, one thousand eight hundred being Jews occupied with\ncommerce, whilst the rest cultivate the land. This is a division of\nlabour amongst Mahometans and Israelites not unfrequent in North Africa.\nBut, as in Europe, the Jew is the trader, not the husbandman.\n\nTekoulet is a small and pretty town, rising a short distance from the\nsea, by the mouth of the stream Dwira, in the province of Hhaha. The\nwater is reckoned the best in the province, and the people are honest\nand friendly; the Jews inhabit one hundred houses.\n\nTesegdelt, is another city of the province of Hhaha, very large and\nrich, perched high upon a mountain, and that fortified by nature. The\nprincipal mosque is one of the finest in the empire.\n\nTagawost is a city, perhaps the most ancient, and indeed the largest of\nthe province of Sous. It is distant ten miles from the great river Sous,\nand fifty from the Atlas. The suburbs are surrounded with huge blocks of\nstone. Togawost contains a number of shops and manufactories of good\nworkmen, who are divided into three distinct classes of people, all\nengaged in continual hostilities with one another. The men are, however,\nhonest and laborious, while the women are pretty and coquettish. People\nbelieve St. Augustine, whom the Mahometans have dubbed a Marabout, was\nborn in this city. Their trade is with the Sahara and Timbuctoo.\n\nFedsi is another considerable city, anciently the capital of Sous,\nreclining upon a large arm of the river Sous, amidst a fruitful soil,\nand contains about fourteen thousand inhabitants, who are governed by\nrepublican institutions. It is twenty miles E.N.E. of Taroudant.\n\nBeneali is a town placed near to the source of the river Draha, in the\nAtlas. It is the residence of the chief of the Berbers of Hadrar, on the\nsouthern Atlas.\n\nBeni-Sabih, Moussabal, or Draha, is the capital of the province of\nDraha, and a small place, but populated and commercial. On the river of\nthe same name, was the Draha of ancient geography.\n\nTatta and Akka, are two towns or villages of the province of Draha,\nsituate on the southern confines of Morocco, and points of rendezvous\nfor the caravans in their route over the Great Desert.\n\nTatta is four days direct east from Akka, and placed in 28 deg. 3' lat. and\n90 deg. 20' long. west of Paris. Akka consists of two hundred houses,\ninhabited by Mussulmen, and fifty by Jews. The environs are highly\ncultivated. Akka is two days east of Wadnoun, situate on a plain at the\nfoot of Gibel-Tizintit, and is placed in 28 deg. 3' lat. and 10 deg. 51' long.\nwest of Paris.\n\nMessah, or Assah. Messa is, according to Graeberg, a walled city, built\nby the Berbers, not far from the river Sous, and divided like nearly all\nthe cities of Sous, into three parts, or quarters, each inhabited by\nrespective classes of Shelouhs, Moors, and Jews. Cities are also divided\nin this manner in the provinces of Guzzala and Draha. The sea on the\ncoast of Sous throws up a very fine quantity of amber. Male whales are\noccasionally visitors here. The population is three thousand, but Mr.\nDavidson's account differs materially. The town is named Assah, and\ndistant about two miles from the sea, there being a few scattered houses\non each side of the river, to within half a mile of the sea. The place\nis of no importance, famed only for having near it a market on Tuesday,\nto which many people resort. The population may be one hundred. Assah is\nalso the name of the district though which the Sous river flows. The\nBas-el-wad (or head of the river) is very properly the name of the upper\npart of the river; when passing through Taroudant it takes the name of\nSous. Fifteen miles from Assah is the town of Aghoulon, containing about\nsix hundred people.\n\nTalent, or Tilin, the difference only is the adding of the Berber\ntermination. The other consonants are the same, perhaps, as Mr. Davidson\nincidentally mentions. It is a strong city, and capital of the province\nof Sous-el-Aksa, or the extreme part of Sous. This province is sometimes\ncalled Tesset, or Tissert. A portion of it is also denominated\nBlad-Sidi-Hasham, and forms a free and quasi-independant state, founded\nin 1810 by the Emir Hasham, son of the Shereef Ahmed Ben Mousa. This\nprince was the bug-bear of Captain Riley. The district contains upwards\nof twenty-five thousand Shelouhs and industrious Arabs. Talent is the\nresidence of the prince, and is situate on the declivity of a hill, not\nfar from the river Wad-el-Mesah, or Messa, and a mile from Ilekh, or\nIlirgh, a populous village, where there is a famous sanctuary, resorted\nto by the Mahometans of the surrounding regions, of the name of Sidi\nHamed-ou-Mousa, (probably Ben Mousa). The singularity of this sacred\nvillage is, that Jews constitute the majority of the population. But\nthey seem absolutely necessary to the very existence of the Mussulmen of\nNorth Africa, who cannot live without them, or make profitable exchange\nof the products of the soil, or of native industry, for European\narticles of use and luxury.\n\nShtouka, or Stuka, is, according to some, a large town or village; or,\nas stated by Davidson, a _district_. The fact is, many African districts\nare called by the name of a principal town or village in them, and _vice\nversa_. This place stands on the banks of the Wad-el-Mesah, and is\ninhabited by some fifteen hundred Shelouhs, who are governed by a\nSheikh, nearly independent of Morocco.\n\nOn Talent and Shtouka, Mr. Davidson remarks. \"There is no town called\nStuka; it is a district; none that I can find called Talent; there is\nTilin. The Mesah flows through Stuka, in which district are twenty\nsettlements, or rather towns, some of which are large. They are known in\ngeneral by the names of the Sheikhs who inhabit them. I stopped at\nSheikh Hamed's. Tilin was distant from this spot a day's journey in the\nmountains towards the source of the river. If by Talent, Tissert is\nmeant, Oferen (a town) is distant six miles.\"\n\nOn the province of Sous generally, Don J.A. Conde has this note:--\n\n\"In this region (Sous) near the sea, is the temple erected in honour of\nthe prophet Jonas; it was there he was cast out of the belly of the\nwhale.\" This temple, says Assed Ifriki, is made of the bones of whales\nwhich perish on this coast. A little further on, he alludes to the\nbreaking of horses, and being skilful in bodily exercises, for the Moors\nand Numidians have always been renowned in that respect.\n\nIn the lesser and more remote towns, I have followed generally the\nenumeration of Count Graeberg, but there are many other places on the\nmaps, with varieties of names or differences of position. Our geography\nof the interior of Morocco, especially in the South, is still very\nobscure, and I have only selected those towns and places of whose\npresent existence there is no question. My object, in the above\nenumeration, has been simply to give the reader a proximate estimate of\nthe population and resources of this country. Of the strength and number\nof the tribes of the interior, we know scarcely anything. The names of\nthe towns and villages of the South, so frequently beginning and ending\nwith T., sufficiently indicate the preponderance of the Berber\npopulation, under the names of Shelouh or Amazirgh, whilst the great\nerror of writers has been to represent the Arabs as more numerous than\nthis aboriginal population.\n\nMonsieur E. Renou, in his geographical description of the Empire of\nMorocco (Vol. VIII. of the \"Exploration Scientifique,\" &c.) foolishly\nobserves that there is no way of arriving at correct statistics of this\nempire, except by comparing it with Algeria; and then remarks, which is\ntrue enough, \"Malheureusement, la population de l'Algerie n'est pas\nencore bien connue.\" When, however, he asserts that the numbers of\npopulation given by Jackson and Graeberg are gross, and almost\nunpardonable exaggerations, given at hazard, I am obliged to agree with\nhim from the personal experience I had in Morocco, and these Barbary\ncountries generally.\n\nJackson makes the whole of the population to amount to almost fifteen\nmillions, or nearly two thirds more than it probably amounts to. Graeberg\nestimates it at eight millions and a half. But how, or why, or\nwherefore, such estimates are made is not so easy to determine. Certain\nit is, that the whole number of cities which I have enumerated, scarcely\nrepresent one million of inhabitants. But for those who like to see\nsomething more definite in statistics, however exaggerated may be the\nestimate, I shall give the more moderate calculations of Graeberg, those\nof Jackson being beyond all rhyme or reason. Graeberg thus classifies and\nestimates the population.\n\n  Amazirghs, Berbers, and Touaricks       2,300,000\n  Amazirghs, Shelouhs and Arabs           1,450,000\n  Arabs, mixed Moors, &c.                 3,550,000\n  Arabs pure, Bedouins, &c.                 740,000\n  Israelites, Rabbinists, and Caraites      339,500\n  <DW64>s, Fullans, and Mandingoes          120,000\n  Europeans and Christians                      300\n  Renegades                                     200\n                                         ----------\n                Total                     8,500,000\n\nIf two millions are deducted from this amount, perhaps the reader will\nhave something like a probable estimate of the population of Morocco. It\nis hardly correct to classify Moors as mixed Arabs, many of them being\nsimply descendants of the aboriginal Amazirghs. I am quite sure there\nare no Touaricks in the Empire of Morocco.\n\nOf the Maroquine Sahara, I have only space to mention the interesting\ncluster of oases of Figheegh, or Figuiq. Shaw mentions them as \"a knot\nof villagers,\" noted for their plantations of palm-trees, supplying the\nwestern province of Algeria with dates. We have now more ample\ninformation of Figheegh, finding this Saharan district to consist of an\nagglomeration of twelve villages, the more considerable of which are\nMaiz, counting eight hundred houses, El-Wadghir five hundred, and Zenega\ntwelve hundred. The others vary from one or two hundred houses. The\nvillages are more or less connected together, never farther apart than a\nquarter of a league, and placed on the descent of Wal-el-Khalouf (\"river\nof the wild boar\") whence water is procured for the gardens, containing\nvarieties of fruit-trees and abundance of date-palms, all hedged round\nwith prickly-pears. Madder-root and tobacco are also cultivated, besides\nbarley sufficient for consumption. The wheat is brought from the Teli.\nThe Wad-el-Khalouf is dry, except in winter, but its bed is bored with\ninexhaustible wells, whose waters are distributed among the gardens by\nmeans of a _clepsydra_, or a vessel which drops so much water in an\nhour. The ancients measured time by the dropping of water, like the\nfalling of sand in the hour-glass.\n\nSome of the houses in these villages have two stories, and are well\nbuilt; each place has its mosque, its school, its kady, and its sheikh,\nand the whole agglomeration of oases is governed by a Sheikh Kebir,\nappointed by the Sultan of Morocco. These Saharan villages are eternally\nin strife with one another, and sometimes take up arms. On this account,\nthey are surrounded by crenated walls, defended by towers solidly built.\nThe immediate cause of discord here is water, that precious element of\nall life in the desert. But the imaginations of the people are not\nsatisfied with this simple reason, and they are right, for the cause\nlies deeply in the human heart. They say, however, their ancestors were\ncursed by a Marabout, to punish them for their laxity in religion, and\nthis was his anathema, \"God make you, until the day of judgment, like\nwool-comber's cards, the one gnawing the other!\"\n\nTheir wars, in fact, are most cruel, for they destroy the noble and\nfruitful palms, which, by a tacit convention, are spared in other parts\nof the Sahara when these quarrels proceed to bloodshed. They have,\nbesides, great tact in mining, and their reputation as miners has been a\nlong time established. But, happily, they are addicted to commerce and\nvarious branches of industry, as well as war, having commercial\nrelations with Fez, Tafilett and Touat, and the people are, therefore,\ngenerally prosperous.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nLondon Jew-boys.--Excursion to the Emperor's garden, and the Argan\nForests.--Another interview with the Governor of Mogador on the\nAnti-Slavery Address.--Opinion of the Moors on the Abolition of Slavery.\n\n\nWe have at times imported into Mogador a stray London Jew or so, of the\nlower lemon-selling sort. These lads from the Minories, are highly\nexasperated against the Moors for treating them with so much contempt.\nIndeed, a high-spirited London Jew-boy will not stop at Mogador, though\nthe adult merchant will, to get money, for mankind often learn baseness\nwith age, and pass to it through a golden door. One of these Jew-boys,\nbeing cursed by a man, naturally cursed him again, \"an eye for an eye, a\ntooth for a tooth.\" Mr. Willshire did not think so; and, on the\ncomplaint of the Moor, the British Consul threw the British Jew-boy into\na Moorish prison, where he remained for some days. This is one more\ninstance of the disadvantage of having commercial consuls, where\neverything is sacrificed to keep on good terms with government\nauthorities.\n\nA fire happened the other night, breaking out in the house of one of the\nrich Jewish merchants; but it was soon extinguished, the houses being\nbuilt chiefly of mortar and stone, with very little wood. The Governor\ngot up, and went to the scene of \"conflagration;\" he cracked a few jokes\nwith the people and went home to bed. The Moors were sorry the fire did\nnot extend itself, wanting to have an opportunity of appropriating a few\nof the merchant's goods.\n\nI accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Elton, with other friends, to spend the day\nin the pleasant valley of the Saneeates-Sultan, (Garden of the Emperor)\nsometimes called Gharset-es-Sultan, three or four hours' ride south from\nMogador. The small river of Wad-el-Kesab, (overlooked by the village of\nDeeabat, where watch-dogs were barking apparently all day long as well\nas night), lay in our way, and was with difficulty forded, heavy rain\nhaving fallen up the country, though none on the coast. These Barbary\nstreams are very deceptive, illustrating the metaphor of the book of\nJob, \"deceitful as a brook.\" To-day, their beds are perfectly dry;\nto-morrow, a sheet of turbid water dashing and foaming to the ocean,\ncovers them and the country round, whilst the immediate cause is\nconcealed. Abrupt and sudden overflowings occur in all rivers having\ntheir source in mountains. The book of Job may also refer to the\ndisappointment of Saharan travellers, who, on arriving weary and\nthirsty, dying for water, at the stream of the Desert, find it dried up,\nand so perish.\n\nThe country in the valley of the Emperor's garden offers nothing\nremarkable. Bushes of underwood covering sandy mounds, a few palmettos\nand Argan trees, in which wild doves fluttered and flew about, were all\nthat broke the monotony of a perfect waste. There were no cultivated\nlands hereabouts, and I was told that a great part of Morocco presents\nthis desolate aspect. We visited, however, the celebrated Argan tree,\nwhich the people pretend was planted by the lieutenant of the Prophet,\nthe mighty Okba, who, having spurred his horse in the roaring rebellious\nsurge of the Atlantic, wept and wailed before Heaven that there were no\nmore nations in whose heart to plunge his awful scimitar--so teaching\nthem the mercy of God! Alas! the old hoary tree, with a most peaceful\npatriarchal look, seemed to belie the honour, stretching out its broad\nsinewy arm to shelter a hundred people from the darting fires of an\nAfrican sun. A more noble object of inanimate nature is not to be\ncontemplated than a large and lofty branching tree; in its boughs and\nleaves, endlessly varying, matted together and intersecting each other,\nwe see the palpable image of infinity. But in the dry and hot climate of\nAfrica, this tree is a luxury which cannot be appreciated in Europe.\n\nWe sat under its fresh shade awhile, gazing with security at the bright\nfires of the sun, radiating over and through all visible nature. To\ncheck our enthusiasm, we had strewn at our feet old broken bottles and\ncrockery, the _debris_ and classic relics of former visitors, who were\nequally attentive to creature-comforts as to the grandeur of the Argan\nmonarch of the surrounding forest.\n\nThe Emperor's garden contains a well of water and a few fruit-trees, on\nthe trunk of one of which, a fine fig-tree, were carved, in durable\nbark, the names of European visitors. Among the rest, that of a famous\n_belle_, whose gallant worshippers had cut her name over all its broad\ntrunk, though they may have failed to cut their own on the plastic and\nindia-rubber tablet of the fair one's heart. This carving on the\nfig-tree is the sum of all that Europeans have done in Morocco during\nseveral ages. We rather adopt Moorish habits, and descend to their\nanimal gratifications than inculcate our own, or the intellectual\npleasures of Christian nations. European females brought up in this\ncountry, few excepted, adopt with gusto the lascivious dances of the\nMooresses; and if this may be said of them, what may we not think of the\nmale class, who frequently throw off all restraint in the indulgence of\ntheir passions?\n\nWhile reposing under the umbrageous shade of the Argan tree, a Moor\nrelated to us wondrous sprite and elfin tales of the forests of of these\nwilds. At one period, the Argan woods were full of enchantresses, who\nprevented good Mussulmen from saying their prayers, by dancing before\nthem in all their natural charms, to the sounds of melodious and\nvoluptuous music; and if a poor son of the Prophet, perchance, passed\nthis way at the stated times of prayer, he found it impossible to attend\nto his devotions, being pestered to death by these naughty houries.\n\nOn another occasion, when it was high summer and the sun burnt every\nleaf of the black Argan foliage to a yellow red, and whilst the arid\nearth opened her mouth in horrid gaps, crystal springs of water were\nseen to bubble forth from the bowels of the earth, and run in rills\namong _parterres_ of roses and jessamines. The boughs of the Argan tree\nalso suddenly changed into _jereeds_ of the date-palm burdened with\nluscious fruit; but, on weary travellers descending to slake their\nparching thirst and refresh themselves, they fell headlong into the\ngaping holes of the ground, and disappeared in the abyss of the dark\nentrails of the world.\n\nThese Argan forests continued under the fearful ban of the enchantress\nand wicked jinns, until a holy man was brought from the farthest desert\nupon the back of a flying camel, who set free the spell-bound wood by\ntying on each bewitched tree a small piece of cork bark on which was\ninscribed the sacred name of the Deity. The legends of these haunted\nArgan forests remind us of the enchanted wood of Tasso, whose\nenchantment was dissolved by the gallant knight, Rinaldo, and which\nenabled the Crusaders to procure wood for the machines of war to assault\nand capture the Holy City. Two quotations will shew the universality and\npermanence of superstition, begotten of human hopes and fears. Such is\nthe beautiful imagery devoted to superstitious musings, by the\nillustrious bard:--\n\n  \"While, like the rest, the knight expects to hear\n  Loud peals of thunder breaking on his ear,\n  A dulcet symphony his sense invades,\n  Of nymphs, or dryads, warbling through the shades.\n  Soft sighs the breeze, soft purls the silver rill.\n  The feathered choir the woods with music fill;\n  The tuneful swan in dying notes complains;\n  The mourning nightingale repeats her strains,\n  Timbrels and harps and human voices join,\n  And in one concert all the sounds combine!\"\n\nThen for the streamlets and flowerets--\n\n  \"Where'er he treads, the earth her tribute pours,\n  In gushing springs, or voluntary flowers.\n  Here blooms the lily; there the fragrant rose;\n  Here spouts a fountain; there a riv'let flows;\n  From every spray the liquid manna trills,\n  And honey from the softening bark distills.\n  Again the strange the pleasing sound he hears,\n  Of plaints and music mingling in his ears;\n  Yet naught appears that mortal voice can frame.\n  Nor harp, nor timbrel, whence the music came.\"\n\nI had another interview with the Governor on Anti-Slavery subjects. Mr.\nTreppass accompanied me, and assisted to interpret. His Excellency was\nvery condescending, and even joked about his own slaves, asking me how\nmuch I would give him for them. He then continued:--\"I am happy to see\nyou before your departure. Whilst you have been here, I have heard\nnothing of your conduct but what was just and proper. You are a quiet\nand prudent man, [28] and I am sorry I could not assist you in your\nbusiness (abolition). The Sultan will be glad that you and I have not\nquarrelled, but are friends.\" I then asked His Excellency if a person\nwere to come direct from our Government, with larger powers and\npresents, he would have a better chance of success. The Governor\nreplied, \"Not the least whatever. You have done all that could have been\ndone. We look at the subject, not the persons. The Sultan will never\nlisten to anybody on this subject. You may cut off his head, but cannot\nconvince him. If all the Christians of the world were to come and take\nthis country, then, of course, the Mussulmen would yield the question to\nsuperior force, to the decree of God, but not till then.\"\n\nMyself.--\"How is it, Sidi, that the Bey of Tunis, and the Imaum of\nMuscat have entered into engagements with Christians for the suppression\nof slavery, they being Mussulmen?\"\n\nThe Governor.--\"I'll tell you; we Mussulmen are as bad as you Christians.\nWe are full of divisions and sects. Some of our people go to one mosque,\nand will not go to another. They are foolish (_mahboul_). So it is with\nthe subject of slaves. Some are with you, but most are with me. The Bey\nof Tunis, and the Imaum have a different opinion from us.  They think\nthey are right, and we think we are right; but we are as good as they.\"\n\nMyself.--\"Sidi, does not the Koran encourage the abolition of slavery,\nand command it as a duty to all pious Mussulmen?\"\n\nThe Governor.--\"No, it does not command it, but those who voluntarily\nliberate their slaves are therein commended, and have the blessing of\nGod on them.\" [29]\n\nMyself.--\"Sidi, is it in my power to do anything for you in London?\"\n\nThe Governor.--\"Speak well of me, that is all. Tell your friends I did\nall I could for you.\"\n\nI may mention the opinions of the more respectable Moors, as to the\nmission. They said, \"If you had managed your mission well, the Sultan\nwould have received your Address; your Consul is slack; the French\nConsul is more active, because he is not the Sultan's merchant. Our\nSultan must receive every person, even a beggar, because God receives\nall. You would not have obtained the liberation of our slaves, but the\nSultan would have promised you everything. All that emanates from the\nEnglish people is good this we are certain of; but it would have been\nbetter had you come with letters from the Bey of Tunis, shewing what had\nbeen done in that country.\" Mr. Treppass is also of the opinion, that a\ndeputation of several persons, accompanied with some presents for the\nEmperor and his ministers, would have produced a better effect, by\nmaking an appearance of shew and authority, suitable to the ideas of the\npeople. [30] If coming direct from Government, it would have greater\nweight.\n\nHe thinks, besides, there are a good number of Moors who are favourable\nto abolition. Of the connexion between the east and Morocco, he says,\nall the Barbary States look up to the Sultan of Constantinople as to a\ngreat authority, and during the last few years, an active\ncorrespondence, on religious matters, has been carried on between\nMorocco and Constantinople, chiefly through a celebrated doctor of the\nname of Yousef. If the Turkish Sultan, therefore, would _bona-fide_\nabolish the slave-markets, I have no doubt this would produce an\nimpression in Morocco favourable to abolition.\n\nDuring the time I was in Morocco, I distributed some Arabic tracts,\ntranslated from the English by Professor Lee of Cambridge, on the\nabolition of slavery. A few Arabic Bibles and Hebrew New Testaments were\nalso placed at my disposal for circulation by the Societies. I also\nwrote an Anti-slavery circular to the British merchants of Mogador, on\nLord Brougham's Act.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nEl-Jereed, the Country of Dates.--Its hard soil.--Salt Lake. Its vast\nextent.--Beautiful Palm-trees.--The Dates, a staple article of Food.--\nSome Account of the Date-Palm.--Made of Culture.--Delicious Beverage.--\nTapping the Palm.--Meal formed from the Dates.--Baskets made of the\nBranches of the Tree.--Poetry of the Palm.--Its Irrigation.--\nPalm-Groves.--Collection of Tribute by the \"Bey of the Camp.\"\n\n\nEl-Jereed, or Belad-el-Jereed, the country of dates, or literally, the\ncountry of the palm branches, is a part of the Sahara, or the hot dry\ncountry lying in the immediate vicinity of the Great Desert. Its\nprincipal features of soil and climate offer nothing different from\nother portions of the Sahara, or the Saharan regions of Algeria and\nMorocco. The Belad-el-Jereed, therefore, may be properly called the\nTunisian Sahara. Shaw observes generally of Jereed:--\"This part of the\ncountry, and indeed the whole tract of land which lies between the\nAtlantic and Egypt, is by most of the modern geographers, called\nBiledulgerid, a name which they seem to have borrowed from\nBloid-el-Jeridde, of the Arabians, who merely signify the dry country;\nthough, if we except the Jeridde, a small portion of it which is situate\non this side of Lesser Syrtis, and belongs to the Tunisians, all the\nrest of it is known by no other general name than the Sahara or Sahra,\namong those Arabs, at least, whom I have conversed with.\"\n\nBesides the grand natural feature of innumerable lofty and branching\npalms, whose dark depending slender leaves, are depicted by the Arabian\npoet as hanging gracefully like the dishevelled ringlets of a beautiful\nwoman in distress, there is the vast salt lake, El-Sibhah, or literally\nthe \"salt plain,\" and called by some modern geographers the\nSibhah-el-Soudeeat, or Lake of Marks, from having certain marks made of\nthe trunks of the palm, to assist the caravans in their marches across\nits monotonous samelike surface.\n\nThis vast lake, or salt plain, was divided by the ancients into three\nparts, and denominated respectively, Palus Tritonis, Palus Pallas, and\nPalus Libya. The first is derived from the river Triton, which according\nto Ptolemy and other ancient geographers, is made to pass through this\nlake in its course to the sea, but which is the present river Ghobs,\nwhere it falls into the Mediterranean. The name Pallas is derived from\nthe tradition of Pallas having accompanied Sesostris in his Asiatic\nexpeditions with the Lybian women, and she may have been a native of the\nJereed. The lake measures from north-east to south-west about seventy\nEnglish miles, with a third of the breadth, but it is not one collection\nof water; there being several dry places, like so many islands,\ninterspersed over its surface, depending however, as to their number and\nextent upon the season of the year, and upon the quantity of water in\nthe particular season.\n\n\"At first, on crossing it,\" says a tourist, \"the grass and bushes become\ngradually scarcer; then follows a tract of sand, which some way beyond,\nbecomes in parts covered with a thin layer of salt. This, as you\nadvance, is thicker and more united; then we find it a compact and\nunbroken mass or sheet, which can, however, be penetrated by a sword, or\nother sharp instrument, and here it was found to be eleven inches in\ndepth; and finally in the centre, it became so hard, deep, and\nconcentrated, as to baffle all attempts at breaking its surface except\nwith a pickaxe. The horse's shoe, in fact, makes no impression upon its\nstone-like surface.\"\n\nThe salt of the lake is considerably weaker than that of the sea, and\nnot adapted for preserving provisions, though its flavour is very\nagreeable; it is not exported, nor made in any way an article of\ncommerce.\n\nThe Jereed, from the existence in it of a few antiquities, such as\npieces of granite and marble, and occasionally a name or a classic\ninscription, is proved to have been in the possession of the Romans, and\nundoubtedly of the Carthaginians before them, who could have had no\ndifficulty in holding this flat and exposed country.\n\nThe trade and resources of this country consist principally in dates.\nThe quantity exported to other parts of the Regency, as well as to\nforeign countries, where their fine quality is well known, is in round\nnumbers on an average from three to four thousand quintals per annum.\nBut in Jereed itself, twenty thousand people live six months of the year\nentirely on dates.\n\n\"A great number of poles,\" says Sir Grenville Temple, \"are arranged\nacross the rooms at the height of eight or nine feet from the ground,\nand from these are suspended rich and large bunches of dates, which\ncompose the winter store of the inhabitants; and in one corner of the\nroom is one or more large earthern jars about six or seven feet high,\nalso filled with dates pressed close together, and at the bottom of the\njar is a cock, from which is drawn the juice in the form of a thick\nluscious syrup. It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more\npalatable than this 'sweet of sweets.'\"\n\nAs we are writing of the country of dates, _par excellence_, I must\nneeds give some description of the palm, but it will be understood that\nthe information is Tunisian, or collected in Tunis, and may differ in\nsome respects from details collected in other parts of North Africa. The\ndate-palm abounds in the maritime as well as in the inland districts of\nNorth Africa. They are usually propagated from shoots of full grown\ntrees, which if transplanted and taken care of, will yield in six or\nseven years, whilst those raised immediately from the stone require\nsixteen years to produce fruit.\n\nThe date-palm is male and female, or _dioecious_, and requires\ncommunication, otherwise the fruit is dry and insipid. The age of the\npalm, in its greatest vigour, is about thirty years, according to the\nTunisians, after planting, and will continue in vigour for seventy\nyears, bearing anually fifteen or twenty clusters of dates, each of them\nfifteen or twenty pounds in weight; after this long period, they begin\ngradually to wither away. But the Saharan Tripolitans will tell you that\nthe date-palm does not attain its age of full vigour till it reaches a\nhundred years, and then will flourish two or or three centuries before\nit withers!\n\nThe only culture requisite, is to be well watered at the roots once in\nfour or five days, and to have the lower boughs cut off when they begin\nto droop and wither. Much rain, however, injures the dates, and we know\nthat the countries in which they flourish, are mostly without rain. In\nmany localities in Africa, date-palms can never be watered in the dry\nseason; it is nevertheless observable that generally wherever a palm\ngrows and thrives water may usually be obtained by boring. The sap, or\nhoney of the palm is a delicious and wholesome beverage when drunk quite\nfresh; but if allowed to remain for some hours, it acquires a sharp\ntaste, something like cider, and becomes very intoxicating. It is called\npoetically _leghma_, \"tears\" of the dates. When a tree is found not to\nproduce much fruit, the head is cut off, and a bowl or cavity scooped\nout of the summit, in which the rising sap is collected, and this is\ndrunk in its pure state without any other preparation. If the tree be\nnot exhausted by draining, in five or six months it grows afresh; and,\nat the end of two or three years, may again be cut or tapped. The palm\nis capable of undergoing this operation five or six times, and it may be\neasily known how often a tree has been cut by the number of rings of a\nnarrow diameter which are seen towards its summit; but, if the sap is\nallowed to flow too long, it will perish entirely at the end of a year.\nThis sap, by distillation, produces an agreeable spirit called _Araky_\nor _Arak_: from the fruit also the Jews distil a spirit called _bokka_,\nor what we should call _toddy_. It is usual for persons of distinction\nto entertain their friends upon a marriage, or the birth of a child,\nwith this pure sap, and a tree is usually tapped for the purpose. It\nwould appear that tapping the palm was known to the ancients, for a\ncornelian _intaglio_ of Roman antiquity, has been found in the Jereed,\nrepresenting a tree in this state, and the jars in which the juice was\nplaced.\n\nDates are likewise dried in the sun, and reduced into a kind of meal,\nwhich will keep for any length of time, and which thus becomes a most\nvaluable resource for travellers crossing the deserts, who frequently\nmake it their only food, moistening a handful of it with a little water.\nCertain preparations are made of the male plant, to which medicinal\nvirtues are attributed; the younger leaves, eaten with salt, vinegar,\nand oil, make an excellent salad. The heart of the tree, which lies at\ntop between the fruit branches, and weighs from ten to twenty pounds, is\neaten only on grand occasions, as those already mentioned, and possesses\na delicious flavour between that of a banana and a pine-apple.\n\nThe palm, besides these valuable uses to which it is applied,\nsuperseding or supplying the place of all other vegetables to the tribes\nof the Jereed, is, nevertheless, still useful for a great variety of\nother purposes. The most beautiful baskets, and a hundred other\nnick-nackery of the wickery sort are made of its branches; ropes are\nmade and vestments wove from the long fibres, and its wood, also, when\nhardened by age, is used for building. Indeed, we may say, it is the all\nand everything of the Jereed, and, as it is said of the camel and the\ndesert, _the palm is made for the Jereed, and the Jereed is made for the\npalm_.\n\nThe Mussulmen make out a complete case of piety and superstition in the\npalm, and pretend that _they are made for the palm, and the palm is made\nfor them_, alleging that, as soon as the Turks conquered Constantinople,\nthe palm raised its graceful flowing head over the domes of the former\ninfidel city, whilst when the Moors evacuated Spain, the palm pined\naway, and died. \"God,\" adds the pious Mussulman, \"has given us the palm;\namongst the Christians, it will not grow!\" But the poetry of the palm is\nan inseparable appendage in the North African landscape, and even town\nscenery. The Moor and the Arab, whose minds are naturally imbued with\nthe great images of nature, so glowingly represented also in the sacred\nleaves of the Koran, cannot imagine a mosque or the dome-roof of a\nhermitage, without the dark leaf of the palm overshadowing it; but the\nserenest, loveliest object on the face of the landscape is _the lonely\npalm_, either thrown by chance on the brow of some savage hill or\nplanted by design to adorn some sacred spot of mother-earth.\n\nI must still give some other information which I have omitted respecting\nthis extraordinary tree. And, after this, I further refer the reader to\na Tour in the Jereed of which some details are given in succeeding\npages. A palm-grove is really a beautiful object, and requires scarcely\nless attention than a vineyard. The trees are generally planted in a\n_quincunx_, or at times without any regular order; but at distances from\neach other of four or five yards. The situation selected is mostly on\nthe banks of some stream or rivulet, running from the neighbouring\nhills, and the more abundant the supply of water, the healthier the\nplants and the finer the fruit. For this tree, which loves a warm\nclimate, and a sandy soil, is yet wonderfully improved by frequent\nirrigation, and, singularly, the _quality_ of the water appears of\nlittle consequence, being salt or sweet, or impregnated with nitre, as\nin the Jereed.\n\nIrrigation is performed in the spring, and through the whole summer. The\nwater is drawn by small channels from the stream to each individual\ntree, around the stalk and root of which a little basin is made and\nfenced round with clay, so that the water, when received, is detained\nthere until it soaks into the earth. (All irrigation is, indeed,\neffected in this way.) As to the abundance of the plantations, the fruit\nof one plantation alone producing fifteen hundred camels' loads of\ndates, or four thousand five hundred quintals, three quintals to the\nload, is not unfrequently sold for one thousand dollars. Besides the\nJereed, Tafilett, in Morocco, is a great date-country. Mr. Jackson says,\n\"We found the country covered with most magnificent plantations, and\nextensive forests of the lofty date, exhibiting the most elegant and\npicturesque appearance that nature on a plain surface can present to the\nadmiring eye. In these forests, there is no underwood, so that a\nhorseman may gallop through them without impediment.\"\n\nOur readers will see, when they come to the Tour, that this description\nof the palm-groves agrees entirely with that of Mr. Reade and Captain\nBalfour. I have already mentioned that the palm is male and female, or,\nas botanists say, _dioecious_; the Moors, however, pretend that the palm\nin this respect is just like the human being. The _female_ palm alone\nproduces fruit and is cultivated, but the presence or vicinity of the\n_male_ is required, and in many oriental countries there is a law that\nthose who own a palm-wood must have a certain number of _male_ plants in\nproportion. In Barbary they seem to trust to chance, relying on the male\nplants which grow wild in the Desert. They hang and shake them over the\nfemale plants, usually in February or March. Koempfe says, that the male\nflowers, if plucked when ripe, and cautiously dried, will even, in this\nstate, perform their office, though kept to the following year.\n\nThe Jereed is a very important portion of the Tunisian territory,\nGovernment deriving a large revenue from its inhabitants. It is visited\nevery year by the \"Bey of the Camp,\" who administers affairs in this\ncountry as a sovereign; and who, indeed, is heir-apparent to the\nTunisian throne. Immediately on the decease of the reigning Bey, the\n\"Bey of the Camp\" occupies the hereditary beylick, and nominates his\nsuccessor to the camp and the throne, usually the eldest of the other\nmembers of the royal family, the beylick not being transmitted from\nfather to son, only on the principle of age. At least, this has been the\ngeneral rule of succession for many years.\n\nThe duties of the \"Bey of the Camp\" is to visit with a \"flying-camp,\"\nfor the purpose of collecting tribute, the two circuits or divisions of\nthe Regency.\n\nI now introduce to the reader the narrative of a Tour to the Jereed,\nextracted from the notebooks of the tourists, together with various\nobservations of my own interspersed, and some additional account of\nToser, Nefta, and Ghafsa.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTour in the Jereed of Captain Balfour and Mr. Reade.--Sidi Mohammed.--\nPlain of Manouba.--Tunis.--Tfeefleeah.--The Bastinado.--Turkish\nInfantry.--Kairwan.--Sidi Amour Abeda.--Saints.--A French Spy--\nAdministration of Justice.--The Bey's presents.--The Hobara.--Ghafsa.\nHot streams containing Fish.--Snakes.--Incantation.--Moorish Village.\n\n\nThe tourists were Captain Balfour, of the 88th Regiment, and Mr. Richard\nReade, eldest son of Sir Thomas Reade.\n\nThe morning before starting from Tunis they went to the Bardo to pay\ntheir respects to Sidi Mohammed, \"Bey of the Camp,\" and to thank him for\nhis condescending kindness in taking them with him to the Jereed. The\nBey told him to send their baggage to Giovanni, \"Guarda-pipa,\" which\nthey did in the evening.\n\nAt nine A. M. Sidi Mohammed left the Bardo under a salute from the guns,\none of the wads of which nearly hit Captain Balfour on the head. The Bey\nproceeded across the plain of Manouba, mounted on a beautiful bay\ncharger, in front of the colours, towards Beereen, the greater part of\nthe troops of the expedition following, whilst the entire plain was\ncovered with baggage-camels, horses, mules, and detached parties of\nattendants, in glorious confusion.\n\n  The force of the camp consisted of--Mamelukes\n  of the Seraglio, superbly mounted               20\n\n  Mamelukes of the Skeefah, or those who\n  guard the entrance of the Bey's\n  palace, or tent, and are all Levantines         20\n\n  Boabs, another sort of guard of the Bey,\n  who are always about the Bey's\n  tent, and must be of this country               20\n\n  Turkish Infantry                               300\n  Spahis, o. mounted Arab guards                 300\n  Camp followers (Arabs)                       2,000\n                                               -----\n             Total                             2,660\n\nThis is certainly not a large force, but in several places of the march\nthey were joined for a short time by additional Arab troops, a sort of\nhonorary welcome for the Bey. As they proceeded, the force of the\ncamp-followers increased; but, in returning, it gradually decreased, the\nparties going home to their respective tribes. We may notice the total\nabsence of any of the new corps, the Nithalm. This may have been to\navoid exciting the prejudices of the people; however, the smallness of\nthe force shows that the districts of the Jereed are well-affected. The\nsummer camp to Beja has a somewhat larger force, the Arabs of that and\nother neighbouring districts not being so loyal to the Government.\n\nBesides the above-named troops, there were two pieces of artillery. The\nband attendant on these troops consisted of two or three flageolets,\nkettle-drums, and trumpets made of cow-horns, which, according to the\nreport of our tourists, when in full play produced the most diabolical\ndiscord.\n\nAfter a ride of about three hours, we pitched our tents at Beereen.\nThrough the whole of the route we marched on an average of about four\nmiles per hour, the horses, camels, &c., walking at a good pace. The\nTurkish infantry always came up about two hours after the mounted\ntroops. Immediately on the tents being pitched, we went to pay our\nrespects to the Bey, accompanied by Giovanni, \"Guardapipa,\" as\ninterpreter. His Highness received us very affably, and bade us ask for\nanything we wanted. Afterwards, we took some luncheon with the Bey's\ndoctor, Signore Nunez Vaise, a Tuscan Jew, of whose kindness during our\nwhole tour it is impossible to speak too highly. The doctor had with him\nan assistant, and tent to himself. Haj Kador, Sidi Shakeer, and several\nother Moors, were of our luncheon-party, which was a very merry one.\n\nAbout half-way to Beereen, the Bey stopped at a marabet, a small square\nwhite house, with a dome roof, to pay his devotions to a great Marabout,\nor saint, and to ask his parting blessing on the expedition. They told\nus to go on, and joined us soon after. Two hours after us, the Turkish\nAgha arrived, accompanied with colours, music, and some thirty men. The\nBey received the venerable old gentleman under an immense tent in the\nshape of an umbrella, surrounded with his mamelukes and officers of\nstate. After their meeting and saluting, three guns were fired. The Agha\nwas saluted every day in the same manner, as he came up with his\ninfantry after us. We retired for the night at about eight o'clock.\n\nThe form of the whole camp, when pitched, consisting of about a dozen\nvery large tents, was as follows:--The Bey's tent in the centre, which\nwas surrounded at a distance of about forty feet with those of the\nBash-Hamba [31] of the Arabs, the Agha of the Arabs, the Sahab-el-Tabah,\nHaznadar or treasurer, the Bash-Boab, and that of the English tourists;\nthen further off were the tents of the Katibs and Bash-Katib, the\nBash-Hamba of the Turks, the doctors, and the domestics of the Bey, with\nthe cookery establishment. Among the attendants of the Bey were the\n\"guarda-pipa,\" guard of the pipe, \"guarda-fusile,\" guard of the gun,\n\"guarda-cafe,\" guard of the coffee, \"guarda-scarpe,\" guard of the shoes,\n[32] and \"guarda-acqua,\" guard of water. A man followed the Bey about\nholding in his hand a golden cup, and leading a mule, having two paniers\non its back full of water, which was brought from Tunis by camels. There\nwas also a story-teller, who entertained the Bey every night with the\nmost extraordinary stories, some of them frightfully absurd. The Bey did\nnot smoke--a thing extraordinary, as nearly all men smoke in Tunis. His\nHighness always dined alone. None of his ladies ever accompany him in\nthese expeditions.\n\nThe tents had in them from twenty to fifty men each. Our tent consisted\nof our two selves, a Boab to guard the baggage, two Arabs to tend the\nhorses and camels, and another Moor of all work, besides Captain\nBalfour's Maltese, called Michael. We had three camels for our baggage.\nThe first night we found very cold; but having abundance of clothing, we\nslept soundly, in spite of the perpetual wild shoutings of the Arab\nsentries, stationed round the camp, the roaring and grumbling of the\ncamels, the neighing and coughing of the horses, all doing their utmost\nto drive away slumber from our eyelids.\n\nWe halted on the morrow, which gave us an opportunity of getting a few\nthings from Tunis which we had neglected to bring. But before returning,\nwe ate some sweetmeats sent us by the guarda-pipa, with a cup of coffee.\nThe guarda-pipa is also a dragoman interpreter of his Highness, and a\nGenoese by birth, but now a renegade. In this country they do not know\nwhat a good breakfast is; they take a cup of coffee in the morning\nearly, and wait till twelve or one o'clock, when they take a hearty\nmeal, and then sup in the evening, late or early, according to the\nseason. Before returning to Tunis, we called upon his Highness, and told\nhim our object. We afterwards called to see the Bey every morning, to\npay our respects to him, as was befitting on these occasions. His\nHighness entered into the most familiar conversation with us.\n\nOn coming back again from Tunis, it rained hard, which continued all\nnight. In the evening the welcome news was proclaimed that the tents\nwould not be struck until daylight: previously, the camp was always\nstruck at 3 o'clock, about three hours before daylight, which gave rise\nto great confusion, besides being without shelter during the coldest\npart of the night (three hours before sun-rise) was a very serious trial\nfor the health of the men. The reason, however, was, to enable the\ncamels to get up to the new encampment; their progress, though regular\nand continual, is very slow.\n\nOf a morning the music played off the _reveil_ an hour before sunrise.\nThe camp presented an animated appearance, with the striking of tents,\npacking camels, mounting horses, &c. We paid our respects to his\nHighness, who was sitting in an Arab tent, his own being down. The music\nwas incessantly grating upon our ears, but was in harmony with the\nirregular marching and movements of the Arabs, one of them occasionally\nrushing out of the line of march, charging, wheeling about, firing,\nreloading, shouting furiously, and making the air ring with his cries.\n\nThe order of march was as follows:--The Bey mounts, and, going along\nabout one hundred yards from the spot, he salutes the Arab guards, who\nfollow behind him; then, about five or six miles further, overtaking the\nTurkish soldiers, who, on his coming up, are drawn up on each side of\nthe road, his Highness salutes them; and then afterwards the\nwater-carriers are saluted, being most important personages in the dry\ncountries of this circuit, and last of all, the gunners; after all\nwhich, the Bey sends forward a mameluke, who returns with the Commander,\nor Agha of the Arabs, to his Highness. This done, the Bey gallops off to\nthe right or left from the line of march, on whichsoever side is most\ngame--the Bey going every day to shoot, whilst the Agha takes his place\nand marches to the next halting-place.\n\nOne morning the Bey shot two partridges while on horseback. \"In fact,\"\nsays Mr. Rade, \"he is the best shot on horseback I ever saw--he seldom\nmissed his game.\" As Captain B. was riding along with the doctor, they\nremarked a cannon-ball among some ruins; but, being told a saint was\nburied there, they got out of the way as quick as if a deadly serpent\nhad been discovered. Stretching away to the left, we saw a portion of\nthe remains of the Carthaginian aqueduct. The march was only from six to\neight miles, and the encampment at Tfeefleeah. At day-break, at noon, at\n3 o'clock, P.M. and at sunset, the Muezzen called from outside and near\nthe door of the Bey's tent the hour of prayer. An aide-de-camp also\nproclaimed, at the same place, whether we should halt, or march, on the\nmorrow, The Arabs consider fat dogs a great delicacy, and kill and eat\nthem whenever they can lay hands upon them. Captain B. was fortunate in\nnot bringing his fat pointer, otherwise he would have lost him. The\nArabs eat also foxes and wolves, and many animals of the chase not\npartaken of by us. The French in Algiers kill all the fat cats, and turn\nthem into hares by dexterous cooking. The mornings and evenings we found\ncold, but mid-day very hot and sultry.\n\nWe left Tfeefleeah early, and went in search of wild-boar; found only\ntheir tracks, but saw plenty of partridges and hares; the ground being\ncovered with brushwood and heath, we soonae lost sight of them. The Arabs\nwere seen on a sudden running and galloping in all directions, shouting\nand pointing to a hill, when a huge beast was put up, bristling and\nbellowing, which turned out to be a hyaena. He was shot by a mameluke, Si\nSmyle, and fell in a thicket, wallowing in his blood. He was a fine\nfellow, and had an immense bead, like a bull-dog. They put him on a\nmule, and carried him in triumph to the Bey. When R. arrived at the\ncamp, the Bey sent him the skin and the head as a present, begging that\nhe would not eat the brain. There is a superstitious belief among the\nMoors that, if a person eats the brain of a hyaena he immediately becomes\nmad. The hyaena is not the savage beast commonly represented; he rarely\nattacks any person, and becomes untameably ferocious by being only\nchained up. He is principally remarkable for his stupidity when at large\nin the woods. The animal abounds in the forests of the Morocco Atlas.\nOur tourists saw no lions _en route_, or in the Jereed; the lion does\nnot like the sandy and open country of the plain. Very thick brushwood,\nand ground broken with rocks, like the ravines of the Atlas, are his\nhaunts.\n\nSeveral Arabs were flogged for having stolen the barley of which they\nhad charge. The bastinado was inflicted by two inferior mamelukes,\nstanding one on each side of the culprit, who had his hands and his feet\ntied behind him. In general, it may be said that bastinadoing in Tunis\nis a matter of form, many of the strokes ordered to be inflicted being\nnever performed, and those given being so many taps or scratches. It is\nvery rare to see a man bleeding from the bastinado; I (the author) never\ndid. It is merely threatened as a terror; whilst it is not to be\noverlooked, that the soles of the feet of Arabs, and the lower classes\nin this country, are like iron, from the constant habit of going\nbarefoot upon the sharpest stones. Severe punishments of any kind are\nrarely inflicted in Tunis.\n\nThe country was nearly all flat desert, with scarcely an inhabitant to\ndissipate its savage appearance. The women of a few Arab horsehair tents\n(waterproof when in good repair) saluted us as we passed with their\nshrill looloos. There appeared a great want of water. We passed the\nruins of several towns and other remains. The camels were always driven\ninto camp at sunset, and hobbled along, their two fore-legs being tied,\nor one of them being tied up to the knee, by which the poor animals are\nmade to cut a more melancholy figure than with their usual awkward gait\nand moody character.\n\nWe continued our march about ten miles in nearly a southern direction,\nand encamped at a place called Heelet-el-Gazlen.\n\nOne morning shortly after starting, we came to a small stream with very\nhigh and precipitous banks, over which one arch of a fine bridge\nremained, but the other being wanting, we had to make a considerable\n_detour_ before we could cross; the carriages had still greater\ndifficulty. Here we have an almost inexcusable instance of the\ndisinclination of the Moors to repairs, for had the stream been swollen,\nthe camp would have been obliged to make a round-about march by the way\nof Hamman-el-Enf, of some thirty miles; and all for the want of an arch\nwhich would scarcely cost a thousand piastres! This stream or river is\nthe same as that which passes near Hamman-el-Enf, and the extensive\nplain through which it meanders is well cultivated, with douwars, or\ncircular villages of the Arabs dotted about. We saw hares, but, the\nground being difficult running for the dogs, we caught but few. Bevies\nof partridges got up, but we were unprepared for them. In the evening,\nthe Bey sent a present of a very fine bay horse to R. Marched about ten\nmiles, and halted at Ben Sayden.\n\nThe following day after starting, we left the line of march to shoot;\nsaw one boar, plenty of foxes and wolves, and we put up another hyaena,\nbut the bag consisted principally of partridges, the red-legged\npartridge or _perdix ruffa_, killed, by the Bey, who is a dead-shot. Our\nride lay among hills; there was very little water, which accounted for\nthe few inhabitants. After dinner, went out shooting near Jebanah, and\nbagged a few partridges, but, not returning before the sun went down,\nthe Bey sent a dozen fellows bawling out our names, fearing some harm\nhad befallen us.\n\nOn leaving the hills, there lay stretched at our feet a boundless plain,\non which is situate Kairwan, extending also to Susa, and leagues around.\nNorth Africa, is a country of hills and plains--such was the case along\nour entire route. We saw a large herd of gazelles feeding, as well as\nseveral single ones, but they have the speed of the greyhound, so we did\nnot grace our supper with any. Saw several birds called Kader, about the\nsize of a partridge, but we shot none. A good many hares and partridges\neither crossed our path or whirred over our heads. Passed over a running\nstream called Zebharah, where we saw the remains of an ancient bridge,\nbut in the place where the baggage went over there was a fine one in\ngood repair. Here was a small dome-topped chapel, called Sidi Farhat, in\nwhich are laid the ashes of a saint. We had seen many such in the hills;\nindeed these gubbah abound all over Barbary, and are placed more\nfrequently on elevations. We noticed particularly the 300 Turkish\ninfantry; they were irregulars with a vengeance, though regulars\ncompared to the Arabs. On overtaking them, they drew up on each side,\nand some dozen of them kept up a running sham fight with their swords\nand small wooden and metal shields before the Bey. The officers kissed\nthe hand of the Bey, and his treasurer tipped their band, for so we must\ncall their tumtums and squeaking-pipes. This ceremony took place every\nmorning, and they were received in the camp with all the honours. They\nkept guard during the night, and did all they could to keep us awake by\ntheir eternal cry of \"Alleya,\" which means, \"Be off,\" or \"Keep your\ndistance!\" These troops had not been recruited for eight years, and will\nsoon die off; and yet we see that the Bey treats these remnants of the\nonce formidable Turkish Tunisian Janissaries with great respect; of\ncourse, in an affair with the Arabs, their fidelity to the Bey would be\nmost unshaken.\n\nAs we journeyed onward, we saw much less vegetation and very little\ncultivation. An immense plain lay before and around us, in which,\nhowever, there was some undulating ground. Passed a good stone bridge;\nwere supplied with water near a large Arab encampment, around which were\nmany droves of camels; turned up several hares, partridges, and\ngazelles. One of the last gave us a good chase, but the greyhounds\ncaught him; in the first half mile, he certainly beat them by a good\nhalf of the instance, but having taken a turn which enabled the dogs to\nmake a short cut, and being blown, they pulled the swift delicate\ncreature savagely down. There were several good courses after hares,\nthough her pursuers gave puss no fair play, firing at her before the\ndogs and heading her in every possible way.\n\nRode to Kairwan. Few Christians arrive in this city. Prince Pueckler\nMuskau was the fourth when he visited it in 1835. The town is clean, but\nmany houses are in ruins. The greater part of a regiment of the Nitham\nare quartered here. The famous mosque, of course, we were not allowed to\nenter, but many of its marble pillars and other ornaments, we heard from\nGiovanni, were the spoils of Christian churches and Pagan temples. The\nhouse of the Kaed was a good specimen of dwellings in this country.\nGoing along a street, we were greatly surprised at seeing our\nattendants, among whom were Si Smyle (a very intelligent and learned\nman, and who taught Mr. R. Arabic during the tour) and the Bash-Boab,\njumping off their horses, and, running up to an old-looking Moor, and\nthen seizing his hand, kissed it; and for some time they would not leave\nthe ragged ruffian-like saint.\n\nAt last, having joined us, they said he was Sidi Amour Abeda, a man of\nexceeding sanctity, and that if the Bey had met the saint, his Highness\nmust have done the same. The saint accompanied us to the Kaed's house;\nand, on entering, we saw the old Kaed himself, who was ill and weeping\non account of the arrival of his son, the commander of a portion of the\nguards of the camp. We went up stairs, and sat down to some sweetmeats\nwhich had been prepared for us, together with Si Smyle and Hamda, but,\nas we were commencing, the saint, who was present, laid hold of the\nsweets with his hands, and blessed them, mumbling _bismillas_ [33] and\nother jargon. We afterwards saw a little house, in course of erection by\norder of the Bey, where the remains of Sidi Amour Abeda are to be\ndeposited at his death, so that the old gentleman can have the pleasure\nof visiting his future burial-place. In this city, a lineal descendant\nof the Prophet, and a lucky guesser in the way of divining, are the\nessential ingredients in the composition of a Moorish saint. Saints of\none order or another are as thick here as ordinary priests in Malta,\nwhom the late facetious Major Wright was accustomed to call\n_crows_--from their black dress--but better, cormorants, as agreeing\nwith their habits of fleecing the poor people. Sidi Amour Abeda's hands\nought to be lily-white, for every one who meets him kisses them with\ndevout and slavering obeisance. The renegade doctor of the Bey told us\nthat the old dervish now in question would like nothing better than to\nsee us English infidels burnt alive. Fanaticism seems to be the native\ngrowth of the human heart!\n\nWe afterwards visited the Jabeah, or well, which they show as a\ncuriosity, as also the camel which turns round the buckets and brings up\nthe water, being all sanctified, like the wells of Mecca, and the\ndrinking of the waters forming an indispensable part of the pilgrimage\nto all holy Mohammedan cities.\n\nWe returned to the Kaed's, and sat down to a capital dinner. The old\nGovernor was a great fanatic, and when R. ran up to shake hands with\nhim, the mamelukes stopped R. for fear he might be insulted. We visited\nthe fortress, which was in course of repair, our _cicerone_ being Sidi\nReschid, an artillery-officer. We then returned to the camp, and found\nSanta Maria, the French officer, had arrived, who, during the tour,\nemployed himself in taking sketches and making scientific observations.\nHe was evidently a French spy on the resources of the Bey. It was given\nout, however, that he was employed to draw charts of Algiers, Tunis, and\nTripoli, by his Government. He endeavoured to make himself as unpopular\nas some persons try to make themselves agreeable, being very jealous of\nus, and every little thing that we had he used to cry for it and beg it\nlike a child, sometimes actually going to the Bey's tent in person, and\nasking his Highness for the things which he saw had been given to us.\n\nWe went to see his Highness administer justice, which he always did,\nmorning and evening, whilst at Kairwan. There were many plaintiffs, but\nno defendants brought up; most of them were turned out in a very summary\nmanner. To some, orders were given, which we supposed enabled them to\nobtain redress; others were referred to the kadys and chiefs. The Bey,\nbeing in want of camels, parties were sent out in search of them, who\ndrove in all the finest that they could find, which were then marked\n(\"taba,\") _a la Bey_, and immediately became the Bey's property. It was\na curious sight to see the poor animals thrown over, and the red-hot\niron put to their legs, amidst the cries and curses of their late\ndifferent owners--all which were not in the least attended to, the wants\nof the Bey, or Government, being superior on such occasions of\nnecessity, or what not, to all complaint, law, or justice. About two\nhundred changed hands in this way.\n\nThe Bey of Tunis has an immense number of camels which he farms out. He\nhas overseers in certain districts, to whom he gives so many camels;\nthese let them out to other persons for mills and agricultural labours,\nat so much per head. The overseers annually render an account of them to\nGovernment, and, when called upon, supply the number required. At this\ntime, owing to a disorder which had caused a great mortality, camels had\nbeen very scarce, and this was the reason of the extensive seizure just\nmentioned. If an Arab commits manslaughter, his tribe is mulcted\nthirty-three camels; and, as the crime is rather common in the Bedouin\ndistricts, the Bey's acquisition in this way is considerable. A few\nyears ago, a Sicilian nobleman exported from Tunis to Sicily some eighty\ncamels, the duty for which the Bey remitted. The camel, if ever so\nhealthy and thriving in the islands of the Mediterranean, could never\nsupersede the labour of mules. The camel is only useful where there are\nvast plains to travel, as in North Africa, Arabia, Persia, Australasia,\nand some parts of the East Indies.\n\nA hundred more Arabs joined, who passed in a single file before the Bey\nfor inspection: they came rushing into the camp by twos and threes,\nfiring off their long guns.\n\nWe crossed large plains, over which ran troops of gazelles, and had many\ngallops after them; but they go much faster than the greyhound, and,\nunless headed and bullied, there is little chance of taking them, except\nfound asleep. On coming on a troop unawares, R. shot one, which the dogs\ncaught. R. went up afterwards to cut its throat _a la Moresque_, when he\nwas insulted by an Arab. R. noticed the fellow, and afterwards told the\nBey, who instantly ordered him to receive two hundred bastinadoes, and\nto be put in chains; but, just as they had begun to whip him, R. went up\nand generously begged him off. This is the end of most bastinados in the\ncountry. We passed a stream which they said had swallowed up some\npersons, and was very dangerous. A muddy stream, they add, is often very\nfatal to travellers. The Bey surprised Captain B. by sending him a\nhandsome black horse as a present; he also sent a grey one to the\nFrenchman, who, when complaining of it, saying that it was a bad one, to\nthe Bey's mamelukes, his Highness sent for it, and gave him another.\nUnder such circumstances, Saint Mary ought to have looked very foolish.\nThe Bey shot a kader, a handsome bird, rather larger than a partridge,\nwith black wings, and flies like a plover. We had a large\nhawking-establishment with us, some twenty birds, very fine falconry,\nwhich sometimes carried off hares, and even attacked young goat-kids.\nMarched to a place called Gilma, near which the road passes through an\nancient town. Shaw says, \"Gilma, the ancient Cilma, or Oppidum\nChilmanenense, is six leagues to the east-south-east of Spaitla. We have\nhere the remains of a large city, with the area of a temple, and some\nother fragments of large buildings. According to the tradition of the\nArabs, this place received its name in consequence of a miracle\npretended to have been wrought by one of their marabouts, in bringing\nhither the river of Spaitla, after it was lost underground. For Ja Elma\nsignifies, in their language, 'The water comes!' an expression we are to\nimagine of surprise at the arrival of the stream.\"\n\nDuring our tour, the mornings were generally cold. We proceeded about\ntwenty miles, and encamped near a place called Wady Tuckah. This river\ncomes from the hills about three or four miles off, and when the camp\narrives at Kairwan, the Bey sends an order to the Arabs of the district\nto let the water run down to the place where the tents are pitched. When\nwe arrived, the water had just come. We saw warrens of hares, and caught\nmany with the dogs. Troops of gazelles were also surprised; one was\nfired at, and went off scampering on three legs. The hawks caught a\nbeautiful bird called hobara, or habary, [34] about the size of the\nsmall hen-turkey, lily white on the back, light brown brindle, tuft of\nlong white feathers on its head, and ruffle of long black feathers,\nwhich they stretch out at pleasure, with a large grey eye. A curious\nprickly plant grows about here, something like a dwarf broom, if its\nleaves were sharp thorns, it is called Kardert. The Bey made R. a\npresent of the hobara.\n\nOne day three gazelles were caught, and also a fox, by R.'s greyhound,\nwhich behaved extremely well, and left the other dogs in the rear, every\nnow and then attacking him in the hind-quarters. Saw seven or eight\nhobaras, but too windy for the hawks to be flown. Captain B. chased a\ngazelle himself, and had the good fortune to catch him. As soon as an\nArab secures an animal, he immediately cuts its throat, repeating\n\"Bismillah, Allah Akbar,\" \"In the name (of God), God is great.\"\n\nWe marched seventeen miles to a place called Aly Ben Own, the name of\nthe saint buried close by. The plain we crossed must have been once\nthickly inhabited, as there were many remains. We were joined by more\nArabs, and our force continued to augment. The Bey, being in want of\nhorses, the same system of seizing them was adopted as with the camels.\n\nOne splendid morning that broke over our encampment we had an\nopportunity of witnessing Africa's most gorgeous scenery. [35] Plenty of\nhobaras; they fly like a goose. The hawks took two or three of them,\nalso some hares. The poor hare does not know what to make of the hawks;\nafter a little running, it gives itself up for death, only first dodging\nout of the bird's pounce, or hiding itself in a tuft of grass or a bush,\nbut which it is not long allowed to do, for the Arabs soon drive it out\nfrom its vain retreat. The hawk, when he seizes the hare with one claw,\ncatches hold of any tuft of grass or irregularity of the ground with the\nother; a strong leather strap is also fastened from one leg to the\nother, to prevent them from being pulled open or strained. We came upon\na herd of small deer, called ebba, which are a little larger than the\ngazelle, but they soon bounded beyond our pursuit, leaving us scarcely\ntime to admire their delicate make and unapproachable speed.\n\nWe crossed a range of hills into another plain, at the extremity of\nwhich lies Ghafsa. The surface was naked, with the exception of tufts of\nstrong, rushy grass, almost a sure indication of hares, and of which we\nstarted a great number. We saw another description of bird, called\nrhaad, [36] with white wings, which flew like a pigeon, but more\nswiftly. Near our tract were the remains of a large tank of ancient\nRoman construction. The Bey shot a fox. Marched fourteen or fifteen\nmiles to Zwaneah, which means \"little garden,\" though there is no sign\nof such thing, unless it be the few oranges, dates, and pomegranates\nwhich they find here. We had water from a tank of modern construction;\nsome remains were close to the camp, the ancient cistern and stone duct\nleading from the hills. We had two thousand camels with the camp and\nfollowing it, for which not a single atom of provender is carried, the\ncamels subsisting scantily upon the coarse grass, weeds or thorns, which\nthe soil barely affords. The camel is very fond of sharp, prickly\nthorns. You look upon the animal, with its apparently most tender mouth,\nchopping the sharpest thorns it can find, full of amazement! Some of the\nchiefs who have lately joined us, have brought their wives with them,\nriding on camels in a sort of palanquin or shut-up machine. These\npalanquins have a kind of mast and shrouds, from which a bell is slung,\ntinkling with the swinging motion of the camel. This rude contrivance\nmakes the camel more than ever \"the ship of the Desert.\" Several fine\nhorses were brought in as presents to the Bey, one a very fine mare.\n\nOur next march was towards Ghafsa, about twenty miles off. We were\njoined by a considerable number of fresh Arabs, who \"played at powder,\"\nand kept firing and galloping before the Bey the whole day; some of them\nmanaged themselves and their arms and horses with great address,\nbalancing the firelock on their heads, firing it, twisting it round,\nthrowing it into the air, and catching it again, and all without once\nlosing the command of their horses. An accident happened amidst the fun;\ntwo of the parties came in contact, and one of them received a dreadful\ngash on the forehead. The dresses of some of them were very rich, and\nlooked very graceful on horseback. A ride over sand-hills brought us in\nview of the town, embedded in olive and date-trees, looking fresh and\ngreen after our hot and dusty march; it lay stretched at the foot of a\nrange of hills, which formed the boundaries of another extensive plain.\n\nWe halted at Ghafsa, [37] which is almost a mass of rubbish filled with\ndirty people, although there are plenty of springs about, principally\nhot and mineral waters. Although the Moors, by their religion, are\nenjoined the constant use of the bath, yet because they do not change\ntheir linen and other clothes, they are always very dirty. They do not,\nhowever, exceed the Maltese and Sicilians, and many other people of the\nneighbourhood, in filth, and perhaps the Moors are cleaner in their\nhahits than they. The Arabs are extremely disgusting, and their women\nare often seen in a cold winter's evening, standing with their legs\nextended over a smoky wood fire, holding up their petticoats, and\ncontinuing in this indelicate position for hours together.\n\nIn these Thermae, or hot, sulphurous, and other mineral springs, is the\nphenomenon of the existence of fish and small snakes. These were\nobserved by our tourists, but I shall give three other authorities\nbesides them. Shaw says: \"'The Ouri-el-Nout,' _i.e_., 'Well of Fish,'\nand the springs of Ghasa and Toser, nourish a number of small fishes of\nthe mullet and perch kind, and are of an easy digestion. Of the like\nquality are the other waters of the Jereed, all of them, after they\nbecome cold, being the common drink of the inhabitants.\" Sir Grenville\nTemple remarks: \"The thermometer in the water marked ninety-five\ndegrees; and, what is curious, a considerable number of fish is found in\nthis stream, which measure from four to six inches in length, and\nresemble, in some degree, the gudgeon, having a delicate flavour. Bruce\nmentions a similar fact, but he says he saw it in the springs of\nFeriana. Part of the ancient structure of these baths still exists, and\npieces of inscriptions are observed in different places.\"\n\nMr. Honneger has made a sketch of this fish. The wood-cut represents it\none half the natural size:\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe snake, not noticed by former tourists, has been observed by Mr.\nHonneger, which nourishes itself entirely upon the fish. The wood-cut\nrepresents the snake half its natural size:\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe fish and the snake live together, though not very amicably, in the\nhot-springs. Prince Puekler Muskau, who travelled in Tunis, narrates\nthat, \"Near the ruins of Utica was a warm spring, in whose almost hot\nwaters we found several turtles, _which seemed to inhabit this basin_.\"\n\nHowever, perhaps, there is no such extraordinary difficulty in the\napprehension of this phenomenon, for \"The Gulf Stream,\" on leaving the\nGulf of Mexico, \"has a temperature of more than 27 deg. (centigrade), or\n80-6/10 degrees of Fahrenheit.\" [38]\n\nMany a fish must pass through and live in this stream. And after all,\nsince water is the element of fish, and is hotter or colder in all\nregions, like the air, the element of man, which he breathes, warmer or\ncooler, according to clime and local circumstances--there appear to be\nno physical objections in the way of giving implicit credence to our\ntourists.\n\nWater is so abundant, that the adjoining plain might be easily\nirrigated, and planted with ten thousand palms and forests of olives.\nGod is bountiful in the Desert, but man wilfully neglects these aqueous\nriches springing up eternally to repair the ravages of the burning\nsimoum! In one of the groves we met a dervish, who immediately set about\ncharming our Boab. He began by an incantation, then seized him round the\nmiddle, and, stooping a little, lifted him on his shoulders, continuing\nthe while the incantation. He then put him on his feet again, and, after\nseveral attempts, appeared to succeed in bringing off his stomach\nsomething in the shape of leaden bullets, which he then, with an air of\nholy swagger, presented to the astonished guard of the Bey. The dervish\nnext spat on his patient's hands, closed them in his own, then smoothed\nhim down the back like a mountebank smooths his pony, and stroked also\nhis head and beard; and, after further gentle and comely ceremonies of\nthis sort, the charming of the charmer finished, and the Boab presented\nthe holy man with his fee. We dined at the Kaed's house; this\nfunctionary was a very venerable man, a perfect picture of a patriarch\nof the olden Scriptural times of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. There was\nnot a single article of furniture in the room, except a humble sofa,\nupon which he sat.\n\nWe inspected the old Kasbah at Ghafsa, which is in nearly a state of\nruin, and looked as if it would soon be down about our ears. It is an\nirregular square, and built chiefly of the remains of ancient edifices.\nIt was guarded by fifty Turks, whose broken-down appearance was in\nperfect harmony with the citadel they inhabited. The square in a\nbuilding is the favourite form of the Moors and Mohammedans generally;\nthe Kaaba of Mecca, the _sanctum sanctorum_, is a square. The Moors\nendeavour to imitate the sacred objects of their religion in every way,\neven in the commonest affairs of human existence, whilst likewise their\ntroops of wives and concubines are only an earthly foretaste and an\nearnest of the celestial ladies they expect to meet hereafter.\n\nWe saw them making oil, which was in a very primitive fashion. The\noil-makers were nearly all women. The olives were first ground between\nstones worked by the hands, until they became of the consistence of\npaste, which was then taken down to the stream and put into a wooden tub\nwith water. On being stirred up, the oil rises to the top, which they\nskim off with their hands and put into skins or jars; when thus skimmed,\nthey pass the grounds or refuse through a sieve, the water running off;\nthe stones and pulp are then saved for firing. But in this way much of\nthe oil is lost, as may be seen by the greasy surface of the water below\nwhere this rude process is going on. Among the oil-women, we noticed a\ngirl who would have been very pretty and fascinating had she washed\nherself instead of the olives. We entered an Arab house inhabited by\nsome twenty persons, chiefly women, who forthwith unceremoniously took\noff our caps, examined very minutely all our clothes with an excited\ncuriosity, laughed heartily when we put our hands in our pockets, and\nwished to do the same, and then pulled our hair, looking under our faces\nwith amorous glances. On the hill overlooking the town, we also met two\nwomen screaming frightfully and tearing their faces; we learned that one\nof them had lost her child. The women make the best blankets here with\nhandlooms, and do the principal heavy work.\n\nWe saw some hobaras, also a bird called getah, smaller than a partridge,\nsomething like a ptarmigan, with its summer feathers, and head shaped\nlike a quail. The Bey sent two live ones to R., besides a couple of\nlarge jerboahs of this part, called here, _gundy_. They are much like\nthe guinea-pig, but of a sandy colour, and very soft and fine, like a\nyoung hare. The jerboahs in the neighbourhood of Tunis are certainly\nmore like the rat. The other day, near the south-west gates, we fell in\nwith a whole colony of them--which, however, were the lesser animal, or\nJerd species--who occupied an entire eminence to themselves, the\nsovereignty of which seemed to have been conceded to them by the Bey of\nTunis. They looked upon us as intruders, and came very near to us, as if\nasking us why we had the audacity to disturb the tranquillity of their\nrepublic. The ground here in many places was covered with a substance\nlike the rime of a frosty morning; it tastes like salt, and from it they\nget nitre. Captain B. thinks it was salt. The water which we drank was\nbrought from Ghafsa: the Bey drinks water brought from Tunis. We marched\nacross a vast plain, covered with the salt just mentioned, which was\ncongealed in shining heaps around bushes or tufts of grass, and among\nwhich also scampered a few hares. We encamped at a place called\nGhorbatah. Close to the camp was a small shallow stream, on each side of\nwhich grew many canes; we bathed in the stream, and felt much refreshed.\nThe evening was pleasantly cool, like a summer evening in England, and\nreminded us of the dear land of our birth. Numerous plains in North\nAfrica are covered with saline and nitrous efflorescence; to the\npresence of these minerals is owing the inexhaustible fertility of the\nsoil, which hardly ever receives any manure, only a little stubble being\noccasionally burnt.\n\nWe saw flights of the getah, and of another bird called the gedur,\nnearly the same, but rather lighter in colour. When they rise from the\nground, they make a curious noise, something like a partridge. We were\nunusually surprised by a flight of locusts, not unlike grasshoppers, of\nabout two inches long, and of a reddish colour. Saw also gazelles.\nHalted by the dry bed of a river, called Furfouwy. A pool supplied the\ncamp: in the mountains, at a distance, there was, however, a delicious\nspring, a stream of liquid pearls in these thirsty lands! A bird called\nmokha appeared now and then; it is about the size of a nightingale, and\nof a white light-brown colour. We seldom heard such sweet notes as this\nbird possesses. Its flying is beautifully novel and curious; it runs on\nthe ground, and now and then stops and rises about fifteen feet from the\nsurface, giving, as it ascends, two or three short slow whistles, when\nit opens its graceful tail and darts down to the ground, uttering\nanother series of melodious whistles, but much quicker than when it\nrises.\n\nWe continued our march over nearly the same sort of country, but all was\nnow flat as far as the eye could see, the hills being left behind us.\nAbout eight miles from Furfouwy, we came to a large patch of date-trees,\nwatered by many springs, but all of them hot. Under the grateful shade\nof the lofty palm were flowers and fruits in commingled sweetness and\nbeauty. Here was the village of Dra-el-Hammah, surrounded, like all the\ntowns of the Jereed, with date-groves and gardens. The houses were most\nhumbly built of mud and bricks. After a scorching march, we encamped\njust beyond, having made only ten miles. Saw quantities of bright soft\nspar, called talc. Here also the ground was covered with a saline\neffloresence. Near us were put up about a dozen blue cranes, the only\nbirds seen to-day. A gazelle was caught, and others chased. We\nparticularly observed huge patches of ground covered with salt, which,\nat a distance, appeared just like water.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nToser.--The Bey's Palace.--Blue Doves.--The town described.--Industry\nof the People.--Sheikh Tahid imprisoned and punished.--Leghorn.--The\nBoo-habeeba.--A Domestic Picture.--The Bey's Diversions.--The Bastinado.--\nConcealed Treasure.--Nefta.--The Two Saints.--Departure of Santa Maria.--\nSnake-charmers.--Wedyen.--Deer Stalking.--Splendid view of the Sahara.--\nRevolting Acts.--Qhortabah.--Ghafsa.--Byrlafee.--Mortality among the\nCamels--Aqueduct.--Remains of Udina.--Arrival at Tunis.--The Boab's\nWives.--Curiosities.--Tribute Collected.--Author takes leave of the\nGovernor of Mogador, and embarks for England.--Rough Weather.--Arrival\nin London.\n\n\nLeaving Dra-el-Hammah, after a hot march of five or six miles, we\narrived at the top of a rising ground, at the base of which was situate\nthe famous Toser, the head-quarters of the camp in the Jereed, and as\nfar as it goes. Behind the city was a forest of date-trees, and beyond\nthese and all around, as far as the eye could wander, was an\nimmeasurable waste--an ocean of sand--a great part of which we could\nhave sworn was water, unless told to the contrary. We were met, before\nentering Toser, with some five or six hundred Arabs, who galloped before\nthe Bey, and fired as usual. The people stared at us Christians with\nopen mouths; our dress apparently astonished them. At Toser, the Bey\nleft his tent and entered his palace, so called in courtesy to his\nHighness, but a large barn of a house, without any pretensions. We had\nalso a room allotted to us in this palace, which was the best to be\nfound in the town, though a small dark affair. Toser is a miserable\nassemblage of mud and brick huts, of very small dimensions, the beams\nand the doors being all of date-wood. The gardens, however, under the\ndate-trees are beautiful, and abundantly watered with copious streams,\nall of which are warm, and in one of which we bathed ourselves and felt\nnew vigour run through our veins. We took a walk in the gardens, and\nwere surprised at the quantities of doves fluttering among the\ndate-trees; they were the common blue or Barbary doves. In the environs\nof Mogador, these doves are the principal birds shot.\n\nToser, or Touzer, the _Tisurus_ of ancient geography, is a considerable\ntown of about six thousand souls, with several villages in its\nneighbourhood.\n\nThe impression of Toser made upon our tourists agrees with that of the\ntraveller, Desfontaines, who writes of it in 1784:--\"The Bey pitched his\ntent on the right side of the city, if such can be called a mass of\n_mud-houses_.\" The description corresponds also with that of Dr. Shaw,\nwho says that \"the villages of the Jereed are built of mud-walls and\nrafters of palm-trees.\" Evidently, however, some improvement has been\nmade of late years. The Arabs of Toser, on the contrary, and which very\nnatural, protested to the French scientific commission that Toser was\nthe finest city in El-Jereed. They pretend that it has an area as large\nas Algiers, surrounded with a mud wall, twelve or fifteen feet high, and\ncrenated. In the centre is a vast open space, which serves for a\nmarket-place. Toser has mosques, schools, Moorish baths--a luxury rare\non the confines of the Desert, fondouks or inns, &c. The houses have\nflat terraces, and are generally well-constructed, the greater part\nbuilt from the ruins of a Roman town; but many are now dilapidated from\nthe common superstitious cause of not repairing or rebuilding old\nhouses. The choice material for building is brick, mostly unbaked or\nsun-dried.\n\nMost of these houses stand detached.\n\nToser, situate in a plain, is commanded from the north-west by a little\nrocky mountain, whence an abundant spring takes its source, called\n_Meshra_, running along the walls of the city southward, divides itself\nafterwards in three branches, waters the gardens, and, after having\nirrigated the plantations of several other villages, loses itself in the\nsand at a short distance. The wells within the city of Toser are\ninsufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, who fetch water\nfrom Wad Meshra. The neighbouring villages are Belad-el-Ader, Zin,\nAbbus; and the sacred villages are Zaouweeat, of Tounseea, Sidi Ali Bou\nLifu, and Taliraouee. The Arabs of the open country, and who deposit\ntheir grain in and trade with these villages, are Oulad Sidi Sheikh,\nOulad Sidi Abeed, and Hammania. The dates of Toser are esteemed of the\nfinest quality.\n\nWalked about the town; several of the inhabitants are very wealthy. The\ndead saints are, however, here, and perhaps everywhere else in Tunis,\nmore decently lodged, and their marabets are real \"whitewashed\nsepulchres.\" They make many burnouses at Toser, and every house presents\nthe industrious sight of the needle or shuttle quickly moving. We tasted\nthe leghma, or \"tears of the date,\" for the first time, and rather liked\nit. On going to shoot doves, we, to our astonishment, put up a snipe.\nThe weather was very hot; went to shoot doves in the cool of the\nevening. The Bey administers justice, morning and evening, whilst in the\nJereed. An Arab made a present of a fine young ostrich to the Bey, which\nhis Highness, after his arrival in Tunis, sent to R. The great man here\nis the Sheikh Tahid, who was imprisoned for not having the tribute ready\nfor the Bey. The tax imposed is equivalent to two bunches for each\ndate-tree. The Sheikh has to collect them, paying a certain yearly sum\nwhen the Bey arrives, a species of farming-out. It was said that he is\nvery rich, and could well find the money. The dates are almost the only\nfood here, and the streets are literally gravelled with their stones.\nSanta Maria again returned his horse to the Bey, and got another in its\nstead. He is certainly a man of _delicate_ feeling. This gentleman\ncarried his impudence so far that he even threatened some of the Bey's\nofficers with the supreme wrath of the French Government, unless they\nattended better to his orders. A new Sheikh was installed, a good thing\nfor the Bey's officers, as many of them got presents on the occasion.\n\nWe blessed our stars that a roof was over our heads to shield us from\nthe burning sun. We blew an ostrich-egg, had the contents cooked, and\nfound it very good eating. They are sold for fourpence each, and it is\npretended that one makes an ample meal for twelve persons. We are\nsupplied with leghma every morning; it tastes not unlike cocoa-nut milk,\nbut with more body and flavour. R. very unwell, attributed it to his\ntaking copious draughts of the leghma. Rode out of an evening; there was\na large encampment of Arabs outside the town, thoroughly sun-burnt,\nhardy-looking fellows, some of them as black as <DW64>s. Many people in\nToser have sore eyes, and several with the loss of one eye, or nearly\nso; opthalmia, indeed, is the most prevalent disease in all Barbary. The\nneighbourhood of the Desert, where the greater part of the year the air\nis filled with hot particles of sand, is very unfavourable to the sight;\nthe dazzling whiteness of the whitewashed houses also greatly injures\nthe eyes. But the Moors pretend that lime-washing is necessary to the\npreservation of the houses from the weather, as well as from filth of\nall sorts. We think really it is useful, by preventing dirty people in\nmany cases from being eaten up by their own filth and vermin,\nparticularly the Jews, the Tunisian Jews being the dirtiest persons in\nthe Regency. The lime-wash is the grand _sanitary_ instrument in North\nAfrica.\n\nThere are little birds that frequent the houses, that might be called\nJereed sparrows, and which the Arabs name boo-habeeba, or \"friend of my\nfather;\" but their dress and language are very different, having reddish\nbreasts, being of a small size, and singing prettily. Shaw mentions them\nunder the name of the Capsa-sparrow, but he is quite wrong in making\nthem as large as the common house-sparrow. He adds: \"It is all over of a\nlark-colour, excepting the breast, which is somewhat lighter, and\nshineth like that of a pigeon. The boo-habeeba has a note infinitely\npreferable to that of the canary, or nightingale.\" He says that all\nattempts to preserve them alive out of the districts of the Jereed have\nfailed. R. has brought several home from that country, which were alive\nwhilst I was in Tunis. There are also many at the Bardo in cages, that\nlive in this way as long as other birds.\n\nWent to see the houses of the inhabitants: they were nearly all the\nsame, the furniture consisting of a burnouse-loom, a couple of\nmillstones, and a quantity of basins, plates, and dishes, hung upon the\nwalls for effect, seldom being used; there were also some skins of\ngrain. The beams across the rooms, which are very high, are hung with\nonions, dates, and pomegranates; the houses are nearly all of one story.\nSome of the women are pretty, with large long black eyes and lashes;\nthey colour the lower lid black, which does not add to their beauty,\nthough it shows the bewitching orb more fully and boldly. They were\nexceedingly dirty and ragged, wearing, nevertheless, a profusion of\near-rings, armlets, anclets, bracelets, and all sorts of _lets_, with a\nthousand talismanic charms hanging from their necks upon their ample\nbosoms, which latter, from the habit of not wearing stays, reach as low\ndown as their waists. They wrap up the children in swaddling-clothes,\nand carry them behind their backs when they go out.\n\nTwo men were bastinadoed for stealing a horse, and not telling where\nthey put him; every morning they were to be flogged until they divulged\ntheir hiding-place.\n\nA man brought in about a foot of horse's skin, on which was the Bey's\nmark, for which he received another horse. This is always done when any\nanimal dies belonging to the Beys, the man in whose hands the animal is,\nreceiving a new one on producing the part of the skin marked. The Bey\nand his ministers and mamelukes amused themselves with shooting at a\nmark. The Bey made some good hits.\n\nThe Bey and his mamelukes also took diversion in spoiling the appearance\nof a very nice young horse; they daubed hieroglyphics upon his shoulders\nand loins, and dyed the back where the saddle is placed, and the three\nlegs below the knee with henna, making the other leg look as white as\npossible. Another grey horse, a very fine one, was also cribbed. We may\nremark here, that there were very few fine horses to be met with, all\nthe animals looking poor and miserable, whilst these few fine ones fell\ninto the hands of the Bey. It is probable, however, that the Arabs kept\ntheir best and most beautiful horses out of the way, while the camp was\nmoving among them.\n\nThe old Sheikh still continued in prison. The bastinadoes with which he\nhad been treated were inflicted on his bare person, cold water being\napplied thereto, which made the punishment more severe. After receiving\none hundred, he said he would shew his hiding-place; and some people\nbeing sent with him, dug a hole where he pointed out, but without coming\nto anything. This was done several times, but with the same effect. He\nwas then locked up in chains till the following morning. Millions of\ndollars lie buried by the Arabs at this moment in different parts of\nBarbary, especially in Morocco, perhaps the half of which will never be\nfound, the owners of them having died before they could point out their\nhoarded treasures to their relatives, as but a single person is usually\nin the secret. Money is in this way buried by tribes, who have nothing\nwhatever to fear from their sovereigns and their sheikhs; they do it\nfrom immemorial custom. It is for this reason the Arabs consider that\nunder all ancient ruins heaps of money are buried, placed there by men\nor demons, who hold the shining hoards under their invincible spell.\nThey cannot comprehend how European tourists can undertake such long\njourneys, merely for the purpose of examining old heaps of stones, and\nmaking plans and pictures of such rubbish. When any person attempts to\nconvince the Arabs that this is the sole object, they only laugh with\nincredulity.\n\nWent to Nefta, a ride of about fourteen miles, lying somewhat nearer the\nSahara than Toser. The country on the right was undulating sand, on the\nleft an apparently boundless ocean, where lies, as a vast sheet of\nliquid fire, when the sun shines on it, the now long celebrated Palus\nLibya. In this so-called lake no water is visible, except a small marsh\nlike the one near Toser, where we went duck-shooting. Our party was very\nrespectable, consisting of the Agha of the Arabs, two or three of the\nBey's mamelukes, the Kaed of the Jereed, whose name is Braun, and fifty\nor sixty Arab guards, besides ourselves. On entering Nefta, the escort\nimmediately entered, according to custom, a marabet (that of Sidi Bou\nAly), Captain B. and R. meanwhile standing outside.\n\nThere were two famous saints here, one of whom was a hundred years of\nage. The other, Sidi Mustapha Azouz, had the character of being a very\nclever and good man, which also his intelligent and benevolent\nappearance betokened, and not a fanatic, like Amour Abeda of Kairwan.\nThere were at the time of our visit to him about two hundred people in\nhis courtyard, who all subsisted on his charities. We were offered\ndates, kouskousou, [39] and a seed which they call sgougou, and which\nhas the appearance of dried apple-seed. The Arabs eat it with honey,\nfirst dipping their fingers into the honey, and then into the seed,\nwhich deliciously sticks to the honey. The Sheikh's saint also\ndistributed beads and rosaries. He gave R. a bag of sgougou-seed, as\nwell as some beads. These two Sheikhs are objects of most religious\nveneration amongst all true believers, and there is nothing which would\nnot be done at their bidding.\n\nNefta, the Negeta of the ancients, is the frontier town of the Tunisian\nterritories from the south, being five days' journey, or about\nthirty-five or forty leagues from the oases of Souf, and fifteen days'\nfrom Ghadumes. Nefta is not so much a town as an agglomeration of\nvillages, separated from one another by gardens, and occupying an extent\nof surface twice the size that of the city of Algiers. These villages\nare Hal Guema, Mesaba, Zebda Ouled, Sherif, Beni Zeid, Beni Ali, Sherfa,\nand Zaouweeah Sidi Ahmed.\n\nThe position of Nefta and its environs is very picturesque. Water is\nhere abundant. The principal source, which, under the name of Wad Nefta,\ntakes its rise at the north of the city, in the midst of a movement of\nearth, enters the villages of Sherfa and Sidi Ahmed; divides them in\ntwo, and fecundates its gardens planted with orange-trees, pomegranates,\nand fig-trees. The same spring, by the means of ducts of earth, waters a\nforest of date-trees which extends some leagues. A regulator of the\nwater (kaed-el-ma) distributes it to each proprietor of the plantation.\n\nThe houses of Nefta are built generally of brick; some with taste and\nluxury; the interior is ornamented with Dutch tiles brought from Tunis.\nEach quarter has its mosque and school, and in the centre of the group\nof villages is a place called Rebot, on the banks of Wad Nefta, which\nserves for a common market. Here are quarters specially devoted to the\naristocratic landed proprietors, and others to the busy merchants. The\nShereefs are the genuine nobles, or seigneurs of Nefta, from among whom\nthe Bey is wont to choose the Governors of the city. The complexion of\nthe population is dark, from its alliance with Negress slaves, like most\ntowns advanced in the Desert. The manners of the people are pure. They\nare strict observers of the law, and very hospitable to strangers.\nCaptain B., however, thought that, had he not been under the protection\nof the Bey, his head would not have been worth much in these districts.\nEvery traveller almost forms a different opinion, and frequently the\nvery opposite estimate, respecting the strangers amongst whom he is\nsojourning. A few Jewish artizans have always been tolerated here, on\ncondition of wearing a black handkerchief round their heads, and not\nmount a horse, &c. Recently the Bey, however, by solemn decrees, has\nplaced the Jews exactly on the same footing of rights and privileges as\nthe rest of his subjects.\n\nNefta is the intermediate _entrepot_ of commerce which Tunis pours\ntowards the Sahara, and for this reason is called by the Arabs, \"the\ngate of Tunis;\" but the restrictive system established by the Turks\nduring late years at Ghadumes, has greatly damaged the trade between the\nJereed and the Desert. The movement of the markets and caravans takes\nplace at the beginning of spring, and at the end of summer. Only a\nportion of the inhabitants is devoted to commerce, the rich landed\nproprietory and the Shereefs representing the aristocracy, lead the\ntranquil life of nobles, the most void of care, and, perhaps, the\nhappiest of which contemplative philosophy ever dreamed. The oasis of\nNefta, indeed, is said to be the most poetic of the Desert; its gardens\nare delicious; its oranges and lemons sweet; its dates the finest fruit\nin the \"land of dates.\" Nearly all the women are pretty, of that beauty\npeculiar to the Oriental race; and the ladies who do not expose\nthemselves to the fierce sun of the day, are as fair as Mooresses.\n\nSanta Maria left for Ghabs, to which place there is not a correct route\nlaid down in any chart. There are three routes, but the wells of one are\nonly known to travellers, a knowledge which cannot be dispensed with in\nthese dry regions. The wells of the other two routes are known to the\nbordering tribes alone, who, when they have taken a supply of water,\ncover them up with sand, previously laying a camel-skin over the\nwell-mouth, to prevent the sand falling into the water, so that, while\ndying with thirst, you might be standing on a well and be none the\nwiser. The Frenchman has taken with him an escort of twelve men. The\nweather is cooler, with a great deal of wind, raising and darkening the\nsky with sand; even among the dategroves our eyes and noses were like so\nmany sand-quarries.\n\nSheikh Tahib has been twice subjected to corporal punishment in the same\nway as before mentioned, with the addition of fifty, but they cannot\nmake him bleed as they wish. He declares he has not got the money, and\nthat he cannot pay them, though they cut him to pieces. As he has\ncollected a great portion of the tribute of the people, one cannot much\npity the lying rogue.\n\nWe were amused with the snake-charmers. These gentry are a company under\nthe protection of their great saint Sidi Aysa, who has long gone\nupwards, but also is now profitably employed in helping the juggling of\nthese snake-mountebanks. These fellows take their snakes about in small\nbags or boxes, which are perfectly harmless, their teeth and poison-bags\nbeing extracted. They carry them in their bosoms, put them in their\nmouths, stuffing a long one in of some feet in length, twist them around\ntheir arms, use them as a whip to frighten the people, in the meanwhile\nscreaming out and crying unto their Heavenly protector for help, the\nbystanders devoutly joining in their prayers. The snake-charmers usually\nperform other tricks, such as swallowing nails and sticking an iron bar\nin their eyes; and they wear their hair long like women, which gives\nthem a very wild maniacal look.\n\nThree of the mamelukes and ourselves went to Wedyen, a town and\ndate-wood about eight miles from Toser, to the left. The date-grove is\nextensive, and there are seven villages in it of the same name. We slept\nin the house of the Sheikh, who complained that the Frenchman, in\npassing that way, had allowed his escort to plunder, and actually bound\nthe poor Sheikh, threatening him on his remonstrating. What conduct for\nChristians to teach these people!\n\nOne morning before daylight, we were on horseback, and _en route_\ntowards the hills, for the purpose of shooting loted, as they call a\nspecies of deer found here. The ground in the neighbourhood of Wedyen is\ntossed about like a hay-field, and volcanic looking. About four miles\noff we struck into the rocks, on each side of our path, rising\nperpendicularly in fantastic shapes. On reaching the highest ground, the\nview was exceedingly wild. Much of the rock appeared as if it had only\njust been cooled from a state of fusion; there was also a quantity of\ntuffo rock, similar to that in the neighbourhood of Naples. The first\nanimal we saw was a wolf, which, standing on the sky-line of the\nopposite hill, looked gigantic. The deep valley between, however,\nprevented our nearer approach.\n\nWe soon after came on a loted, who took to his heels, turning round a\nmass of rock; but, soon after, he almost met as, and we had a view of\nhim within forty yards. Several shots were fired at him without effect,\nand he at last made his escape, with a speed which defied all our\nattempts at following him. Dismounting, the Sheikh Ali, of the Arab\ntribe Hammama, who was with us, and who is the greatest deer-stalker in\nthe country, preceded us a little distance to look out for deer, the\nmarks of which were here very numerous. After a short time, an Arab\nbrought information of a herd of some thirty, with a good many young\nones; but our endeavours to have a shot at them were fruitless, though\none of the Arabs got near enough to loose the dogs at them, and a\ngreyhound was kicked over for his pains. We saw no more of them; but our\nwant of success was not surprising, silence not being in the least\nattended to, and our party was far too large. The Arabs have such a\nhorrible habit of vociferation, that it is a wonder they ever take any\ngame at all. About the hills was scattered a great variety of aromatic\nplants, quantities of shells, and whole oyster-beds, looking almost as\nfresh as if they had been found by the sea-side.\n\nOn our return from Toser, we had an extensive view of the Sahara, an\nocean as far as the eye could see, of what one would have taken his oath\nwas water, the shores, inlets, and bays being clearly defined, but, in\nreality, nothing but salt scattered on the surface. Several islets were\napparently breaking its watery expanse, but these also were only heaps\nof sand raised from the surrounding flat. The whole country, hills,\nplains and deserts, gave us an idea as if the materials had been thrown\ntogether for manufacture, and had never been completed. Nevertheless\nthese savage deserts of boundless extent are as complete in their kind\nas the smiling meadows and fertile corn-fields of England, each being\nperfect in itself, necessary to the grand whole of creation, and forming\nan essential portion of the works of Divine Providence.\n\nThe Sheikh Tahib's gardens were sold for 15,000 piastres, his wife also\nadded to this 1,000, and he was set at liberty. The dates have been\ncoming in to a great amount. There are many different kinds. The\nprincipal are:--Degalah, the most esteemed, which are very sweet and\nalmost transparent. Captain B. preferred the Trungah, another first-rate\nsort, which are plum-shaped, and taste something like a plum. There are\nalso the Monachah, which are larger than the other two, dryer and more\nmealy, and not so sweet as Degalah, and other sorts. The dates were very\nfine, though in no very great abundance, the superior state of ripeness\nbeing attributed to there only being a single day of rain during the\npast year in the Jereed. Rain is bad for the dates, but the roots of the\ntree cannot have too much water.\n\nThe tent-pitchers of the camp went round and performed, in mask, actions\nof the most revolting description, some being dressed as women, and\ndancing in the most lascivious and indecent manner. One fellow went up\nto R., who was just on the point of knocking him down, when, seeing the\nTreasurer of the Bey cracking his sides with laughter, he allowed the\nbrute to go off under such high patronage. It was even said that these\nfellows were patronized by his Highness. But, on all Moorish feastdays,\nlascivious actions of men and women are an indispensable part of their\nentertainment. This is the worst side of the character of the Moors. The\nMoorish women were never so profligate as since the arrival of the\nFrench in Algeria.\n\nOne of the greatest chiefs, Sultan Kaed, of the Hammama has just died.\nHe was an extremely old man, and it is certain that people live to a\ngood old age in this burning clime. During his life, he had often\ndistinguished himself, and lastly against the French, before\nConstantina. Whilst in the hills one day, we came suddenly upon a set of\nArabs, about nine in number, who took to their heels on seeing us. A man\nhas just been killed near this place, probably by the same gang. For\nrobbery and murder, no hills could be better fitted, the passes being so\nintricate, and the winds and turns so sudden and sharp. The Sheikh Ali\nbrought in two loteds, a female and its young one, which he had shot.\nThe head of the loted is like a deer's, but the eye is further up: it is\nabout a fallowdeer's size. The female has not the beard like a goat, but\nlong hair, reaching from the head to the bottom of the chest, and over\nthe fore-legs. These loteds were taken in consequence of an order from\nthe Bey, that they should not return without some.\n\nOn our march back to Tunis, we encamped for two days by the foot of a\nrange of hills at Sheesheeah, about ten miles off. The water, brought\nfrom some distance, was bad and salt.\n\nWe proceeded to Ghortabah, our old place. Two of the prisoners (about\ntwelve of whom we had with us), and one of the Turks, died from the\nexcessive heat. The two couriers that were sent with despatches for the\nGovernment were attacked near this place by the Arabs, and the horse of\none was so injured, that it was necessary to kill him; the man who rode\nthe horse was also shot through the leg. This was probably in revenge\nfor the exactions of the Bey of the Camp on the tribes.\n\nOn our return to Ghafsa, we had rain, hail, and high wind, and\nexceedingly cold--a Siberian winter's day on the verge of the scorching\ndesert. The ground, where there was clay, very slippery; the camels\nreeled about as if intoxicated. The consequence was, it was long before\nthe tents came up, and we endured much from this sudden change of the\nweather. Our sufferings were, however, nothing as compared to others,\nfor during the day, ten men were brought in dead, from the cold (three\ndied four days before from heat), principally Turks; and, had there been\nno change in the temperature, we cannot tell how many would have shared\nthe same fate. Many of the camels, struggling against the clayey soil,\ncould not come up.\n\nEight more men were shortly buried, and three were missing. The sudden\ntransition from the intense heat of the one day to the freezing cold of\nthe next, probably gave the latter a treble power, producing these\ndisastrous effects, the poor people being sadly ill-clad, and quite\nunprepared for such extreme rigour. Besides, on our arrival at the camp,\nall the money in Europe could not have purchased us the required\ncomforts, or rather necessaries, to preserve our health. Cold makes\neverybody very selfish. We were exceedingly touched on hearing of the\ndeath of a little girl, whom we saw driven out of a kitchen, in which\nthe poor helpless little thing had taken refuge from the inclemency of\nthe weather.\n\nSanta Maria arrived from Ghabs without accident, having scarcely seen a\nsoul the whole of the way. He certainly was an enterprizing fellow,\nworthy of imitation. He calculated the distance from Ghabs to Toser at\n200 miles. There are a number of towns in the districts of Ghabs better\nbuilt than those of Nefta and Toser; Ghabs river is also full of water\nand the soil of the country is very fertile. The dates are not so good\nas those of the Jereed. Ghabs is about 130 miles from Ghafsa. We here\ntook our farewell of Santa Maria; he went to Beja, the head-quarters of\nthe summer-camp: thence, of course, he would proceed to Algiers, to give\nan account of his _espionage_. Next season, he said, he would go to\nTripoli and Ghadames; he had been many years in North Africa, and spoke\nArabic fluently.\n\nWe next marched to Byrlafee, about twenty miles, and ninety-one from\nToser, where there are the ruins of an old town. The weather continued\ncold and most wintry. Here is a very ancient well still in use.\nFragments of cornices and pillars are strewn about. The foundations of\nhouses, and some massive stone towers, which from their having a pipe up\nthe centre, must have had something to do with regulating the water, are\nall that remain.\n\nWe had now much wind, but no rain. A great many camels and horses\nperished. Altogether, the number of camels that died on the return of\nthe camp, was 550. The price of a camel varies from 60 to 200 piastres.\nMany good ones were sold at the camp for eighty piastres each, or about\ntwo pounds ten shillings, English money. A good sheep was disposed of\nfor four or five piastres, or about three shillings. There were also\nsome ludicrous sales. A horse in the extremities of nature, or near to\nthe _articulo mortis_, was sold for a piastre, eight pence; a camel, in\na like situation, was sold for a piastre and a half. A tolerably good\nhorse in Tunis sells at from 800 to 1000 piastres.\n\nThere are the remains of an aqueduct at Gilma, and several other\nbuildings, the capitals of the pillars being elaborately worked. It is\nseen that nearly the entire surface of Tunis is covered with remains of\naqueducts, Roman, Christian, and Moorish. If railways be applied to this\ncountry--the French, are already talking about forming one from Algiers\nto Blidah, across the Mitidjah--unquestionably along the lines will be\nconstructed ducts for water, which could thus be distributed over the\nwhole country. Instead of the camels of the \"Bey of the Camp\" carrying\nwater from Tunis to the Jereed, the railway would take from Zazwan, the\nbest and most delicious water in the Regency, to the dry deserts of the\nJereed, with the greatest facility. As to railways paying in this\ncountry, the resources of Tunis, if developed, could pay anything.\n\nMarching onwards about eighteen miles, we encamped two or three beyond\nan old place called Sidi-Ben-Habeeba. A man murdered a woman from\njealousy in the camp, but made his escape. Almost every eminence we\npassed was occupied with the remains of some ancient fort, or temple.\nThere was a good deal of corn in small detached patches, but it must be\nremembered, the north-western provinces are the corn-districts.\n\nIn the course of the following three days, we reached Sidi-Mahammedeah,\nwhere are the magnificent remains of Udina. After about an hour's halt,\nand when all the tents had been comfortably pitched, the Bey astonished\nus with an order to continue our march, and we pursued our way to\nMomakeeah, about thirty miles, which we did not reach until after dark.\nWe passed, for some three or four hours, through a flight of locusts,\nthe air being darkened, and the ground loaded with them. At a little\ndistance, a flight of locusts has the appearance of a heavy snow-storm.\nThese insects rarely visit the capital; but, since the appearance of\nthose near Momakeeah, they have been collected in the neighbourhood of\nthe city, cooked, and sold among the people. Momakeeah is a countryhouse\nbelonging to the Bey, to whom, also, belongs a great portion of the land\naround. There is a large garden, laid out in the Italian style attached\nto this country-seat.\n\nOn arriving at Tunis, we called at the Bardo as we passed, and saw the\nguard mounting. There was rather a fine band of military music; Moorish\nmusicians, but playing, after the European style, Italian and Moorish\nairs.\n\nWe must give here some account of our Boab's domestic concerns. He\nboasted that he had had twenty-seven wives, his religion allowing four\nat once, which he had bad several times; he was himself of somewhat\nadvanced years. According to him, if a man quarrels with his wife, he\ncan put her in prison, but must, at the same time, support her. A\ncertain quantity of provision is laid down by law, and he must give her\ntwo suits, or changes, of clothes a year. But he must also visit her\nonce a week, and the day fixed is Friday. If the wife wishes to be\nseparated, and to return to her parents, she must first pay the money\nwhich he may demand, and must also have his permission, although he\nhimself may send her to her parents whenever he chooses, without\nassigning any reason. He retains the children, and he may marry again.\nThe woman is generally expected to bring her husband a considerable sum\nin the way of dowry, but, on separation, she gets nothing back. This was\nthe Boab's account, but I think he has overdone the harshness and\ninjustice of the Mohammedan law of marriage in relating it to our\ntourists. It may be observed that the strict law is rarely acted upon,\nand many respectable Moors have told me that they have but one wife, and\nfind that quite enough. It is true that many Moors, especially learned\nmen, divorce their wives when they get old, feeling the women an\nembarrassment to them, and no wonder, when we consider these poor\ncreatures have no education, and, in their old age, neither afford\nconnubial pleasure nor society to their husbands. With respect to\ndivorce, a woman can demand by law and right to be separated from her\nhusband, or divorced, whenever he ill-treats her, or estranges himself\nfrom her. Eunuchs, who have the charge of the women, are allowed to\nmarry, although they cannot have any family. The chief eunuch of the\nBardo has the most revolting countenance.\n\nOur tourists brought home a variety of curious Jereed things: small\ndate-baskets full of dates, woollen articles, skins of all sorts, and a\nfew live animals. Sidi Mohammed also made them many handsome presents.\nSome deer, Jereed goats, an ostrich, &c., were sent to Mr. R. after his\nreturn, and both Captain B. and Mr. R. have had every reason to be\nextremely gratified with the hospitality and kind attentions of the \"Bey\nof the Camp.\"\n\nIt is very difficult to ascertain the amount of tribute collected in the\nJereed, some of which, however, was not got in, owing to various\nimpediments. Our tourists say generally:--\n\n  Camel-loads. [40]\n  Money, dollars, and piastres, (chiefly I\n  imagine, the latter.)                             23\n\n  Burnouses, blankets, and quilts, &c.               6\n\n  Dates (these were collected at Toser,\n    and brought from Nefta and the surrounding\n    districts)                                     500\n                                                  ----\n                 Total                             529\n\n  It is impossible, with this statement\n    before us, to make out any exact\n    calculation of the amount of tribute.\n    A cantar of dates varies from fifteen\n    to twenty-five shillings, say on an\n    average a pound sterling; this will\n    make the amount of the 500 camel-loads\n    at five cantars per load                    L2,500\n\n  Six camel-loads of woollen manufactures,\n    &c., at sixty pound per load, value            360\n                                                ------\n                   Total                        L2,860\n\nThe money, chiefly piastres, must be left to conjecture. However, Mr.\nLevy, a large merchant at Tunis, thinks the amount might be from 150 to\n200,000 piastres, or, taking the largest sum, L6,250 sterling:\n\n  Total amount of the tribute of the Jereed:\n  in goods                                      L2,860\n  Ditto, in money:                               6,250\n                                                ------\n                   Total                        L9,110\n\nTo this sum may be added the smaller presents of horses, camels, and\nother beasts of burden.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore leaving Mogador, in company with Mr. Willshire, I saw his\nExcellency, the Governor again, when I took formal leave of him. He\naccompanied me down to the port with several of the authorities, waiting\nuntil I embarked for the Renshaw schooner. Several of the Consuls, and\nnearly all the Europeans, were also present. On the whole, I was\nsatisfied with the civilities of the Moorish authorities, and offer my\ncordial thanks to the Europeans of Mogador for their attentions during\nmy residence in that city.\n\nA little circumstance shews the subjection of our merchants, the Consul\nnot excepted, to the Moorish Government. One of the merchants wished to\naccompany me on board, but was not permitted, on account of his\nengagements with the Sultan.\n\nA merchant cannot even go off the harbour to superintend the stowing of\nhis goods. Never were prisoners of war, or political offenders, so\nclosely watched as the boasted imperial merchants of this city.\n\nAfter setting sail, we were soon out of sight of Mogador; and, on the\nfollowing day, land disappeared altogether. During the next month, we\nwere at sea, and out of view of the shore. I find an entry in my\njournal, when off the Isle of Wight. We had had most tremendous weather,\nsuccessive gales of foul wind, from north and north-east. Our schooner\nwas a beautiful vessel, a fine sailer with a flat bottom, drawing little\nwater, made purposely for Barbary ports. She had her bows completely\nunder water, and pitched her way for twenty-five succeeding days,\nthrough huge rising waves of sea and foam. During the whole of this\ntime, I never got up, and lived on bread and water with a little\nbiscuit. Captain Taylor, who was a capital seaman, and took the most\naccurate observations, lost all patience, and, though a good methodist,\nwould now and then rush on deck, and swear at the perverse gale and\nwrathful sea. We took on board a fine barb for Mr. Elton, which died\nafter a few days at sea, in these tempests. I had a young vulture that\ndied a day before the horse, or we should have fed him on the carcase.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAn aoudad which we conveyed on account of Mr. Willshire to London, for\nthe Zoological Society, outlived these violent gales, and was safely and\ncomfortably lodged in the Regent's Park. After my return from Africa, I\npaid my brave and hardy fellow-passenger a visit, and find the air of\nsmoky London agrees with him as well as the cloudless region of the\nMorocco Desert.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\n\nThe following account of the bombardment of Mogador by the French,\nwritten at the period by an English Resident may be of interest at the\npresent time.\n\nMogador was bombarded on the 13th of August, 1844. Hostilities began at\n9 o'clock A.M., by the Moors firing twenty-one guns before the French\nhad taken up their position, but the fire was not returned until 2 P.M.\nThe 'Gemappes,' 100; 'Suffren,' 99; 'Triton,' 80; ships of the line.\n'Belle Poule,' 60, frigate; 'Asmodee' and 'Pluton,' steamers, and some\nbrigs, constituted the bombarding squadron. The batteries were silenced,\nand the Moorish authorities with many of the inhabitants fled, leaving\nthe city unprotected against the wild tribes, who this evening and the\nnext morning, sacked and fired the city. On the 16th, nine hundred\nFrench were landed on the isle of Mogador. After a rude encounter with\nthe garrison, they took possession of it and its forts. Their loss was,\nafter twenty-eight hours' bombarding, trifling, some twenty killed and\nas many more wounded; the Moors lost some five hundred on the isle\nkilled, besides the casualties in the city.\n\nThe British Consul and his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Robertson, with\nothers, were obliged to remain in the town during the bombardment on\naccount of their liabilities to the Emperor. The escape of these people\nfrom destruction was most miraculous.\n\nThe bombarding squadron reached on the 10th, the English frigate,\n'Warspite,' on the 13th, and the wind blowing strong from N.E., and\npreventing the commencement of hostilities, afforded opportunity to\nsave, if possible, the British Consul's family and other detained\nEuropeans; but, notwithstanding the strenuous remonstrances of the\ncaptain of the 'Warspite', nothing whatever could prevail upon the\nMoorish Deputy-Governor in command, Sidi Abdallah Deleero, to allow the\nBritish and other Europeans to take their departure. The Governor even\nperemptorily refused permission for the wife of the Consul to leave,\nupon the cruel sophism that, \"The Christian religion asserts the husband\nand wife to be one, consequently,\" added the Governor, \"as it is my\nduty, which I owe to my Emperor, to prevent the Consul from leaving\nMogador, I must also keep his wife.\"\n\nThe fact is the Moors, in their stupidity, and perhaps in their revenge,\nthought the retaining of the British Consul and the Europeans might, in\nsome way or other, contribute to the defence of themselves, save the\ncity, or mitigate the havoc of the bombardment. At any rate, they would\nsay, \"Let the Christians share the same fate and dangers as ourselves.\"\nDuring the bombardment, the Moors for two hours fought well, but their\nbest gunner, a Spanish renegade, Omar Ei-Haj, being killed, they became\ndispirited and abandoned the batteries. The Governor and his troops,\nabout sunset, disgracefully and precipitately fled, followed by nearly\nall the Moorish population, thereby abandoning Mogador to pillage, and\nthe European Jews to the merciless wild tribes, who, though levied to\ndefend the town, had, for some hours past, hovered round it like droves\nof famished wolves.\n\nAs the Governor fled out, terrified as much at the wild tribes as of the\nFrench, in rushed these hordes, led on by their desperate chiefs. These\nwretches undismayed, unmoved by the terrors of the bombarding ravages\naround, strove and vied with each other in the committal of every act of\nthe most unlicensed ferocity and depredation, breaking open houses,\nassaulting the inmates, murdering such as shewed resistance, denuding\nthe more submissive of their clothing, abusing women--particularly in\nthe Jewish quarter--to all which atrocities the Europeans were likewise\nexposed.\n\nAt the most imminent hazard of their lives, the British Consul and his\nwife, with a few others, escaped from these ruffians. Truly providential\nwas their flight through streets, resounding with the most turbulent\nconfusion and sanguinary violence. It was late when the plunderers\nappeared before the Consulates, where, without any ceremony, by\nhundreds, they fell to work, breaking open bales of goods, ransacking\nplaces for money and other treasures; and, thus unsatisfied in their\nrapacity, they tore and burnt all the account-books and Consular\ndocuments.\n\nOther gangs fought over the spoil; some carrying off their booty, and\nothers setting it on fire. It was a real pandemonium of discord and\nlicentiousness. During the darkness, and in the midst of such scenes, it\nwas that the Consul and his wife threaded their precarious flight\nthrough the streets, and in their way were intercepted by a marauding\nband, who attacked them; tore off his coat; and, seizing his wife,\ninsisted upon denuding her, four or five daggers being raised to her\nthroat, expecting to find money concealed about their persons; nor would\nthe ruffians desist until they ascertained they had none, the Consul\nhaving prudently resolved to take no money with them. Fortunately, at\nthis juncture, his wife was able to speak, and in Arabic (being born\nhere, and daughter of a former Consul), therefore she could give force\nto her entreaties by appealing to them not to imbue their hands in the\nblood of their countrywomen. This had the desired effect. The chief of\nthe party undertook to conduct them to the water-port, when, coming in\ncontact with another party, a conflict about booty ensued, during which\nthe Consul's family got out of the town to a place of comparative\nsecurity.\n\nIncidents of a similar alarming nature attended the escape of Mr.\nRobertson, his wife, and four children; one, a baby in arms. In the\ncrowd, Mr. Robertson, with a child in each hand, lost sight of Mrs.\nRobertson, with her infant and another child. Distracted by sad\nforebodings, poor Mr. Robertson forced his way to the water-port, but\nnot before a savage mountainer--riding furiously by him--aimed a\nsabre-blow at him to cut him down; but, as the murderous arm was poised\nabove, Mr. Robertson stooped, and, raising his arm at the time, warded\nit off; the miscreant then rode off, being satisfied at this cut at the\ndetested Nazarene.\n\nAnother ruffian seized one of his little girls, a pretty child of nine\nyears old, and scratched her arm several times with his dagger, calling\nout _flous_ (money) at each stroke. At the water-port, Mr. Robertson\njoined his fainting wife, and the British Consul and his wife, with Mr.\nLucas and Mr. Allnut. An old Moor never deserted the Consul's family,\n\"faithful among the faithless;\" and a Jewess, much attached to the\nfamily, abandoned them only to return to those allied to her by the ties\nof blood.\n\nTheir situation was now still perilous, for, should they be discovered\nby the wild Berbers, they all might be murdered. This night, the 15th,\nwas a most anxious one, and their apprehensions were dreadful. Dawn of\nday was fast approaching, and every hour's delay rendered their\ncondition more precarious. In this emergency, Mr. Lucas, who never once\nfailed or lost his accustomed suavity and presence of mind amidst these\nimminent dangers, resolved upon communicating with the fleet by a most\nhazardous experiment. On his way from the town-gate to the water-port,\nhe noticed some deal planks near the beach. The idea struck him of\nturning these into a raft, which, supporting him, could enable their\nparty to communicate with the squadron. Mr. Lucas fetched the planks,\nand resolutely set to work. Taking three of them, and luckily finding a\nquantity of strong grass cordage, he arranged them in the water, and\nwith some cross-pieces, bound the whole together; and, besides, having\nfound two small pieces of board to serve him as paddles, he gallantly\nlaunched forth alone, and, in about an hour, effected his object, for he\nexcited the attention of the French brig, 'Canard,' from which a boat\ncame and took him on board.\n\nThe officers, being assured there were no Moors on guard at the\nbatteries, and that the Berbers were wholly occupied in plundering the\ncity, promptly and generously sent off a boat with Mr. Lucas to the\nrescue of the alarmed and trembling fugitives. The Prince de Joinville\nafterwards ordered them to be conveyed on board the 'Warspite.' The\nself-devotedness, sagacity, and indefatigable exertions of the excellent\nyoung man, Mr. Lucas, were above all encomiums, and, at the hands of the\nBritish Government, he deserved some especial mark of favour.\n\nPoor Mrs. Levy (an English Jewess, married to a Maroquine Jew), and her\nfamily were left behind, and accompanied the rest of the miserable Jews\nand natives, to be maltreated, stripped naked, and, perhaps, murdered,\nlike many poor Jews. Mr. Amrem Elmelek, the greatest native merchant and\na Jew, died from fright. Carlos Bolelli, a Roman, perished during the\nsack of the city.\n\nMogador was left a heap of ruins, scarcely one house standing entire,\nand all tenantless. In the fine elegiac bulletin of the bombarding\nPrince, \"Alas! for thee, Mogador! thy walls are riddled with bullets,\nand thy mosques of prayer blackened with fire!\" (or something like\nthese words.)\n\n\nCOMMERCE WITH MOROCCO.\n\nTANGIER.\n\nTangier trades almost exclusively with Gibraltar, between which place\nand this, an active intercourse is constantly kept up.\n\nThe principal articles of importation into Tangier are, cotton goods of\nall kinds, cloth, silk-stuffs, velvets, copper, iron, steel, and\nhardware of every description; cochineal, indigo, and other dyes; tea,\ncoffee, sulphur, paper, planks, looking-glasses, tin, thread,\nglass-beads, alum, playing-cards, incense, sarsaparilla, and rum.\n\nThe exports consist in hides, wax, wool, leeches, dates, almonds,\noranges, and other fruit, bark, flax, durra, chick-peas, bird-seed, oxen\nand sheep, henna, and other dyes, woollen sashes, haicks, Moorish\nslippers, poultry, eggs, flour, &c.\n\nThe value of British and foreign goods imported into Tangier in 1856\nwas: British goods, L101,773 6_s_., foreign goods, L33,793.\n\nThe goods exported from Tangier during the same year was: For British\nports, L63,580 10_s_., for foreign ports, L13,683.\n\nThe following is a statement of the number of British and foreign ships\nthat entered and cleared from this port during the same year. Entered:\nBritish ships 203, the united tonnage of which was 10,883; foreign ships\n110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.\n\nCleared: British ships 207, the united tonnage of which was 10,934;\nforeign ships 110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.\n\nThree thousand head of cattle are annually exported, at a fixed duty of\nfive dollars per head, to Gibraltar, for the use of that garrison, in\nconformity with the terms of special grants that have, from time to\ntime, been made by the present Sultan and some of his predecessors. In\naddition to the above, about 2,000 head are, likewise, exported\nannually, for the same destination, at a higher rate of duty, varying\nfrom eight dollars to ten dollars per head. Gibraltar, also, draws from\nthis place large supplies of poultry, eggs, flour, and other kinds of\nprovisions.\n\nMOGADOR.\n\nFrom the port of Mogador are exported the richest articles the country\nproduces, viz., almonds, sweet and bitter gums, wool, olive-oil, seeds\nof various kinds, as cummin, gingelen, aniseed; sheep-skins, calf, and\ngoat-skins, ostrich-feathers, and occasionally maize.\n\nThe amount of exports in 1855 was: For British ports, L228,112 3_s_.\n2_d_., for foreign ports, L55,965 13_s_. 1_d_.\n\nThe imports are Manchester cotton goods, which have entirely superseded\nthe East India long cloths, formerly in universal use, blue salampores,\nprints, sugar, tea, coffee, Buenos Ayres slides, iron, steel, spices,\ndrugs, nails, beads and deals, woollen cloth, cotton wool, and mirrors\nof small value, partly for consumption in the town, but chiefly for that\nof the interior, from Morocco and its environs, as far as Timbuctoo.\n\nThe amount of imports in 1855 was: British goods, L136,496 7_s_. 6_d_.,\nforeign goods L31,222 11_s_. 5_d_.\n\nThe trade last year was greatly increased by the unusually large demand\nfor olive-oil from all parts, and there is no doubt that, under a more\nliberal Government, the commerce might be developed to a vast extent.\n\nRABAT.\n\nThe principal goods imported at Rabat are, alum, calico of different\nqualities, cinnamon, fine cloth, army cloth, cloves, copperas, cotton\nprints, raw cotton, sewing cotton, cutlery, dimity, domestics,\nearthenware, ginger, glass, handkerchiefs (silk and cotton), hardware,\nindigo, iron, linen, madder root, muslin, sugar (refined and raw), tea,\nand tin plate.\n\nThe before-mentioned articles are imported partly for consumption in\nRabat and Sallee, and partly for transmission into the interior.\n\nThe value of different articles of produce exported at Rabat during the\nlast five years amounts to L34,860 1_s_.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the imports and exports at Rabat would\ngreatly increase, if the present high duties were reduced, and\nGovernment monopolies abolished. Large quantities of hides were exported\nbefore they were a Government monopoly: now the quantity exported is\nvery inconsiderable.\n\nMAZAGAN.\n\n_Goods Imported_.--Brown Domestics, called American White, muslins, raw\ncotton, cotton-bales, silk and cotton pocket-handkerchiefs; tea, coffee,\nsugars, iron, copperas, alum; many other articles imported, but in very\nsmall quantities.\n\nA small portion of the importations is consumed at Mazagan and Azimore,\nbut the major portions in the interior.\n\nThe amount of the leading goods exported in 1855 was:--Bales of wool,\n6,410; almonds, 200 serons; grain, 642,930 fanegas.\n\nNo doubt the commerce of this port would be increased under better\nfiscal laws than those now established.\n\nBut the primary and immediate thing to be looked after is the wilful\ncasting into the anchorage-ground of stone-ballast by foreigners.\nBritish masters are under control, but foreigners will persist, chiefly\nSardinian masters.\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n[1] The predecessor of Muley Abd Errahman.\n\n[2] On account, of their once possessing the throne, the Shereefs have a\npeculiar jealousy of Marabouts, and which latter have not forgotten\ntheir once being sovereigns of Morocco. The _Moravedi_ were \"really a\ndynasty of priests,\" as the celebrated Magi, who usurped the throne of\nCyrus. The Shereefs, though descended from the Prophet, are not strictly\npriests, or, to make the distinction perfectly clear the Shereefs are to\nbe considered a dynasty corresponding to the type of Melchizdek, uniting\nin themselves the regal and sacerdotal authority, whilst the\n_Marabouteen_ were a family of priests like the sons of Aaron.\nAbd-el-Kader unites in himself the princely and sacerdotal authority\nlike the Shereefs, though not of the family of the Prophet. Mankind have\nalways been jealous of mere theocratic government, and dynasties of\npriests have always been failures in the arts of governing, and the\nEgyptian priests, though they struggled hard, and were the most\naccomplished of this class of men, could not make themselves the\nsovereigns of Egypt.\n\n[3] According to others the Sadia reigned before the Shereefs.\n\n[4] I was greatly astonished to read in Mr. Hay's \"Western Barbary,\" (p.\n123), these words--\"During one of the late rebellions, a beautiful young\ngirl was offered up as a propitiatory sacrifice, her throat being cut\nbefore the tent of the Sultan, and in his presence!\" This is an\nunmitigated libel on the Shereefian prince ruling Morocco. First of all,\nthe sacrifice of human beings is repudiated by every class of\ninhabitants in Barbary. Such rites, indeed, are unheard of, nay,\nunthought of. If the Mahometan religion has been powerful in any one\nthing, it is in that of rooting out from the mind of man every notion of\nhuman sacrifice. It is this which makes the sacrifice of the Saviour\nsuch an obnoxious doctrine to Mussulmen. It is true enough, at times,\noxen are immolated to God, but not to Moorish princes, \"to appease an\noffended potentate.\" One spring, when there was a great drought, the\npeople led up to the hill of Ghamart, near Carthage, a red heifer to be\nslaughtered, in order to appease the displeasure of Deity; and when the\nBey's frigate, which, a short time ago, carried a present to her\nBritannic Majesty, from Tunis to Malta, put back by stress of weather,\ntwo sheep were sacrificed to some tutelar saints, and two guns were\nfired in their honour. The companions of Abd-el-Kader in a storm, during\nhis passage from Oran to Toulon, threw handsful of salt to the raging\ndeep to appease its wild fury. But as to sacrificing human victims,\neither to an incensed Deity, or to man, impiously putting himself in the\nplace of God, the Moors of Barbary have not the least conception of such\nan enormity.\n\nIt would seem, unfortunately, that the practice of the gentleman, who\ntravelled a few miles into the interior of Morocco on a horse-mission,\nhad been to exaggerate everything, and, where effect was wanting, not to\nhave scrupled to have recourse to unadulterated invention. But this\nstyle of writing cannot be defended on any principle, when so serious a\ncase is brought forward as that of sacrificing a human victim to appease\nthe wrath of an incensed sovereign, and that prince now living in\namicable relations with ourselves.\n\n[5] Graeberg de Hemso, whilst consul-general for Sweden and Sardinia (at\nMorocco!) concludes the genealogy of these Mussulman sovereigns with\nthis strange, but Catholic-spirited rhapsody:--\n\n\"Muley Abd-ur-Bakliman, who is now gloriously and happily reigning, whom\nwe pray Almighty God, all Goodness and Power, to protect and exalt by\nprolonging his life, glory, and reign in this world and in the next; and\ngiving him, during eternity, the heavenly beatitude, in order that his\nsoul, in the same manner as flame to flame, river to sea, may be united\nwith his sweetest, most perfect and ineffable Creator. Amen.\"\n\n[6] Yezeed was half-Irish, born of the renegade widow of an Irish\nsergeant of the corps of Sappers and Miners, who was placed at the\ndisposition of this government by England, and who died in Morocco. On\nhis death, the facile, buxom widow was admitted, \"nothing loath,\" into\nthe harem of Sidi-Mohammed, who boasted of having within its sacred\nenclosure of love and bliss, a woman from every clime.\n\nHere the daughter of Erin brought forth this ferocious tyrant, whose\nmaxim of carnage, and of inflicting suffering on humanity was, \"My\nempire can never be well governed, unless a stream of blood flows from\nthe gate of the palace to the gate of the city.\" To do Yezeed justice,\nhe followed out the instincts of his birth, and made war on all the\nworld except the English (or Irish). Tully's Letters on Tripoli give a\ngraphic account of the exploits of Yezeed, who, to his inherent cruelty,\nadded a fondness for practical (Hibernian) jokes.\n\nHis father sent him several times on a pilgrimage to Mecca to expiate\nhis crimes, when he amused, or alarmed, all the people whose countries\nhe passed through, by his terrific vagaries. One day he would cut off\nthe heads of a couple of his domestics, and play at bowls with them;\nanother day, he would ride across the path of an European, or a consul,\nand singe his whiskers with the discharge of a pistol-shot; another day,\nhe would collect all the poor of a district, and gorge them with a\nrazzia he had made on the effects of some rich over-fed Bashaw. The\nmultitude sometimes implored heaven's blessing on the head of Yezeed. at\nother times trembled for their own heads. Meanwhile, our European\nconsuls made profound obeisance to this son of the Shereef, enthroned in\nthe West. So the tyrant passed the innocent days of his pilgrimage. So\nthe godless herd of mankind acquiesced in the divine rights of royalty.\n\n[7] See Appendix at the end of this volume.\n\n[8] The middle Western Region consists of Algiers and part of Tunis.\n\n[9] Pliny, the Elder, confirms this tradition mentioned by Pliny. Marcus\nYarron reports, \"that in all Spain there are spread Iberians, Persians,\nPhoenicians, Celts, and Carthaginians.\" (Lib. iii. chap. 2).\n\n[10] In Latin, Mauri, Maurice, Maurici, Maurusci, and it is supposed, so\ncalled by the Greeks from their dark complexions.\n\n[11] The more probable derivation of this word is from _bar_, signifying\nland, or earth, in contradistinction from the sea, or desert, beyond the\ncultivable lands to the South. To give the term more force it is\ndoubled, after the style of the Semitic reduplication. De Haedo de la\nCaptividad gives a characteristic derivation, like a genuine hidalgo,\nwho proclaimed eternal war against Los Moros. He says--\"Moors, Alartes,\nCabayles, and some Turks, form all of them a dirty, lazy, inhuman,\nindomitable nation of beasts, and it is for this reason that, for the\nlast few years, I have accustomed myself to call that land the land of\nBarbary.\"\n\n[12] Procopius, de Bello Vandilico, lib. ii. cap. 10.\n\n[13] Some derive it from _Sarak_, an Arabic word which signifies to\nsteal, and hence, call the conquerors thieves. Others, and with more\nprobability, derive it from _Sharak_, the east, and make them Orientals,\nand others say there is an Arabic word _Saracini_, which means a\npastoral people, and assert that Saracine is a corruption from it, the\nnew Arabian immigrants being supposed to have been pastoral tribes.\n\n[14] Some suppose that _Amayeegh_ means \"great,\" and the tribes thus\ndistinguished themselves, as our neighbours are wont to do by the phrase\n\"la grande nation.\" The Shoulah are vulgarly considered to be descended\nfrom the Philistines, and to have fled before Joshua on the conquest of\nPalestine.\n\nIn his translation of the Description of Spain, by the Shereef El-Edris\n(Madrid, 1799), Don Josef Antonio Conde speaks of the Berbers in a\nnote--\n\n\"Masmuda, one of the five principal tribes of Barbaria; the others are\nZeneta, called Zenetes in our novels and histories, Sanhagha which we\nname Zenagas; Gomesa is spelt in our histories Gomares and Gomeles.\nHuroara, some of these were originally from Arabia; there were others,\nbut not so distinguished. La de Ketama was, according to tradition,\nAfrican, one of the most ancient, for having come with Afrikio.\n\n\"Ben Kis Ben Taifi Ben Teba, the younger, who came from the king of the\nAssyrians, to the land of the west.\n\n\"None of these primitive tribes appear to have been known to the Romans,\ntheir historians, however, have transmitted to us many names of other\naboriginal tribes, some of which resemble fractions now existing, as the\nGetules are probably the present Geudala or Geuzoula. But the present\nBerbers do not correspond with the names of the five original people\njust mentioned. In Morocco, there are Amayeegh and Shelouh, in Algeria\nthe Kabyles, in Tunis the Aoures, sometimes the Shouwiah, and in Sahara\nthe Touarichs. There are, besides, numerous subdivisions and admixtures\nof these tribes.\"\n\n[15] Monsieur Balbi is decidedly the most recent, as well as the best\nauthority to apply to for a short and definite description of this most\ncelebrated mountain system, called by him \"Systeme Atlantique,\" and I\nshall therefore annex what he says on this interesting subject,\n\"Orographie.\" He says--\"Of the 'Systeme Atlantique,' which derives its\nname from the Mount Atlas, renowned for so many centuries, and still so\nlittle known; we include in this vast system, all the heights of the\nregion of Maghreb--we mean the mountain of the Barbary States--as well\nas the elevations scattered in the immense Sahara or Desert. It appears\nthat the most important ridge extends from the neighbourhood of Cape\nNoun, or the Atlantic, as far as the east of the Great Syrte in the\nState of Tripoli. In this vast space it crosses the new State of\nSidi-Hesdham, the Empire of Morocco, the former State of Algiers, as\nwell as the State of Tripoli and the Regency of Tunis. It is in the\nEmpire of Morocco, and especially in the east of the town of Morocco,\nand in the south-east of Fez, that that ridge presents the greatest\nheights of the whole system. It goes on diminishing afterwards in height\nas it extends towards the east, so that it appears the summits of the\nterritory of Algiers are higher than those on the territory of Tunis,\nand the latter are less high than those to be found in the State of\nTripoli. Several secondary ridges diverge in different directions from\nthe principal chain; we shall name among them the one which ends at the\nStrait of Gibraltar in the Empire of Morocco. Several intermediary\nmountains seem to connect with one another the secondary chains which\nintersect the territories of Algiers and Tunis. Geographers call Little\nAtlas the secondary mountains of the land of Sous, in opposition to the\nname of Great Atlas, they give to the high mountains of the Empire of\nMorocco. In that part of the principal chain called Mount Gharian, in\nthe south of Tripoli, several low branches branch off and under the\nnames of Mounts Maray, Black Mount Haroudje, Mount Liberty, Mount\nTiggerandoumma and others less known, furrow the great solitudes of the\nDesert of Lybia and Sahara Proper. From observations made on the spot by\nMr. Bruguiere in the former state of Algiers, the great chain which\nseveral geographers traced beyond the Little Atlas under the name of\nGreat Atlas does not exist. The inhabitants of Mediah who were\nquestioned on the subject by this traveller, told him positively, that\nthe way from that town to the Sahara was through a ground more or less\nelevated, and <DW72>s more or less steep, and without having any chain of\nmountains to cross. The Pass of Teniah which leads from Algiers to\nMediah is, therefore, included in the principal chain of that part of\nthe Regency.\n\n[16] Xenophon, in his Anabasis, speaks of ostriches in Mesopotamia being\nrun down by fleet horses.\n\n[17] Mount Atlas was called Dyris by the ancient aborigines, or Derem,\nits name amongst the modern aborigines. This word has been compared to\nthe Hebrew, signifying the place or aspect of the sun at noon-day, as if\nMount Atlas was the back of the world, or the cultivated parts of the\nglobe, and over which the sun was seen at full noon, in all his fierce\nand glorious splendour. Bochart connects the term with the Hebrew\nmeaning 'great' or 'mighty,' which epithet would be naturally applied to\nthe Atlas, and all mountains, by either a savage or civilized people. We\nhave, also, on the northern coast, Russadirum, the name given by the\nMoors to Cape Bon, which is evidently a compound of _Ras_, head, and\n_dirum_, mountain, or the head of the mountain.\n\nWe have again the root of this word in Doa-el-Hamman, Tibet Deera, &c.,\nthe names of separate chains of the mighty Atlas. Any way, the modern\nDer-en is seen to be the same with the ancient Dir-is.\n\n[18] The only way of obtaining any information at all, is through the\nregisters of taxation; and, to the despotism and exactions of these and\nmost governments, we owe a knowledge of the proximate amount of the\nnumbers of mankind.\n\n[19] Tangier, Mogador, Wadnoun, and Sous have already been described,\nwholly, or in part.\n\n[20] In 936, Arzila was sacked by the English, and remained for twenty\nyears uninhabited.\n\n[21] According to Mr. Hay, a portion of the Salee Rovers seem to have\nfinally taken refuge here. Up the river El-Kous, the Imperial squadron\nlay in ordinary, consisting of a corvette, two brigs, (once\nmerchant-vessels, and which had been bought of Christians), and a\nschooner, with some few gun-boats, and even these two or three vessels\nwere said to be all unfit for sea. But, when Great Britain captured the\nrock of Gibraltar, we, supplanting the Moors became the formidable\ntoll-keepers of the Herculean Straits, and the Salee rivers have ever\nsince been in our power. If the Shereefs have levied war or tribute on\nEuropean navies since that periods it has been under our tacit sanction.\nThe opinion of Nelson is not the less true, that, should England engage\nin war with any maritime State of Europe, Morocco must be our warm and\nactive friend or enemy, and, if our enemy, we must again possess\nourselves of our old garrison of Tangier.\n\n[22] So called, it is supposed, from the quantity of aniseed grown in\nthe neighbourhood.\n\n[23] Near Cape Blanco is the ruined town of Tit or Tet, supposed to be\nof Carthaginian origin, and once also possessed by the Portuguese, when\ncommerce therein flourished.\n\n[24] El-Kesar is a very common name of a fortified town, and is usually\nwritten by the Spaniards Alcazar, being the name of the celebrated royal\npalace at Seville.\n\n[25] Marmol makes this city to have succeeded the ancient Roman town of\nSilda or Gilda. Mequinez has been called Ez-Zetounah, from the immense\nquantities of olives in its immediate vicinity.\n\n[26] Don J. A. Conde says--\"Fes or sea Fez, the capital of the realm of\nthat name; the fables of its origin, and the grandeur of the Moors, who\nalways speak of their cities as foundations of heroes, or lords of the\nwhole world, &c., a foible of which our historians are guilty.\nNasir-Eddin and the same Ullug Beig say, for certain, that Fez is the\ncourt of the king in the west. I must observe here, that nothing is less\nauthentic than the opinions given by Casiri in his Library of the\nEscurial, that by the word Algarb, they always mean the west of Spain,\nand by the word Almagreb, the west of Africa; one of these appellations\nis generally used for the other. The same Casiri says, with regard to\nFez, that it was founded by Edno Ben Abdallah, under the reign of\nAlmansor Abu Giafar; he is quite satisfied with that assertion, but does\nnot perceive that it contains a glaring anachronism. Fez was already a\nvery ancient city before the Mohammed Anuabi of the Mussulmen, and\nJoseph, in his A. J., mentions a city of Mauritania; the prophet Nahum\nspeaks of it also, when he addresses Ninive, he presents it as an\nexample for No Ammon. He enumerates its districts and cities, and says,\nFut and Lubim, Fez and Lybia, &c.\n\n[27] I imagine we shall never know the truth of this until the French\nmarch an army into Fez, and sack the library.\n\n[28] It is true enough what the governor says about _quietness_, but the\nnovelty of the mission turned the heads of the people, and made a great\nnoise among them. The slave-dealers of Sous vowed vengeance against me,\nand threatened to \"rip open my bowels\" if I went down there.\n\n[29] The Sultan's Minister, Ben Oris, addressing our government on the\nquestion says, \"Whosoever sets any person free God will set his soul\nfree from the fire,\" (hell), quoting the Koran.\n\n[30] A person going to the Emperor without a present, is like a menace\nat court, for a present corresponds to our \"good morning.\"\n\n[31] _Bash_, means chief, as Bash-Mameluke, chief of the Mamelukes. It\nis a Turkish term.\n\n[32] This office answers vulgarly to our _Boots_ at English inns.\n\n[33] Bismilla, Arabic for \"In the name of God!\" the Mohammedan grace\nbefore meat, and also drink.\n\n[34] Shaw says.--\"The hobara is of the bigness of a capon, it feeds upon\nthe little grubs or insects, and frequents the confines of the Desert.\nThe body is of a light dun or yellowish colour, and marked over with\nlittle brown touches, whilst the larger feathers of the wing are black,\nwith each of them a white spot near the middle; those of the neck are\nwhitish with black streaks, and are long and erected when the bird is\nattacked. The bill is flat like the starling's, nearly an inch and a\nhalf long, and the legs agree in shape and in the want of the hinder toe\nwith the bustard's, but it is not, as Golins says, the bustard, that\nbird being twice as big as the hobara. Nothing can be more entertaining\nthan to see this bird pursued by the hawk, and what a variety of flights\nand stratagems it makes use of to escape.\" The French call the hobara, a\nlittle bustard, _poule de Carthage_, or Carthage-fowl. They are\nfrequently sold in the market of Tunis, as ordinary fowls, but eat\nsomething like pheasant, and their flesh is red.\n\n[35] The most grandly beautiful view in Tunis is that from the\nBelvidere, about a mile north-west from the capital, looking immediately\nover the Marsa road. Here, on a hill of very moderate elevation, you\nhave the most beautiful as well as the most magnificent panoramic view\nof sea and lake, mountain and plain, town and village, in the whole\nRegency, or perhaps in any other part of North Africa. There are besides\nmany lovely walks around the capital, particularly among and around the\ncraggy heights of the south-east. But these are little frequented by the\nEuropean residents, the women especially, who are so stay-at-homeative\nthat the greater part of them never walked round the suburbs once in\ntheir lives. Europeans generally prefer the Marina, lined on each side,\nnot with pleasant trees, but dead animals, sending forth a most\noffensive smell.\n\n[36] Shaw says: \"The rhaad, or safsaf, is a granivorous and gregarious\nbird, which wanteth the hinder toe. There are two species, and both\nabout and a little larger than the ordinary pullet. The belly of both is\nwhite, back and wings of a buff colour spotted with brown, tail lighter\nand marked all along with black transverse streaks, beak and legs\nstronger than the partridge. The name rhaad, \"thunder,\" is given to it\nfrom the noise it makes on the ground when it rises, safsaf, from its\nbeating the air, a sound imitating the motion.\"\n\n[37] Ghafsa, whose name Bochart derives from the Hebrew \"comprimere,\"\nis an ancient city, claiming as its august founder, the Libyan\nHercules. It was one of the principal towns in the dominions of\nJugurtha, and well-fortified, rendered secure by being placed in the\nmidst of immense deserts, fabled to have been inhabited solely by\nsnakes and serpents. Marius took it by a _coup-de-main_, and put all\nthe inhabitants to the sword. The modern city is built on a gentle\neminence, between two arid mountains, and, in a great part, with the\nmaterials of the ancient one. Ghafsa has no wall of _euceinte_, or\nrather a ruined wall surrounds it, and is defended by a kasbah,\ncontaining a small garrison. This place may be called the gate of the\nTunisian Sahara; it is the limit of Blad-el-Jereed; the sands begin now\nto disappear, and the land becomes better, and more suited to the\ncultivation of corn. Three villages are situated in the environs, Sala,\nEl-Kesir, and El-Ghetar. A fraction of the tribe of Hammand deposit\ntheir grain in Ghafsa. This town is famous for its manufactories of\nbaraeans and blankets ornamented with pretty  flowers. There is\nalso a nitre and powder-manufactory, the former obtained from the earth\nby a very rude process.\n\nThe environs are beautifully laid out in plantations of the fig, the\npomegranate, and the orange, and especially the datepalm, and the\nolive-tree. The oil made here is of peculiarly good quality, and is\nexported to Tugurt, and other oases of the Desert.\n\n[38] Kaemtz's Meteorology, p. 191.\n\n[39] This is the national dish of Barbary, and is a preparation of\nwheat-flour granulated, boiled by the steam of meat. It is most\nnutritive, and is eaten with or without meat and vegetables. When the\ngrains are large, it is called hamza.\n\n[40] A camel-load is about five cantars, and a cantar is a hundred\nweight.\n\n\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note: In this electronic edition, the footnotes were\nnumbered and relocated to the end of the work.

HEP!\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nLOOKING INWARD.\n\nIt is my habit to give an account to myself of the characters I meet\nwith: can I give any true account of my own? I am a bachelor, without\ndomestic distractions of any sort, and have all my life been an\nattentive companion to myself, flattering my nature agreeably on\nplausible occasions, reviling it rather bitterly when it mortified me,\nand in general remembering its doings and sufferings with a tenacity\nwhich is too apt to raise surprise if not disgust at the careless\ninaccuracy of my acquaintances, who impute to me opinions I never held,\nexpress their desire to convert me to my favourite ideas, forget whether\nI have ever been to the East, and are capable of being three several\ntimes astonished at my never having told them before of my accident in\nthe Alps, causing me the nervous shock which has ever since notably\ndiminished my digestive powers. Surely I ought to know myself better\nthan these indifferent outsiders can know me; nay, better even than my\nintimate friends, to whom I have never breathed those items of my inward\nexperience which have chiefly shaped my life.\n\nYet I have often been forced into the reflection that even the\nacquaintances who are as forgetful of my biography and tenets as they\nwould be if I were a dead philosopher, are probably aware of certain\npoints in me which may not be included in my most active suspicion. We\nsing an exquisite passage out of tune and innocently repeat it for the\ngreater pleasure of our hearers. Who can be aware of what his foreign\naccent is in the ears of a native? And how can a man be conscious of\nthat dull perception which causes him to mistake altogether what will\nmake him agreeable to a particular woman, and to persevere eagerly in a\nbehaviour which she is privately recording against him? I have had some\nconfidences from my female friends as to their opinion of other men whom\nI have observed trying to make themselves amiable, and it has occurred\nto me that though I can hardly be so blundering as Lippus and the rest\nof those mistaken candidates for favour whom I have seen ruining their\nchance by a too elaborate personal canvass, I must still come under the\ncommon fatality of mankind and share the liability to be absurd without\nknowing that I am absurd. It is in the nature of foolish reasoning to\nseem good to the foolish reasoner. Hence with all possible study of\nmyself, with all possible effort to escape from the pitiable illusion\nwhich makes men laugh, shriek, or curl the lip at Folly's likeness, in\ntotal unconsciousness that it resembles themselves, I am obliged to\nrecognise that while there are secrets in me unguessed by others, these\nothers have certain items of knowledge about the extent of my powers and\nthe figure I make with them, which in turn are secrets unguessed by me.\nWhen I was a lad I danced a hornpipe with arduous scrupulosity, and\nwhile suffering pangs of pallid shyness was yet proud of my superiority\nas a dancing pupil, imagining for myself a high place in the estimation\nof beholders; but I can now picture the amusement they had in the\nincongruity of my solemn face and ridiculous legs. What sort of hornpipe\nam I dancing now?\n\nThus if I laugh at you, O fellow-men! if I trace with curious interest\nyour labyrinthine self-delusions, note the inconsistencies in your\nzealous adhesions, and smile at your helpless endeavours in a rashly\nchosen part, it is not that I feel myself aloof from you: the more\nintimately I seem to discern your weaknesses, the stronger to me is the\nproof that I share them. How otherwise could I get the discernment?--for\neven what we are averse to, what we vow not to entertain, must have\nshaped or shadowed itself within us as a possibility before we can think\nof exorcising it. No man can know his brother simply as a spectator.\nDear blunderers, I am one of you. I wince at the fact, but I am not\nignorant of it, that I too am laughable on unsuspected occasions; nay,\nin the very tempest and whirlwind of my anger, I include myself under my\nown indignation. If the human race has a bad reputation, I perceive that\nI cannot escape being compromised. And thus while I carry in myself the\nkey to other men's experience, it is only by observing others that I can\nso far correct my self-ignorance as to arrive at the certainty that I am\nliable to commit myself unawares and to manifest some incompetency which\nI know no more of than the blind man knows of his image in the glass.\n\nIs it then possible to describe oneself at once faithfully and fully? In\nall autobiography there is, nay, ought to be, an incompleteness which\nmay have the effect of falsity. We are each of us bound to reticence by\nthe piety we owe to those who have been nearest to us and have had a\nmingled influence over our lives; by the fellow-feeling which should\nrestrain us from turning our volunteered and picked confessions into an\nact of accusation against others, who have no chance of vindicating\nthemselves; and most of all by that reverence for the higher efforts of\nour common nature, which commands us to bury its lowest fatalities, its\ninvincible remnants of the brute, its most agonising struggles with\ntemptation, in unbroken silence. But the incompleteness which comes of\nself-ignorance may be compensated by self-betrayal. A man who is\naffected to tears in dwelling on the generosity of his own sentiments\nmakes me aware of several things not included under those terms. Who has\nsinned more against those three duteous reticences than Jean Jacques?\nYet half our impressions of his character come not from what he means to\nconvey, but from what he unconsciously enables us to discern.\n\nThis _naive_ veracity of self-presentation is attainable by the\nslenderest talent on the most trivial occasions. The least lucid and\nimpressive of orators may be perfectly successful in showing us the weak\npoints of his grammar. Hence I too may be so far like Jean Jacques as to\ncommunicate more than I am aware of. I am not indeed writing an\nautobiography, or pretending to give an unreserved description of\nmyself, but only offering some slight confessions in an apologetic\nlight, to indicate that if in my absence you dealt as freely with my\nunconscious weaknesses as I have dealt with the unconscious weaknesses\nof others, I should not feel myself warranted by common-sense in\nregarding your freedom of observation as an exceptional case of\nevil-speaking; or as malignant interpretation of a character which\nreally offers no handle to just objection; or even as an unfair use for\nyour amusement of disadvantages which, since they are mine, should be\nregarded with more than ordinary tenderness. Let me at least try to feel\nmyself in the ranks with my fellow-men. It is true, that I would rather\nnot hear either your well-founded ridicule or your judicious strictures.\nThough not averse to finding fault with myself, and conscious of\ndeserving lashes, I like to keep the scourge in my own discriminating\nhand. I never felt myself sufficiently meritorious to like being hated\nas a proof of my superiority, or so thirsty for improvement as to desire\nthat all my acquaintances should give me their candid opinion of me. I\nreally do not want to learn from my enemies: I prefer having none to\nlearn from. Instead of being glad when men use me despitefully, I wish\nthey would behave better and find a more amiable occupation for their\nintervals of business. In brief, after a close intimacy with myself for\na longer period than I choose to mention, I find within me a permanent\nlonging for approbation, sympathy, and love.\n\nYet I am a bachelor, and the person I love best has never loved me, or\nknown that I loved her. Though continually in society, and caring about\nthe joys and sorrows of my neighbours, I feel myself, so far as my\npersonal lot is concerned, uncared for and alone. \"Your own fault, my\ndear fellow!\" said Minutius Felix, one day that I had incautiously\nmentioned this uninteresting fact. And he was right--in senses other\nthan he intended. Why should I expect to be admired, and have my company\ndoated on? I have done no services to my country beyond those of every\npeaceable orderly citizen; and as to intellectual contribution, my only\npublished work was a failure, so that I am spoken of to inquiring\nbeholders as \"the author of a book you have probably not seen.\" (The\nwork was a humorous romance, unique in its kind, and I am told is much\ntasted in a Cherokee translation, where the jokes are rendered with all\nthe serious eloquence characteristic of the Red races.) This sort of\ndistinction, as a writer nobody is likely to have read, can hardly\ncounteract an indistinctness in my articulation, which the\nbest-intentioned loudness will not remedy. Then, in some quarters my\nawkward feet are against me, the length of my upper lip, and an\ninveterate way I have of walking with my head foremost and my chin\nprojecting. One can become only too well aware of such things by looking\nin the glass, or in that other mirror held up to nature in the frank\nopinions of street-boys, or of our Free People travelling by excursion\ntrain; and no doubt they account for the half-suppressed smile which I\nhave observed on some fair faces when I have first been presented before\nthem. This direct perceptive judgment is not to be argued against. But I\nam tempted to remonstrate when the physical points I have mentioned are\napparently taken to warrant unfavourable inferences concerning my mental\nquickness. With all the increasing uncertainty which modern progress has\nthrown over the relations of mind and body, it seems tolerably clear\nthat wit cannot be seated in the upper lip, and that the balance of the\nhaunches in walking has nothing to do with the subtle discrimination of\nideas. Yet strangers evidently do not expect me to make a clever\nobservation, and my good things are as unnoticed as if they were\nanonymous pictures. I have indeed had the mixed satisfaction of finding\nthat when they were appropriated by some one else they were found\nremarkable and even brilliant. It is to be borne in mind that I am not\nrich, have neither stud nor cellar, and no very high connections such as\ngive to a look of imbecility a certain prestige of inheritance through a\ntitled line; just as \"the Austrian lip\" confers a grandeur of historical\nassociations on a kind of feature which might make us reject an\nadvertising footman. I have now and then done harm to a good cause by\nspeaking for it in public, and have discovered too late that my attitude\non the occasion would more suitably have been that of negative\nbeneficence. Is it really to the advantage of an opinion that I should\nbe known to hold it? And as to the force of my arguments, that is a\nsecondary consideration with audiences who have given a new scope to the\n_ex pede Herculem_ principle, and from awkward feet infer awkward\nfallacies. Once, when zeal lifted me on my legs, I distinctly heard an\nenlightened artisan remark, \"Here's a rum cut!\"--and doubtless he\nreasoned in the same way as the elegant Glycera when she politely puts\non an air of listening to me, but elevates her eyebrows and chills her\nglance in sign of predetermined neutrality: both have their reasons for\njudging the quality of my speech beforehand.\n\nThis sort of reception to a man of affectionate disposition, who has\nalso the innocent vanity of desiring to be agreeable, has naturally a\ndepressing if not embittering tendency; and in early life I began to\nseek for some consoling point of view, some warrantable method of\nsoftening the hard peas I had to walk on, some comfortable fanaticism\nwhich might supply the needed self-satisfaction. At one time I dwelt\nmuch on the idea of compensation; trying to believe that I was all the\nwiser for my bruised vanity, that I had the higher place in the true\nspiritual scale, and even that a day might come when some visible\ntriumph would place me in the French heaven of having the laughers on my\nside. But I presently perceived that this was a very odious sort of\nself-cajolery. Was it in the least true that I was wiser than several of\nmy friends who made an excellent figure, and were perhaps praised a\nlittle beyond their merit? Is the ugly unready man in the corner,\noutside the current of conversation, really likely to have a fairer\nview of things than the agreeable talker, whose success strikes the\nunsuccessful as a repulsive example of forwardness and conceit? And as\nto compensation in future years, would the fact that I myself got it\nreconcile me to an order of things in which I could see a multitude with\nas bad a share as mine, who, instead of getting their corresponding\ncompensation, were getting beyond the reach of it in old age? What could\nbe more contemptible than the mood of mind which makes a man measure the\njustice of divine or human law by the agreeableness of his own shadow\nand the ample satisfaction of his own desires?\n\nI dropped a form of consolation which seemed to be encouraging me in the\npersuasion that my discontent was the chief evil in the world, and my\nbenefit the soul of good in that evil. May there not be at least a\npartial release from the imprisoning verdict that a man's philosophy is\nthe formula of his personality? In certain branches of science we can\nascertain our personal equation, the measure of difference between our\nown judgments and an average standard: may there not be some\ncorresponding correction of our personal partialities in moral\ntheorising? If a squint or other ocular defect disturbs my vision, I can\nget instructed in the fact, be made aware that my condition is abnormal,\nand either through spectacles or diligent imagination I can learn the\naverage appearance of things: is there no remedy or corrective for that\ninward squint which consists in a dissatisfied egoism or other want of\nmental balance? In my conscience I saw that the bias of personal\ndiscontent was just as misleading and odious as the bias of\nself-satisfaction. Whether we look through the rose- glass or\nthe indigo, we are equally far from the hues which the healthy human eye\nbeholds in heaven above and earth below. I began to dread ways of\nconsoling which were really a flattering of native illusions, a\nfeeding-up into monstrosity of an inward growth already\ndisproportionate; to get an especial scorn for that scorn of mankind\nwhich is a transmuted disappointment of preposterous claims; to watch\nwith peculiar alarm lest what I called my philosophic estimate of the\nhuman lot in general, should be a mere prose lyric expressing my own\npain and consequent bad temper. The standing-ground worth striving after\nseemed to be some Delectable Mountain, whence I could see things in\nproportions as little as possible determined by that self-partiality\nwhich certainly plays a necessary part in our bodily sustenance, but has\na starving effect on the mind.\n\nThus I finally gave up any attempt to make out that I preferred cutting\na bad figure, and that I liked to be despised, because in this way I was\ngetting more virtuous than my successful rivals; and I have long looked\nwith suspicion on all views which are recommended as peculiarly\nconsolatory to wounded vanity or other personal disappointment. The\nconsolations of egoism are simply a change of attitude or a resort to a\nnew kind of diet which soothes and fattens it. Fed in this way it is apt\nto become a monstrous spiritual pride, or a chuckling satisfaction that\nthe final balance will not be against us but against those who now\neclipse us. Examining the world in order to find consolation is very\nmuch like looking carefully over the pages of a great book in order to\nfind our own name, if not in the text, at least in a laudatory note:\nwhether we find what we want or not, our preoccupation has hindered us\nfrom a true knowledge of the contents. But an attention fixed on the\nmain theme or various matter of the book would deliver us from that\nslavish subjection to our own self-importance. And I had the mighty\nvolume of the world before me. Nay, I had the struggling action of a\nmyriad lives around me, each single life as dear to itself as mine to\nme. Was there no escape here from this stupidity of a murmuring\nself-occupation? Clearly enough, if anything hindered my thought from\nrising to the force of passionately interested contemplation, or my poor\npent-up pond of sensitiveness from widening into a beneficent river of\nsympathy, it was my own dulness; and though I could not make myself the\nreverse of shallow all at once, I had at least learned where I had\nbetter turn my attention.\n\nSomething came of this alteration in my point of view, though I admit\nthat the result is of no striking kind. It is unnecessary for me to\nutter modest denials, since none have assured me that I have a vast\nintellectual scope, or--what is more surprising, considering I have\ndone so little--that I might, if I chose, surpass any distinguished man\nwhom they wish to depreciate. I have not attained any lofty peak of\nmagnanimity, nor would I trust beforehand in my capability of meeting a\nsevere demand for moral heroism. But that I have at least succeeded in\nestablishing a habit of mind which keeps watch against my\nself-partiality and promotes a fair consideration of what touches the\nfeelings or the fortunes of my neighbours, seems to be proved by the\nready confidence with which men and women appeal to my interest in their\nexperience. It is gratifying to one who would above all things avoid the\ninsanity of fancying himself a more momentous or touching object than he\nreally is, to find that nobody expects from him the least sign of such\nmental aberration, and that he is evidently held capable of listening to\nall kinds of personal outpouring without the least disposition to become\ncommunicative in the same way. This confirmation of the hope that my\nbearing is not that of the self-flattering lunatic is given me in ample\nmeasure. My acquaintances tell me unreservedly of their triumphs and\ntheir piques; explain their purposes at length, and reassure me with\ncheerfulness as to their chances of success; insist on their theories\nand accept me as a dummy with whom they rehearse their side of future\ndiscussions; unwind their coiled-up griefs in relation to their\nhusbands, or recite to me examples of feminine incomprehensibleness as\ntypified in their wives; mention frequently the fair applause which\ntheir merits have wrung from some persons, and the attacks to which\ncertain oblique motives have stimulated others. At the time when I was\nless free from superstition about my own power of charming, I\noccasionally, in the glow of sympathy which embraced me and my confiding\nfriend on the subject of his satisfaction or resentment, was urged to\nhint at a corresponding experience in my own case; but the signs of a\nrapidly lowering pulse and spreading nervous depression in my previously\nvivacious interlocutor, warned me that I was acting on that dangerous\nmisreading, \"Do as you are done by.\" Recalling the true version of the\ngolden rule, I could not wish that others should lower my spirits as I\nwas lowering my friend's. After several times obtaining the same result\nfrom a like experiment in which all the circumstances were varied except\nmy own personality, I took it as an established inference that these\nfitful signs of a lingering belief in my own importance were generally\nfelt to be abnormal, and were something short of that sanity which I\naimed to secure. Clearness on this point is not without its\ngratifications, as I have said. While my desire to explain myself in\nprivate ears has been quelled, the habit of getting interested in the\nexperience of others has been continually gathering strength, and I am\nreally at the point of finding that this world would be worth living in\nwithout any lot of one's own. Is it not possible for me to enjoy the\nscenery of the earth without saying to myself, I have a cabbage-garden\nin it? But this sounds like the lunacy of fancying oneself everybody\nelse and being unable to play one's own part decently--another form of\nthe disloyal attempt to be independent of the common lot, and to live\nwithout a sharing of pain.\n\nPerhaps I have made self-betrayals enough already to show that I have\nnot arrived at that non-human independence. My conversational\nreticences about myself turn into garrulousness on paper--as the\nsea-lion plunges and swims the more energetically because his limbs are\nof a sort to make him shambling on land. The act of writing, in spite of\npast experience, brings with it the vague, delightful illusion of an\naudience nearer to my idiom than the Cherokees, and more numerous than\nthe visionary One for whom many authors have declared themselves willing\nto go through the pleasing punishment of publication. My illusion is of\na more liberal kind, and I imagine a far-off, hazy, multitudinous\nassemblage, as in a picture of Paradise, making an approving chorus to\nthe sentences and paragraphs of which I myself particularly enjoy the\nwriting. The haze is a necessary condition. If any physiognomy becomes\ndistinct in the foreground, it is fatal. The countenance is sure to be\none bent on discountenancing my innocent intentions: it is pale-eyed,\nincapable of being amused when I am amused or indignant at what makes me\nindignant; it stares at my presumption, pities my ignorance, or is\nmanifestly preparing to expose the various instances in which I\nunconsciously disgrace myself. I shudder at this too corporeal auditor,\nand turn towards another point of the compass where the haze is\nunbroken. Why should I not indulge this remaining illusion, since I do\nnot take my approving choral paradise as a warrant for setting the press\nto work again and making some thousand sheets of superior paper\nunsaleable? I leave my manuscripts to a judgment outside my imagination,\nbut I will not ask to hear it, or request my friend to pronounce, before\nI have been buried decently, what he really thinks of my parts, and to\nstate candidly whether my papers would be most usefully applied in\nlighting the cheerful domestic fire. It is too probable that he will be\nexasperated at the trouble I have given him of reading them; but the\nconsequent clearness and vivacity with which he could demonstrate to me\nthat the fault of my manuscripts, as of my one published work, is simply\nflatness, and not that surpassing subtilty which is the preferable\nground of popular neglect--this verdict, however instructively\nexpressed, is a portion of earthly discipline of which I will not\nbeseech my friend to be the instrument. Other persons, I am aware, have\nnot the same cowardly shrinking from a candid opinion of their\nperformances, and are even importunately eager for it; but I have\nconvinced myself in numerous cases that such exposers of their own back\nto the smiter were of too hopeful a disposition to believe in the\nscourge, and really trusted in a pleasant anointing, an outpouring of\nbalm without any previous wounds. I am of a less trusting disposition,\nand will only ask my friend to use his judgment in insuring me against\nposthumous mistake.\n\nThus I make myself a charter to write, and keep the pleasing, inspiring\nillusion of being listened to, though I may sometimes write about\nmyself. What I have already said on this too familiar theme has been\nmeant only as a preface, to show that in noting the weaknesses of my\nacquaintances I am conscious of my fellowship with them. That a\ngratified sense of superiority is at the root of barbarous laughter may\nbe at least half the truth. But there is a loving laughter in which the\nonly recognised superiority is that of the ideal self, the God within,\nholding the mirror and the scourge for our own pettiness as well as our\nneighbours'.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nLOOKING BACKWARD.\n\nMost of us who have had decent parents would shrink from wishing that\nour father and mother had been somebody else whom we never knew; yet it\nis held no impiety, rather, a graceful mark of instruction, for a man to\nwail that he was not the son of another age and another nation, of which\nalso he knows nothing except through the easy process of an imperfect\nimagination and a flattering fancy.\n\nBut the period thus looked back on with a purely admiring regret, as\nperfect enough to suit a superior mind, is always a long way off; the\ndesirable contemporaries are hardly nearer than Leonardo da Vinci, most\nlikely they are the fellow-citizens of Pericles, or, best of all, of the\nAeolic lyrists whose sparse remains suggest a comfortable contrast with\nour redundance. No impassioned personage wishes he had been born in the\nage of Pitt, that his ardent youth might have eaten the dearest bread,\ndressed itself with the longest coat-tails and the shortest waist, or\nheard the loudest grumbling at the heaviest war-taxes; and it would be\nreally something original in polished verse if one of our young writers\ndeclared he would gladly be turned eighty-five that he might have known\nthe joy and pride of being an Englishman when there were fewer reforms\nand plenty of highwaymen, fewer discoveries and more faces pitted with\nthe small-pox, when laws were made to keep up the price of corn, and the\ntroublesome Irish were more miserable. Three-quarters of a century ago\nis not a distance that lends much enchantment to the view. We are\nfamiliar with the average men of that period, and are still consciously\nencumbered with its bad contrivances and mistaken acts. The lords and\ngentlemen painted by young Lawrence talked and wrote their nonsense in a\ntongue we thoroughly understand; hence their times are not much\nflattered, not much glorified by the yearnings of that modern sect of\nFlagellants who make a ritual of lashing--not themselves but--all their\nneighbours. To me, however, that paternal time, the time of my father's\nyouth, never seemed prosaic, for it came to my imagination first through\nhis memories, which made a wondrous perspective to my little daily world\nof discovery. And for my part I can call no age absolutely unpoetic: how\nshould it be so, since there are always children to whom the acorns and\nthe swallow's eggs are a wonder, always those human passions and\nfatalities through which Garrick as Hamlet in bob-wig and knee-breeches\nmoved his audience more than some have since done in velvet tunic and\nplume? But every age since the golden may be made more or less prosaic\nby minds that attend only to its vulgar and sordid elements, of which\nthere was always an abundance even in Greece and Italy, the favourite\nrealms of the retrospective optimists. To be quite fair towards the\nages, a little ugliness as well as beauty must be allowed to each of\nthem, a little implicit poetry even to those which echoed loudest with\nservile, pompous, and trivial prose.\n\nSuch impartiality is not in vogue at present. If we acknowledge our\nobligation to the ancients, it is hardly to be done without some\nflouting of our contemporaries, who with all their faults must be\nallowed the merit of keeping the world habitable for the refined\neulogists of the blameless past. One wonders whether the remarkable\noriginators who first had the notion of digging wells, or of churning\nfor butter, and who were certainly very useful to their own time as well\nas ours, were left quite free from invidious comparison with\npredecessors who let the water and the milk alone, or whether some\nrhetorical nomad, as he stretched himself on the grass with a good\nappetite for contemporary butter, became loud on the virtue of ancestors\nwho were uncorrupted by the produce of the cow; nay, whether in a high\nflight of imaginative self-sacrifice (after swallowing the butter) he\neven wished himself earlier born and already eaten for the sustenance of\na generation more _naive_ than his own.\n\nI have often had the fool's hectic of wishing about the unalterable, but\nwith me that useless exercise has turned chiefly on the conception of a\ndifferent self, and not, as it usually does in literature, on the\nadvantage of having been born in a different age, and more especially in\none where life is imagined to have been altogether majestic and\ngraceful. With my present abilities, external proportions, and generally\nsmall provision for ecstatic enjoyment, where is the ground for\nconfidence that I should have had a preferable career in such an epoch\nof society? An age in which every department has its awkward-squad seems\nin my mind's eye to suit me better. I might have wandered by the Strymon\nunder Philip and Alexander without throwing any new light on method or\norganising the sum of human knowledge; on the other hand, I might have\nobjected to Aristotle as too much of a systematiser, and have preferred\nthe freedom of a little self-contradiction as offering more chances of\ntruth. I gather, too, from the undeniable testimony of his disciple\nTheophrastus that there were bores, ill-bred persons, and detractors\neven in Athens, of species remarkably corresponding to the English, and\nnot yet made endurable by being classic; and altogether, with my present\nfastidious nostril, I feel that I am the better off for possessing\nAthenian life solely as an inodorous fragment of antiquity. As to\nSappho's Mitylene, while I am convinced that the Lesbian capital held\nsome plain men of middle stature and slow conversational powers, the\naddition of myself to their number, though clad in the majestic folds of\nthe himation and without cravat, would hardly have made a sensation\namong the accomplished fair ones who were so precise in adjusting their\nown drapery about their delicate ankles. Whereas by being another sort\nof person in the present age I might have given it some needful\ntheoretic clue; or I might have poured forth poetic strains which would\nhave anticipated theory and seemed a voice from \"the prophetic soul of\nthe wide world dreaming of things to come;\" or I might have been one of\nthose benignant lovely souls who, without astonishing the public and\nposterity, make a happy difference in the lives close around them, and\nin this way lift the average of earthly joy: in some form or other I\nmight have been so filled from the store of universal existence that I\nshould have been freed from that empty wishing which is like a child's\ncry to be inside a golden cloud, its imagination being too ignorant to\nfigure the lining of dimness and damp.\n\nOn the whole, though there is some rash boasting about enlightenment,\nand an occasional insistance on an originality which is that of the\npresent year's corn-crop, we seem too much disposed to indulge, and to\ncall by complimentary names, a greater charity for other portions of the\nhuman race than for our contemporaries. All reverence and gratitude for\nthe worthy Dead on whose labours we have entered, all care for the\nfuture generations whose lot we are preparing; but some affection and\nfairness for those who are doing the actual work of the world, some\nattempt to regard them with the same freedom from ill-temper, whether on\nprivate or public grounds, as we may hope will be felt by those who will\ncall us ancient! Otherwise, the looking before and after, which is our\ngrand human privilege, is in danger of turning to a sort of\nother-worldliness, breeding a more illogical indifference or bitterness\nthan was ever bred by the ascetic's contemplation of heaven. Except on\nthe ground of a primitive golden age and continuous degeneracy, I see no\nrational footing for scorning the whole present population of the globe,\nunless I scorn every previous generation from whom they have inherited\ntheir diseases of mind and body, and by consequence scorn my own scorn,\nwhich is equally an inheritance of mixed ideas and feelings concocted\nfor me in the boiling caldron of this universally contemptible life, and\nso on--scorning to infinity. This may represent some actual states of\nmind, for it is a narrow prejudice of mathematicians to suppose that\nways of thinking are to be driven out of the field by being reduced to\nan absurdity. The Absurd is taken as an excellent juicy thistle by many\nconstitutions.\n\nReflections of this sort have gradually determined me not to grumble at\nthe age in which I happen to have been born--a natural tendency\ncertainly older than Hesiod. Many ancient beautiful things are lost,\nmany ugly modern things have arisen; but invert the proposition and it\nis equally true. I at least am a modern with some interest in advocating\ntolerance, and notwithstanding an inborn beguilement which carries my\naffection and regret continually into an imagined past, I am aware that\nI must lose all sense of moral proportion unless I keep alive a stronger\nattachment to what is near, and a power of admiring what I best know and\nunderstand. Hence this question of wishing to be rid of one's\ncontemporaries associates itself with my filial feeling, and calls up\nthe thought that I might as justifiably wish that I had had other\nparents than those whose loving tones are my earliest memory, and whose\nlast parting first taught me the meaning of death. I feel bound to quell\nsuch a wish as blasphemy.\n\nBesides, there are other reasons why I am contented that my father was a\ncountry parson, born much about the same time as Scott and Wordsworth;\nnotwithstanding certain qualms I have felt at the fact that the property\non which I am living was saved out of tithe before the period of\ncommutation, and without the provisional transfiguration into a modus.\nIt has sometimes occurred to me when I have been taking a slice of\nexcellent ham that, from a too tenable point of view, I was breakfasting\non a small squealing black pig which, more than half a century ago, was\nthe unwilling representative of spiritual advantages not otherwise\nacknowledged by the grudging farmer or dairyman who parted with him. One\nenters on a fearful labyrinth in tracing compound interest backward, and\nsuch complications of thought have reduced the flavour of the ham; but\nsince I have nevertheless eaten it, the chief effect has been to\nmoderate the severity of my radicalism (which was not part of my\npaternal inheritance) and to raise the assuaging reflection, that if the\npig and the parishioner had been intelligent enough to anticipate my\nhistorical point of view, they would have seen themselves and the rector\nin a light that would have made tithe voluntary. Notwithstanding such\ndrawbacks I am rather fond of the mental furniture I got by having a\nfather who was well acquainted with all ranks of his neighbours, and am\nthankful that he was not one of those aristocratic clergymen who could\nnot have sat down to a meal with any family in the parish except my\nlord's--still more that he was not an earl or a marquis. A chief\nmisfortune of high birth is that it usually shuts a man out from the\nlarge sympathetic knowledge of human experience which comes from contact\nwith various classes on their own level, and in my father's time that\nentail of social ignorance had not been disturbed as we see it now. To\nlook always from overhead at the crowd of one's fellow-men must be in\nmany ways incapacitating, even with the best will and intelligence. The\nserious blunders it must lead to in the effort to manage them for their\ngood, one may see clearly by the mistaken ways people take of flattering\nand enticing those whose associations are unlike their own. Hence I have\nalways thought that the most fortunate Britons are those whose\nexperience has given them a practical share in many aspects of the\nnational lot, who have lived long among the mixed commonalty, roughing\nit with them under difficulties, knowing how their food tastes to them,\nand getting acquainted with their notions and motives not by inference\nfrom traditional types in literature or from philosophical theories, but\nfrom daily fellowship and observation. Of course such experience is apt\nto get antiquated, and my father might find himself much at a loss\namongst a mixed rural population of the present day; but he knew very\nwell what could be wisely expected from the miners, the weavers, the\nfield-labourers, and farmers of his own time--yes, and from the\naristocracy, for he had been brought up in close contact with them and\nhad been companion to a young nobleman who was deaf and dumb. \"A\nclergyman, lad,\" he used to say to me, \"should feel in himself a bit of\nevery class;\" and this theory had a felicitous agreement with his\ninclination and practice, which certainly answered in making him beloved\nby his parishioners. They grumbled at their obligations towards him; but\nwhat then? It was natural to grumble at any demand for payment, tithe\nincluded, but also natural for a rector to desire his tithe and look\nwell after the levying. A Christian pastor who did not mind about his\nmoney was not an ideal prevalent among the rural minds of fat central\nEngland, and might have seemed to introduce a dangerous laxity of\nsupposition about Christian laymen who happened to be creditors. My\nfather was none the less beloved because he was understood to be of a\nsaving disposition, and how could he save without getting his tithe? The\nsight of him was not unwelcome at any door, and he was remarkable among\nthe clergy of his district for having no lasting feud with rich or poor\nin his parish. I profited by his popularity, and for months after my\nmother's death, when I was a little fellow of nine, I was taken care of\nfirst at one homestead and then at another; a variety which I enjoyed\nmuch more than my stay at the Hall, where there was a tutor. Afterwards\nfor several years I was my father's constant companion in his outdoor\nbusiness, riding by his side on my little pony and listening to the\nlengthy dialogues he held with Darby or Joan, the one on the road or in\nthe fields, the other outside or inside her door. In my earliest\nremembrance of him his hair was already grey, for I was his youngest as\nwell as his only surviving child; and it seemed to me that advanced age\nwas appropriate to a father, as indeed in all respects I considered him\na parent so much to my honour, that the mention of my relationship to\nhim was likely to secure me regard among those to whom I was otherwise a\nstranger--my father's stories from his life including so many names of\ndistant persons that my imagination placed no limit to his\nacquaintanceship. He was a pithy talker, and his sermons bore marks of\nhis own composition. It is true, they must have been already old when I\nbegan to listen to them, and they were no more than a year's supply, so\nthat they recurred as regularly as the Collects. But though this system\nhas been much ridiculed, I am prepared to defend it as equally sound\nwith that of a liturgy; and even if my researches had shown me that some\nof my father's yearly sermons had been copied out from the works of\nelder divines, this would only have been another proof of his good\njudgment. One may prefer fresh eggs though laid by a fowl of the meanest\nunderstanding, but why fresh sermons?\n\nNor can I be sorry, though myself given to meditative if not active\ninnovation, that my father was a Tory who had not exactly a dislike to\ninnovators and dissenters, but a slight opinion of them as persons of\nill-founded self-confidence; whence my young ears gathered many details\nconcerning those who might perhaps have called themselves the more\nadvanced thinkers in our nearest market-town, tending to convince me\nthat their characters were quite as mixed as those of the thinkers\nbehind them. This circumstance of my rearing has at least delivered me\nfrom certain mistakes of classification which I observe in many of my\nsuperiors, who have apparently no affectionate memories of a goodness\nmingled with what they now regard as outworn prejudices. Indeed, my\nphilosophical notions, such as they are, continually carry me back to\nthe time when the fitful gleams of a spring day used to show me my own\nshadow as that of a small boy on a small pony, riding by the side of a\nlarger cob-mounted shadow over the breezy uplands which we used to\ndignify with the name of hills, or along by-roads with broad grassy\nborders and hedgerows reckless of utility, on our way to outlying\nhamlets, whose groups of inhabitants were as distinctive to my\nimagination as if they had belonged to different regions of the globe.\nFrom these we sometimes rode onward to the adjoining parish, where also\nmy father officiated, for he was a pluralist, but--I hasten to add--on\nthe smallest scale; for his one extra living was a poor vicarage, with\nhardly fifty parishioners, and its church would have made a very shabby\nbarn, the grey worm-eaten wood of its pews and pulpit, with their doors\nonly half hanging on the hinges, being exactly the colour of a lean\nmouse which I once observed as an interesting member of the scant\ncongregation, and conjectured to be the identical church mouse I had\nheard referred to as an example of extreme poverty; for I was a\nprecocious boy, and often reasoned after the fashion of my elders,\narguing that \"Jack and Jill\" were real personages in our parish, and\nthat if I could identify \"Jack\" I should find on him the marks of a\nbroken crown.\n\nSometimes when I am in a crowded London drawing-room (for I am a\ntown-bird now, acquainted with smoky eaves, and tasting Nature in the\nparks) quick flights of memory take me back among my father's\nparishioners while I am still conscious of elbowing men who wear the\nsame evening uniform as myself; and I presently begin to wonder what\nvarieties of history lie hidden under this monotony of aspect. Some of\nthem, perhaps, belong to families with many quarterings; but how many\n\"quarterings\" of diverse contact with their fellow-countrymen enter into\ntheir qualifications to be parliamentary leaders, professors of social\nscience, or journalistic guides of the popular mind? Not that I feel\nmyself a person made competent by experience; on the contrary, I argue\nthat since an observation of different ranks has still left me\npractically a poor creature, what must be the condition of those who\nobject even to read about the life of other British classes than their\nown? But of my elbowing neighbours with their crush hats, I usually\nimagine that the most distinguished among them have probably had a far\nmore instructive journey into manhood than mine. Here, perhaps, is a\nthought-worn physiognomy, seeming at the present moment to be classed as\na mere species of white cravat and swallow-tail, which may once, like\nFaraday's, have shown itself in curiously dubious embryonic form leaning\nagainst a cottage lintel in small corduroys, and hungrily eating a bit\nof brown bread and bacon; _there_ is a pair of eyes, now too much\nwearied by the gas-light of public assemblies, that once perhaps learned\nto read their native England through the same alphabet as mine--not\nwithin the boundaries of an ancestral park, never even being driven\nthrough the county town five miles off, but--among the midland villages\nand markets, along by the tree-studded hedgerows, and where the heavy\nbarges seem in the distance to float mysteriously among the rushes and\nthe feathered grass. Our vision, both real and ideal, has since then\nbeen filled with far other scenes: among eternal snows and stupendous\nsun-scorched monuments of departed empires; within the scent of the long\norange-groves; and where the temple of Neptune looks out over the\nsiren-haunted sea. But my eyes at least have kept their early\naffectionate joy in our native landscape, which is one deep root of our\nnational life and language.\n\nAnd I often smile at my consciousness that certain conservative\nprepossessions have mingled themselves for me with the influences of our\nmidland scenery, from the tops of the elms down to the buttercups and\nthe little wayside vetches. Naturally enough. That part of my father's\nprime to which he oftenest referred had fallen on the days when the\ngreat wave of political enthusiasm and belief in a speedy regeneration\nof all things had ebbed, and the supposed millennial initiative of\nFrance was turning into a Napoleonic empire, the sway of an Attila with\na mouth speaking proud things in a jargon half revolutionary, half\nRoman. Men were beginning to shrink timidly from the memory of their\nown words and from the recognition of the fellowships they had formed\nten years before; and even reforming Englishmen for the most part were\nwilling to wait for the perfection of society, if only they could keep\ntheir throats perfect and help to drive away the chief enemy of mankind\nfrom our coasts. To my father's mind the noisy teachers of revolutionary\ndoctrine were, to speak mildly, a variable mixture of the fool and the\nscoundrel; the welfare of the nation lay in a strong Government which\ncould maintain order; and I was accustomed to hear him utter the word\n\"Government\" in a tone that charged it with awe, and made it part of my\neffective religion, in contrast with the word \"rebel,\" which seemed to\ncarry the stamp of evil in its syllables, and, lit by the fact that\nSatan was the first rebel, made an argument dispensing with more\ndetailed inquiry. I gathered that our national troubles in the first two\ndecades of this century were not at all due to the mistakes of our\nadministrators; and that England, with its fine Church and Constitution,\nwould have been exceedingly well off if every British subject had been\nthankful for what was provided, and had minded his own business--if,\nfor example, numerous Catholics of that period had been aware how very\nmodest they ought to be considering they were Irish. The times, I heard,\nhad often been bad; but I was constantly hearing of \"bad times\" as a\nname for actual evenings and mornings when the godfathers who gave them\nthat name appeared to me remarkably comfortable. Altogether, my father's\nEngland seemed to me lovable, laudable, full of good men, and having\ngood rulers, from Mr Pitt on to the Duke of Wellington, until he was for\nemancipating the Catholics; and it was so far from prosaic to me that I\nlooked into it for a more exciting romance than such as I could find in\nmy own adventures, which consisted mainly in fancied crises calling for\nthe resolute wielding of domestic swords and firearms against unapparent\nrobbers, rioters, and invaders who, it seemed, in my father's prime had\nmore chance of being real. The morris-dancers had not then dwindled to a\nragged and almost vanished rout (owing the traditional name probably to\nthe historic fancy of our superannuated groom); also, the good old king\nwas alive and well, which made all the more difference because I had no\nnotion what he was and did--only understanding in general that if he had\nbeen still on the throne he would have hindered everything that wise\npersons thought undesirable.\n\nCertainly that elder England with its frankly saleable boroughs, so\ncheap compared with the seats obtained under the reformed method, and\nits boroughs kindly presented by noblemen desirous to encourage\ngratitude; its prisons with a miscellaneous company of felons and\nmaniacs and without any supply of water; its bloated, idle charities;\nits non-resident, jovial clergy; its militia-balloting; and above all,\nits blank ignorance of what we, its posterity, should be thinking of\nit,--has great differences from the England of to-day. Yet we discern a\nstrong family likeness. Is there any country which shows at once as much\nstability and as much susceptibility to change as ours? Our national\nlife is like that scenery which I early learned to love, not subject to\ngreat convulsions, but easily showing more or less delicate (sometimes\nmelancholy) effects from minor changes. Hence our midland plains have\nnever lost their familiar expression and conservative spirit for me;\nyet at every other mile, since I first looked on them, some sign of\nworld-wide change, some new direction of human labour has wrought itself\ninto what one may call the speech of the landscape--in contrast with\nthose grander and vaster regions of the earth which keep an indifferent\naspect in the presence of men's toil and devices. What does it signify\nthat a lilliputian train passes over a viaduct amidst the abysses of the\nApennines, or that a caravan laden with a nation's offerings creeps\nacross the unresting sameness of the desert, or that a petty cloud of\nsteam sweeps for an instant over the face of an Egyptian colossus\nimmovably submitting to its slow burial beneath the sand? But our\nwoodlands and pastures, our hedge-parted corn-fields and meadows, our\nbits of high common where we used to plant the windmills, our quiet\nlittle rivers here and there fit to turn a mill-wheel, our villages\nalong the old coach-roads, are all easily alterable lineaments that seem\nto make the face of our Motherland sympathetic with the laborious lives\nof her children. She does not take their ploughs and waggons\ncontemptuously, but rather makes every hovel and every sheepfold, every\nrailed bridge or fallen tree-trunk an agreeably noticeable incident; not\na mere speck in the midst of unmeasured vastness, but a piece of our\nsocial history in pictorial writing.\n\nOur rural tracts--where no Babel-chimney scales the heavens--are without\nmighty objects to fill the soul with the sense of an outer world\nunconquerably aloof from our efforts. The wastes are playgrounds (and\nlet us try to keep them such for the children's children who will\ninherit no other sort of demesne); the grasses and reeds nod to each\nother over the river, but we have cut a canal close by; the very heights\nlaugh with corn in August or lift the plough-team against the sky in\nSeptember. Then comes a crowd of burly navvies with pickaxes and\nbarrows, and while hardly a wrinkle is made in the fading mother's face\nor a new curve of health in the blooming girl's, the hills are cut\nthrough or the breaches between them spanned, we choose our level and\nthe white steam-pennon flies along it.\n\nBut because our land shows this readiness to be changed, all signs of\npermanence upon it raise a tender attachment instead of awe: some of us,\nat least, love the scanty relics of our forests, and are thankful if a\nbush is left of the old hedgerow. A crumbling bit of wall where the\ndelicate ivy-leaved toad-flax hangs its light branches, or a bit of grey\nthatch with patches of dark moss on its shoulder and a troop of\ngrass-stems on its ridge, is a thing to visit. And then the tiled roof\nof cottage and homestead, of the long cow-shed where generations of the\nmilky mothers have stood patiently, of the broad-shouldered barns where\nthe old-fashioned flail once made resonant music, while the watch-dog\nbarked at the timidly venturesome fowls making pecking raids on the\noutflying grain--the roofs that have looked out from among the elms and\nwalnut-trees, or beside the yearly group of hay and corn stacks, or\nbelow the square stone steeple, gathering their grey or ochre-tinted\nlichens and their olive-green mosses under all ministries,--let us\npraise the sober harmonies they give to our landscape, helping to unite\nus pleasantly with the elder generations who tilled the soil for us\nbefore we were born, and paid heavier and heavier taxes, with much\ngrumbling, but without that deepest root of corruption--the\nself-indulgent despair which cuts down and consumes and never plants.\n\nBut I check myself. Perhaps this England of my affections is half\nvisionary--a dream in which things are connected according to my\nwell-fed, lazy mood, and not at all by the multitudinous links of\ngraver, sadder fact, such as belong everywhere to the story of human\nlabour. Well, well, the illusions that began for us when we were less\nacquainted with evil have not lost their value when we discern them to\nbe illusions. They feed the ideal Better, and in loving them still, we\nstrengthen the precious habit of loving something not visibly, tangibly\nexistent, but a spiritual product of our visible tangible selves.\n\nI cherish my childish loves--the memory of that warm little nest where\nmy affections were fledged. Since then I have learned to care for\nforeign countries, for literatures foreign and ancient, for the life of\nContinental towns dozing round old cathedrals, for the life of London,\nhalf sleepless with eager thought and strife, with indigestion or with\nhunger; and now my consciousness is chiefly of the busy, anxious\nmetropolitan sort. My system responds sensitively to the London\nweather-signs, political, social, literary; and my bachelor's hearth is\nimbedded where by much craning of head and neck I can catch sight of a\nsycamore in the Square garden: I belong to the \"Nation of London.\" Why?\nThere have been many voluntary exiles in the world, and probably in the\nvery first exodus of the patriarchal Aryans--for I am determined not to\nfetch my examples from races whose talk is of uncles and no\nfathers--some of those who sallied forth went for the sake of a loved\ncompanionship, when they would willingly have kept sight of the familiar\nplains, and of the hills to which they had first lifted up their eyes.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nHOW WE ENCOURAGE RESEARCH.\n\nThe serene and beneficent goddess Truth, like other deities whose\ndisposition has been too hastily inferred from that of the men who have\ninvoked them, can hardly be well pleased with much of the worship paid\nto her even in this milder age, when the stake and the rack have ceased\nto form part of her ritual. Some cruelties still pass for service done\nin her honour: no thumb-screw is used, no iron boot, no scorching of\nflesh; but plenty of controversial bruising, laceration, and even\nlifelong maiming. Less than formerly; but so long as this sort of\ntruth-worship has the sanction of a public that can often understand\nnothing in a controversy except personal sarcasm or slanderous ridicule,\nit is likely to continue. The sufferings of its victims are often as\nlittle regarded as those of the sacrificial pig offered in old time,\nwith what we now regard as a sad miscalculation of effects.\n\nOne such victim is my old acquaintance Merman.\n\nTwenty years ago Merman was a young man of promise, a conveyancer with a\npractice which had certainly budded, but, like Aaron's rod, seemed not\ndestined to proceed further in that marvellous activity. Meanwhile he\noccupied himself in miscellaneous periodical writing and in a\nmultifarious study of moral and physical science. What chiefly attracted\nhim in all subjects were the vexed questions which have the advantage of\nnot admitting the decisive proof or disproof that renders many ingenious\narguments superannuated. Not that Merman had a wrangling disposition: he\nput all his doubts, queries, and paradoxes deferentially, contended\nwithout unpleasant heat and only with a sonorous eagerness against the\npersonality of Homer, expressed himself civilly though firmly on the\norigin of language, and had tact enough to drop at the right moment such\nsubjects as the ultimate reduction of all the so-called elementary\nsubstances, his own total scepticism concerning Manetho's chronology, or\neven the relation between the magnetic condition of the earth and the\noutbreak of revolutionary tendencies. Such flexibility was naturally\nmuch helped by his amiable feeling towards woman, whose nervous system,\nhe was convinced, would not bear the continuous strain of difficult\ntopics; and also by his willingness to contribute a song whenever the\nsame desultory charmer proposed music. Indeed his tastes were domestic\nenough to beguile him into marriage when his resources were still very\nmoderate and partly uncertain. His friends wished that so ingenious and\nagreeable a fellow might have more prosperity than they ventured to hope\nfor him, their chief regret on his account being that he did not\nconcentrate his talent and leave off forming opinions on at least\nhalf-a-dozen of the subjects over which he scattered his attention,\nespecially now that he had married a \"nice little woman\" (the generic\nname for acquaintances' wives when they are not markedly disagreeable).\nHe could not, they observed, want all his various knowledge and Laputan\nideas for his periodical writing which brought him most of his bread,\nand he would do well to use his talents in getting a speciality that\nwould fit him for a post. Perhaps these well-disposed persons were a\nlittle rash in presuming that fitness for a post would be the surest\nground for getting it; and on the whole, in now looking back on their\nwishes for Merman, their chief satisfaction must be that those wishes\ndid not contribute to the actual result.\n\nFor in an evil hour Merman did concentrate himself. He had for many\nyears taken into his interest the comparative history of the ancient\ncivilisations, but it had not preoccupied him so as to narrow his\ngenerous attention to everything else. One sleepless night, however (his\nwife has more than once narrated to me the details of an event memorable\nto her as the beginning of sorrows), after spending some hours over the\nepoch-making work of Grampus, a new idea seized him with regard to the\npossible connection of certain symbolic monuments common to widely\nscattered races. Merman started up in bed. The night was cold, and the\nsudden withdrawal of warmth made his wife first dream of a snowball,\nand then cry--\n\n\"What is the matter, Proteus?\"\n\n\"A great matter, Julia. That fellow Grampus, whose book is cried up as a\nrevelation, is all wrong about the Magicodumbras and the Zuzumotzis, and\nI have got hold of the right clue.\"\n\n\"Good gracious! does it matter so much? Don't drag the clothes, dear.\"\n\n\"It signifies this, Julia, that if I am right I shall set the world\nright; I shall regenerate history; I shall win the mind of Europe to a\nnew view of social origins; I shall bruise the head of many\nsuperstitions.\"\n\n\"Oh no, dear, don't go too far into things. Lie down again. You have\nbeen dreaming. What are the Madicojumbras and Zuzitotzums? I never heard\nyou talk of them before. What use can it be troubling yourself about\nsuch things?\"\n\n\"That is the way, Julia--that is the way wives alienate their husbands,\nand make any hearth pleasanter to him than his own!\"\n\n\"What _do_ you mean, Proteus?\"\n\n\"Why, if a woman will not try to understand her husband's ideas, or at\nleast to believe that they are of more value than she can understand--if\nshe is to join anybody who happens to be against him, and suppose he is\na fool because others contradict him--there is an end of our happiness.\nThat is all I have to say.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Proteus, dear. I do believe what you say is right That is my\nonly guide. I am sure I never have any opinions in any other way: I mean\nabout subjects. Of course there are many little things that would tease\nyou, that you like me to judge of for myself. I know I said once that I\ndid not want you to sing 'Oh ruddier than the cherry,' because it was\nnot in your voice. But I cannot remember ever differing from you about\n_subjects_. I never in my life thought any one cleverer than you.\"\n\nJulia Merman was really a \"nice little woman,\" not one of the stately\nDians sometimes spoken of in those terms. Her black _silhouette_ had a\nvery infantine aspect, but she had discernment and wisdom enough to act\non the strong hint of that memorable conversation, never again giving\nher husband the slightest ground for suspecting that she thought\ntreasonably of his ideas in relation to the Magicodumbras and\nZuzumotzis, or in the least relaxed her faith in his infallibility\nbecause Europe was not also convinced of it. It was well for her that\nshe did not increase her troubles in this way; but to do her justice,\nwhat she was chiefly anxious about was to avoid increasing her husband's\ntroubles.\n\nNot that these were great in the beginning. In the first development and\nwriting out of his scheme, Merman had a more intense kind of\nintellectual pleasure than he had ever known before. His face became\nmore radiant, his general view of human prospects more cheerful.\nForeseeing that truth as presented by himself would win the recognition\nof his contemporaries, he excused with much liberality their rather\nrough treatment of other theorists whose basis was less perfect. His own\nperiodical criticisms had never before been so amiable: he was sorry for\nthat unlucky majority whom the spirit of the age, or some other\nprompting more definite and local, compelled to write without any\nparticular ideas. The possession of an original theory which has not yet\nbeen assailed must certainly sweeten the temper of a man who is not\nbeforehand ill-natured. And Merman was the reverse of ill-natured.\n\nBut the hour of publication came; and to half-a-dozen persons, described\nas the learned world of two hemispheres, it became known that Grampus\nwas attacked. This might have been a small matter; for who or what on\nearth that is good for anything is not assailed by ignorance, stupidity,\nor malice--and sometimes even by just objection? But on examination it\nappeared that the attack might possibly be held damaging, unless the\nignorance of the author were well exposed and his pretended facts shown\nto be chimeras of that remarkably hideous kind begotten by imperfect\nlearning on the more feminine element of original incapacity. Grampus\nhimself did not immediately cut open the volume which Merman had been\ncareful to send him, not without a very lively and shifting conception\nof the possible effects which the explosive gift might produce on the\ntoo eminent scholar--effects that must certainly have set in on the\nthird day from the despatch of the parcel. But in point of fact Grampus\nknew nothing of the book until his friend Lord Narwhal sent him an\nAmerican newspaper containing a spirited article by the well-known\nProfessor Sperm N. Whale which was rather equivocal in its bearing, the\npassages quoted from Merman being of rather a telling sort, and the\nparagraphs which seemed to blow defiance being unaccountably feeble,\ncoming from so distinguished a Cetacean. Then, by another post, arrived\nletters from Butzkopf and Dugong, both men whose signatures were\nfamiliar to the Teutonic world in the _Selten-erscheinende\nMonat-schrift_ or Hayrick for the insertion of Split Hairs, asking their\nMaster whether he meant to take up the combat, because, in the contrary\ncase, both were ready.\n\nThus America and Germany were roused, though England was still drowsy,\nand it seemed time now for Grampus to find Merman's book under the heap\nand cut it open. For his own part he was perfectly at ease about his\nsystem; but this is a world in which the truth requires defence, and\nspecious falsehood must be met with exposure. Grampus having once looked\nthrough the book, no longer wanted any urging to write the most crushing\nof replies. This, and nothing less than this, was due from him to the\ncause of sound inquiry; and the punishment would cost him little pains.\nIn three weeks from that time the palpitating Merman saw his book\nannounced in the programme of the leading Review. No need for Grampus to\nput his signature. Who else had his vast yet microscopic knowledge, who\nelse his power of epithet? This article in which Merman was pilloried\nand as good as mutilated--for he was shown to have neither ear nor nose\nfor the subtleties of philological and archaeological study--was much\nread and more talked of, not because of any interest in the system of\nGrampus, or any precise conception of the danger attending lax views of\nthe Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis, but because the sharp epigrams with\nwhich the victim was lacerated, and the soaring fountains of acrid mud\nwhich were shot upward and poured over the fresh wounds, were found\namusing in recital. A favourite passage was one in which a certain kind\nof sciolist was described as a creature of the Walrus kind, having a\nphantasmal resemblance to higher animals when seen by ignorant minds in\nthe twilight, dabbling or hobbling in first one element and then the\nother, without parts or organs suited to either, in fact one of Nature's\nimpostors who could not be said to have any artful pretences, since a\ncongenital incompetence to all precision of aim and movement made their\nevery action a pretence--just as a being born in doeskin gloves would\nnecessarily pass a judgment on surfaces, but we all know what his\njudgment would be worth. In drawing-room circles, and for the immediate\nhour, this ingenious comparison was as damaging as the showing up of\nMerman's mistakes and the mere smattering of linguistic and historical\nknowledge which he had presumed to be a sufficient basis for theorising;\nbut the more learned cited his blunders aside to each other and laughed\nthe laugh of the initiated. In fact, Merman's was a remarkable case of\nsudden notoriety. In London drums and clubs he was spoken of abundantly\nas one who had written ridiculously about the Magicodumbras and\nZuzumotzis: the leaders of conversation, whether Christians, Jews,\ninfidels, or of any other confession except the confession of ignorance,\npronouncing him shallow and indiscreet if not presumptuous and absurd.\nHe was heard of at Warsaw, and even Paris took knowledge of him. M.\nCachalot had not read either Grampus or Merman, but he heard of their\ndispute in time to insert a paragraph upon it in his brilliant work,\n_L'orient au point de vue actuel_, in which he was dispassionate enough\nto speak of Grampus as possessing a _coup d'oeil presque francais_ in\nmatters of historical interpretation, and of Merman as nevertheless an\nobjector _qui merite d'etre connu_. M. Porpesse, also, availing himself\nof M. Cachalot's knowledge, reproduced it in an article with certain\nadditions, which it is only fair to distinguish as his own, implying\nthat the vigorous English of Grampus was not always as correct as a\nFrenchman could desire, while Merman's objections were more sophistical\nthan solid. Presently, indeed, there appeared an able _extrait_ of\nGrampus's article in the valuable _Rapporteur scientifique et\nhistorique_, and Merman's mistakes were thus brought under the notice of\ncertain Frenchmen who are among the masters of those who know on\noriental subjects. In a word, Merman, though not extensively read, was\nextensively read about.\n\nMeanwhile, how did he like it? Perhaps nobody, except his wife, for a\nmoment reflected on that. An amused society considered that he was\nseverely punished, but did not take the trouble to imagine his\nsensations; indeed this would have been a difficulty for persons less\nsensitive and excitable than Merman himself. Perhaps that popular\ncomparison of the Walrus had truth enough to bite and blister on\nthorough application, even if exultant ignorance had not applauded it.\nBut it is well known that the walrus, though not in the least a\nmalignant animal, if allowed to display its remarkably plain person and\nblundering performances at ease in any element it chooses, becomes\ndesperately savage and musters alarming auxiliaries when attacked or\nhurt. In this characteristic, at least, Merman resembled the walrus. And\nnow he concentrated himself with a vengeance. That his counter-theory\nwas fundamentally the right one he had a genuine conviction, whatever\ncollateral mistakes he might have committed; and his bread would not\ncease to be bitter to him until he had convinced his contemporaries that\nGrampus had used his minute learning as a dust-cloud to hide\nsophistical evasions--that, in fact, minute learning was an obstacle to\nclear-sighted judgment, more especially with regard to the Magicodumbras\nand Zuzumotzis, and that the best preparation in this matter was a wide\nsurvey of history and a diversified observation of men. Still, Merman\nwas resolved to muster all the learning within his reach, and he\nwandered day and night through many wildernesses of German print, he\ntried compendious methods of learning oriental tongues, and, so to\nspeak, getting at the marrow of languages independently of the bones,\nfor the chance of finding details to corroborate his own views, or\npossibly even to detect Grampus in some oversight or textual tampering.\nAll other work was neglected: rare clients were sent away and amazed\neditors found this maniac indifferent to his chance of getting\nbook-parcels from them. It was many months before Merman had satisfied\nhimself that he was strong enough to face round upon his adversary. But\nat last he had prepared sixty condensed pages of eager argument which\nseemed to him worthy to rank with the best models of controversial\nwriting. He had acknowledged his mistakes, but had restated his theory\nso as to show that it was left intact in spite of them; and he had even\nfound cases in which Ziphius, Microps, Scrag Whale the explorer, and\nother Cetaceans of unanswerable authority, were decidedly at issue with\nGrampus. Especially a passage cited by this last from that greatest of\nfossils Megalosaurus was demonstrated by Merman to be capable of three\ndifferent interpretations, all preferable to that chosen by Grampus, who\ntook the words in their most literal sense; for, 1 deg., the incomparable\nSaurian, alike unequalled in close observation and far-glancing\ncomprehensiveness, might have meant those words ironically; 2 deg., _motzis_\nwas probably a false reading for _potzis_, in which case its bearing was\nreversed; and 3 deg., it is known that in the age of the Saurians there\nwere conceptions about the _motzis_ which entirely remove it from the\ncategory of things comprehensible in an age when Saurians run\nridiculously small: all which views were godfathered by names quite fit\nto be ranked with that of Grampus. In fine, Merman wound up his\nrejoinder by sincerely thanking the eminent adversary without whose\nfierce assault he might not have undertaken a revision in the course of\nwhich he had met with unexpected and striking confirmations of his own\nfundamental views. Evidently Merman's anger was at white heat.\n\nThe rejoinder being complete, all that remained was to find a suitable\nmedium for its publication. This was not so easy. Distinguished mediums\nwould not lend themselves to contradictions of Grampus, or if they\nwould, Merman's article was too long and too abstruse, while he would\nnot consent to leave anything out of an article which had no\nsuperfluities; for all this happened years ago when the world was at a\ndifferent stage. At last, however, he got his rejoinder printed, and not\non hard terms, since the medium, in every sense modest, did not ask him\nto pay for its insertion.\n\nBut if Merman expected to call out Grampus again, he was mistaken.\nEverybody felt it too absurd that Merman should undertake to correct\nGrampus in matters of erudition, and an eminent man has something else\nto do than to refute a petty objector twice over. What was essential had\nbeen done: the public had been enabled to form a true judgment of\nMerman's incapacity, the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis were but\nsubsidiary elements in Grampus's system, and Merman might now be dealt\nwith by younger members of the master's school. But he had at least the\nsatisfaction of finding that he had raised a discussion which would not\nbe let die. The followers of Grampus took it up with an ardour and\nindustry of research worthy of their exemplar. Butzkopf made it the\nsubject of an elaborate _Einleitung_ to his important work, _Die\nBedeutung des Aegyptischen Labyrinthes_; and Dugong, in a remarkable\naddress which he delivered to a learned society in Central Europe,\nintroduced Merman's theory with so much power of sarcasm that it became\na theme of more or less derisive allusion to men of many tongues. Merman\nwith his Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis was on the way to become a\nproverb, being used illustratively by many able journalists who took\nthose names of questionable things to be Merman's own invention, \"than\nwhich,\" said one of the graver guides, \"we can recall few more\nmelancholy examples of speculative aberration.\" Naturally the subject\npassed into popular literature, and figured very commonly in advertised\nprogrammes. The fluent Loligo, the formidable Shark, and a younger\nmember of his remarkable family known as S. Catulus, made a special\nreputation by their numerous articles, eloquent, lively, or abusive, all\non the same theme, under titles ingeniously varied, alliterative,\nsonorous, or boldly fanciful; such as, \"Moments with Mr Merman,\" \"Mr\nMerman and the Magicodumbras,\" \"Greenland Grampus and Proteus Merman,\"\n\"Grampian Heights and their Climbers, or the New Excelsior.\" They tossed\nhim on short sentences; they swathed him in paragraphs of winding\nimagery; they found him at once a mere plagiarist and a theoriser of\nunexampled perversity, ridiculously wrong about _potzis_ and ignorant of\nPali; they hinted, indeed, at certain things which to their knowledge he\nhad silently brooded over in his boyhood, and seemed tolerably well\nassured that this preposterous attempt to gainsay an incomparable\nCetacean of world-wide fame had its origin in a peculiar mixture of\nbitterness and eccentricity which, rightly estimated and seen in its\ndefinite proportions, would furnish the best key to his argumentation.\nAll alike were sorry for Merman's lack of sound learning, but how could\ntheir readers be sorry? Sound learning would not have been amusing; and\nas it was, Merman was made to furnish these readers with amusement at no\nexpense of trouble on their part. Even burlesque writers looked into his\nbook to see where it could be made use of, and those who did not know\nhim were desirous of meeting him at dinner as one likely to feed their\ncomic vein.\n\nOn the other hand, he made a serious figure in sermons under the name of\n\"Some\" or \"Others\" who had attempted presumptuously to scale eminences\ntoo high and arduous for human ability, and had given an example of\nignominious failure edifying to the humble Christian.\n\nAll this might be very advantageous for able persons whose superfluous\nfund of expression needed a paying investment, but the effect on Merman\nhimself was unhappily not so transient as the busy writing and speaking\nof which he had become the occasion. His certainty that he was right\nnaturally got stronger in proportion as the spirit of resistance was\nstimulated. The scorn and unfairness with which he felt himself to have\nbeen treated by those really competent to appreciate his ideas had\ngalled him and made a chronic sore; and the exultant chorus of the\nincompetent seemed a pouring of vinegar on his wound. His brain became a\nregistry of the foolish and ignorant objections made against him, and of\ncontinually amplified answers to these objections. Unable to get his\nanswers printed, he had recourse to that more primitive mode of\npublication, oral transmission or button-holding, now generally regarded\nas a troublesome survival, and the once pleasant, flexible Merman was on\nthe way to be shunned as a bore. His interest in new acquaintances\nturned chiefly on the possibility that they would care about the\nMagicodumbras and Zuzumotzis; that they would listen to his complaints\nand exposures of unfairness, and not only accept copies of what he had\nwritten on the subject, but send him appreciative letters in\nacknowledgment. Repeated disappointment of such hopes tended to embitter\nhim, and not the less because after a while the fashion of mentioning\nhim died out, allusions to his theory were less understood, and people\ncould only pretend to remember it. And all the while Merman was\nperfectly sure that his very opponents who had knowledge enough to be\ncapable judges were aware that his book, whatever errors of statement\nthey might detect in it, had served as a sort of divining rod, pointing\nout hidden sources of historical interpretation; nay, his jealous\nexamination discerned in a new work by Grampus himself a certain\nshifting of ground which--so poor Merman declared--was the sign of an\nintention gradually to appropriate the views of the man he had attempted\nto brand as an ignorant impostor.\n\nAnd Julia? And the housekeeping?--the rent, food, and clothing, which\ncontroversy can hardly supply unless it be of the kind that serves as a\nrecommendation to certain posts. Controversial pamphlets have been known\nto earn large plums; but nothing of the sort could be expected from\nunpractical heresies about the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis. Painfully\nthe contrary. Merman's reputation as a sober thinker, a safe writer, a\nsound lawyer, was irretrievably injured: the distractions of controversy\nhad caused him to neglect useful editorial connections, and indeed his\ndwindling care for miscellaneous subjects made his contributions too\ndull to be desirable. Even if he could now have given a new turn to his\nconcentration, and applied his talents so as to be ready to show himself\nan exceptionally qualified lawyer, he would only have been like an\narchitect in competition, too late with his superior plans; he would not\nhave had an opportunity of showing his qualification. He was thrown out\nof the course. The small capital which had filled up deficiencies of\nincome was almost exhausted, and Julia, in the effort to make supplies\nequal to wants, had to use much ingenuity in diminishing the wants. The\nbrave and affectionate woman whose small outline, so unimpressive\nagainst an illuminated background, held within it a good share of\nfeminine heroism, did her best to keep up the charm of home and soothe\nher husband's excitement; parting with the best jewel among her wedding\npresents in order to pay rent, without ever hinting to her husband that\nthis sad result had come of his undertaking to convince people who only\nlaughed at him. She was a resigned little creature, and reflected that\nsome husbands took to drinking and others to forgery: hers had only\ntaken to the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis, and was not unkind--only a\nlittle more indifferent to her and the two children than she had ever\nexpected he would be, his mind being eaten up with \"subjects,\" and\nconstantly a little angry, not with her, but with everybody else,\nespecially those who were celebrated.\n\nThis was the sad truth. Merman felt himself ill-used by the world, and\nthought very much worse of the world in consequence. The gall of his\nadversaries' ink had been sucked into his system and ran in his blood.\nHe was still in the prime of life, but his mind was aged by that eager\nmonotonous construction which comes of feverish excitement on a single\ntopic and uses up the intellectual strength.\n\nMerman had never been a rich man, but he was now conspicuously poor, and\nin need of the friends who had power or interest which he believed they\ncould exert on his behalf. Their omitting or declining to give this help\ncould not seem to him so clearly as to them an inevitable consequence of\nhis having become impracticable, or at least of his passing for a man\nwhose views were not likely to be safe and sober. Each friend in turn\noffended him, though unwillingly, and was suspected of wishing to shake\nhim off. It was not altogether so; but poor Merman's society had\nundeniably ceased to be attractive, and it was difficult to help him. At\nlast the pressure of want urged him to try for a post far beneath his\nearlier prospects, and he gained it. He holds it still, for he has no\nvices, and his domestic life has kept up a sweetening current of motive\naround and within him. Nevertheless, the bitter flavour mingling itself\nwith all topics, the premature weariness and withering, are irrevocably\nthere. It is as if he had gone through a disease which alters what we\ncall the constitution. He has long ceased to talk eagerly of the ideas\nwhich possess him, or to attempt making proselytes. The dial has moved\nonward, and he himself sees many of his former guesses in a new light.\nOn the other hand, he has seen what he foreboded, that the main idea\nwhich was at the root of his too rash theorising has been adopted by\nGrampus and received with general respect, no reference being heard to\nthe ridiculous figure this important conception made when ushered in by\nthe incompetent \"Others.\"\n\nNow and then, on rare occasions, when a sympathetic _tete-a-tete_ has\nrestored some of his old expansiveness, he will tell a companion in a\nrailway carriage, or other place of meeting favourable to\nautobiographical confidences, what has been the course of things in his\nparticular case, as an example of the justice to be expected of the\nworld. The companion usually allows for the bitterness of a disappointed\nman, and is secretly disinclined to believe that Grampus was to blame.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nA MAN SURPRISED AT HIS ORIGINALITY.\n\nAmong the many acute sayings of La Rochefoucauld, there is hardly one\nmore acute than this: \"La plus grande ambition n'en a pas la moindre\napparence lorsqu'elle se rencontre dans une impossibilite absolue\nd'arriver ou elle aspire.\" Some of us might do well to use this hint in\nour treatment of acquaintances and friends from whom we are expecting\ngratitude because we are so very kind in thinking of them, inviting\nthem, and even listening to what they say--considering how insignificant\nthey must feel themselves to be. We are often fallaciously confident in\nsupposing that our friend's state of mind is appropriate to our moderate\nestimate of his importance: almost as if we imagined the humble mollusc\n(so useful as an illustration) to have a sense of his own exceeding\nsoftness and low place in the scale of being. Your mollusc, on the\ncontrary, is inwardly objecting to every other grade of solid rather\nthan to himself. Accustomed to observe what we think an unwarrantable\nconceit exhibiting itself in ridiculous pretensions and forwardness to\nplay the lion's part, in obvious self-complacency and loud\nperemptoriness, we are not on the alert to detect the egoistic claims of\na more exorbitant kind often hidden under an apparent neutrality or an\nacquiescence in being put out of the question.\n\nThoughts of this kind occurred to me yesterday when I saw the name of\nLentulus in the obituary. The majority of his acquaintances, I imagine,\nhave always thought of him as a man justly unpretending and as nobody's\nrival; but some of them have perhaps been struck with surprise at his\nreserve in praising the works of his contemporaries, and have now and\nthen felt themselves in need of a key to his remarks on men of celebrity\nin various departments. He was a man of fair position, deriving his\nincome from a business in which he did nothing, at leisure to frequent\nclubs and at ease in giving dinners; well-looking, polite, and generally\nacceptable in society as a part of what we may call its bread-crumb--the\nneutral basis needful for the plums and spice. Why, then, did he speak\nof the modern Maro or the modern Flaccus with a peculiarity in his tone\nof assent to other people's praise which might almost have led you to\nsuppose that the eminent poet had borrowed money of him and showed an\nindisposition to repay? He had no criticism to offer, no sign of\nobjection more specific than a slight cough, a scarcely perceptible\npause before assenting, and an air of self-control in his utterance--as\nif certain considerations had determined him not to inform against the\nso-called poet, who to his knowledge was a mere versifier. If you had\nquestioned him closely, he would perhaps have confessed that he did\nthink something better might be done in the way of Eclogues and\nGeorgics, or of Odes and Epodes, and that to his mind poetry was\nsomething very different from what had hitherto been known under that\nname.\n\nFor my own part, being of a superstitious nature, given readily to\nimagine alarming causes, I immediately, on first getting these mystic\nhints from Lentulus, concluded that he held a number of entirely\noriginal poems, or at the very least a revolutionary treatise on\npoetics, in that melancholy manuscript state to which works excelling\nall that is ever printed are necessarily condemned; and I was long timid\nin speaking of the poets when he was present. For what might not\nLentulus have done, or be profoundly aware of, that would make my\nignorant impressions ridiculous? One cannot well be sure of the negative\nin such a case, except through certain positives that bear witness to\nit; and those witnesses are not always to be got hold of. But time\nwearing on, I perceived that the attitude of Lentulus towards the\nphilosophers was essentially the same as his attitude towards the poets;\nnay, there was something so much more decided in his mode of closing his\nmouth after brief speech on the former, there was such an air of rapt\nconsciousness in his private hints as to his conviction that all\nthinking hitherto had been an elaborate mistake, and as to his own\npower of conceiving a sound basis for a lasting superstructure, that I\nbegan to believe less in the poetical stores, and to infer that the line\nof Lentulus lay rather in the rational criticism of our beliefs and in\nsystematic construction. In this case I did not figure to myself the\nexistence of formidable manuscripts ready for the press; for great\nthinkers are known to carry their theories growing within their minds\nlong before committing them to paper, and the ideas which made a new\npassion for them when their locks were jet or auburn, remain perilously\nunwritten, an inwardly developing condition of their successive selves,\nuntil the locks are grey or scanty. I only meditated improvingly on the\nway in which a man of exceptional faculties, and even carrying within\nhim some of that fierce refiner's fire which is to purge away the dross\nof human error, may move about in society totally unrecognised, regarded\nas a person whose opinion is superfluous, and only rising into a power\nin emergencies of threatened black-balling. Imagine a Descartes or a\nLocke being recognised for nothing more than a good fellow and a\nperfect gentleman--what a painful view does such a picture suggest of\nimpenetrable dulness in the society around them!\n\nI would at all times rather be reduced to a cheaper estimate of a\nparticular person, if by that means I can get a more cheerful view of my\nfellow-men generally; and I confess that in a certain curiosity which\nled me to cultivate Lentulus's acquaintance, my hope leaned to the\ndiscovery that he was a less remarkable man than he had seemed to imply.\nIt would have been a grief to discover that he was bitter or malicious,\nbut by finding him to be neither a mighty poet, nor a revolutionary\npoetical critic, nor an epoch-making philosopher, my admiration for the\npoets and thinkers whom he rated so low would recover all its buoyancy,\nand I should not be left to trust to that very suspicious sort of merit\nwhich constitutes an exception in the history of mankind, and recommends\nitself as the total abolitionist of all previous claims on our\nconfidence. You are not greatly surprised at the infirm logic of the\ncoachman who would persuade you to engage him by insisting that any\nother would be sure to rob you in the matter of hay and corn, thus\ndemanding a difficult belief in him as the sole exception from the\nfrailties of his calling; but it is rather astonishing that the\nwholesale decriers of mankind and its performances should be even more\nunwary in their reasoning than the coachman, since each of them not\nmerely confides in your regarding himself as an exception, but overlooks\nthe almost certain fact that you are wondering whether he inwardly\nexcepts _you_. Now, conscious of entertaining some common opinions which\nseemed to fall under the mildly intimated but sweeping ban of Lentulus,\nmy self-complacency was a little concerned.\n\nHence I deliberately attempted to draw out Lentulus in private dialogue,\nfor it is the reverse of injury to a man to offer him that hearing which\nhe seems to have found nowhere else. And for whatever purposes silence\nmay be equal to gold, it cannot be safely taken as an indication of\nspecific ideas. I sought to know why Lentulus was more than indifferent\nto the poets, and what was that new poetry which he had either written\nor, as to its principles, distinctly conceived. But I presently found\nthat he knew very little of any particular poet, and had a general\nnotion of poetry as the use of artificial language to express unreal\nsentiments: he instanced \"The Giaour,\" \"Lalla Rookh,\" \"The Pleasures of\nHope,\" and \"Ruin seize thee, ruthless King;\" adding, \"and plenty more.\"\nOn my observing that he probably preferred a larger, simpler style, he\nemphatically assented. \"Have you not,\" said I, \"written something of\nthat order?\" \"No; but I often compose as I go along. I see how things\nmight be written as fine as Ossian, only with true ideas. The world has\nno notion what poetry will be.\"\n\nIt was impossible to disprove this, and I am always glad to believe that\nthe poverty of our imagination is no measure of the world's resources.\nOur posterity will no doubt get fuel in ways that we are unable to\ndevise for them. But what this conversation persuaded me of was, that\nthe birth with which the mind of Lentulus was pregnant could not be\npoetry, though I did not question that he composed as he went along, and\nthat the exercise was accompanied with a great sense of power. This is a\nfrequent experience in dreams, and much of our waking experience is but\na dream in the daylight. Nay, for what I saw, the compositions might be\nfairly classed as Ossianic. But I was satisfied that Lentulus could not\ndisturb my grateful admiration for the poets of all ages by eclipsing\nthem, or by putting them under a new electric light of criticism.\n\nStill, he had himself thrown the chief emphasis of his protest and his\nconsciousness of corrective illumination on the philosophic thinking of\nour race; and his tone in assuring me that everything which had been\ndone in that way was wrong--that Plato, Robert Owen, and Dr Tuffle who\nwrote in the 'Regulator,' were all equally mistaken--gave my\nsuperstitious nature a thrill of anxiety. After what had passed about\nthe poets, it did not seem likely that Lentulus had all systems by\nheart; but who could say he had not seized that thread which may\nsomewhere hang out loosely from the web of things and be the clue of\nunravelment? We need not go far to learn that a prophet is not made by\nerudition. Lentulus at least had not the bias of a school; and if it\nturned out that he was in agreement with any celebrated thinker,\nancient or modern, the agreement would have the value of an undesigned\ncoincidence not due to forgotten reading. It was therefore with renewed\ncuriosity that I engaged him on this large subject--the universal\nerroneousness of thinking up to the period when Lentulus began that\nprocess. And here I found him more copious than on the theme of poetry.\nHe admitted that he did contemplate writing down his thoughts, but his\ndifficulty was their abundance. Apparently he was like the woodcutter\nentering the thick forest and saying, \"Where shall I begin?\" The same\nobstacle appeared in a minor degree to cling about his verbal\nexposition, and accounted perhaps for his rather helter-skelter choice\nof remarks bearing on the number of unaddressed letters sent to the\npost-office; on what logic really is, as tending to support the buoyancy\nof human mediums and mahogany tables; on the probability of all miracles\nunder all religions when explained by hidden laws, and my\nunreasonableness in supposing that their profuse occurrence at half a\nguinea an hour in recent times was anything more than a coincidence; on\nthe haphazard way in which marriages are determined--showing the\nbaselessness of social and moral schemes; and on his expectation that he\nshould offend the scientific world when he told them what he thought of\nelectricity as an agent.\n\nNo man's appearance could be graver or more gentleman-like than that of\nLentulus as we walked along the Mall while he delivered these\nobservations, understood by himself to have a regenerative bearing on\nhuman society. His wristbands and black gloves, his hat and nicely\nclipped hair, his laudable moderation in beard, and his evident\ndiscrimination in choosing his tailor, all seemed to excuse the\nprevalent estimate of him as a man untainted with heterodoxy, and likely\nto be so unencumbered with opinions that he would always be useful as an\nassenting and admiring listener. Men of science seeing him at their\nlectures doubtless flattered themselves that he came to learn from them;\nthe philosophic ornaments of our time, expounding some of their luminous\nideas in the social circle, took the meditative gaze of Lentulus for one\nof surprise not unmixed with a just reverence at such close reasoning\ntowards so novel a conclusion; and those who are called men of the\nworld considered him a good fellow who might be asked to vote for a\nfriend of their own and would have no troublesome notions to make him\nunaccommodating. You perceive how very much they were all mistaken,\nexcept in qualifying him as a good fellow.\n\nThis Lentulus certainly was, in the sense of being free from envy,\nhatred, and malice; and such freedom was all the more remarkable an\nindication of native benignity, because of his gaseous, illimitably\nexpansive conceit. Yes, conceit; for that his enormous and contentedly\nignorant confidence in his own rambling thoughts was usually clad in a\ndecent silence, is no reason why it should be less strictly called by\nthe name directly implying a complacent self-estimate unwarranted by\nperformance. Nay, the total privacy in which he enjoyed his\nconsciousness of inspiration was the very condition of its undisturbed\nplacid nourishment and gigantic growth. Your audibly arrogant man\nexposes himself to tests: in attempting to make an impression on others\nhe may possibly (not always) be made to feel his own lack of\ndefiniteness; and the demand for definiteness is to all of us a needful\ncheck on vague depreciation of what others do, and vague ecstatic trust\nin our own superior ability. But Lentulus was at once so unreceptive,\nand so little gifted with the power of displaying his miscellaneous\ndeficiency of information, that there was really nothing to hinder his\nastonishment at the spontaneous crop of ideas which his mind secretly\nyielded. If it occurred to him that there were more meanings than one\nfor the word \"motive,\" since it sometimes meant the end aimed at and\nsometimes the feeling that prompted the aiming, and that the word\n\"cause\" was also of changeable import, he was naturally struck with the\ntruth of his own perception, and was convinced that if this vein were\nwell followed out much might be made of it. Men were evidently in the\nwrong about cause and effect, else why was society in the confused state\nwe behold? And as to motive, Lentulus felt that when he came to write\ndown his views he should look deeply into this kind of subject and show\nup thereby the anomalies of our social institutions; meanwhile the\nvarious aspects of \"motive\" and \"cause\" flitted about among the motley\ncrowd of ideas which he regarded as original, and pregnant with\nreformative efficacy. For his unaffected goodwill made him regard all\nhis insight as only valuable because it tended towards reform.\n\nThe respectable man had got into his illusory maze of discoveries by\nletting go that clue of conformity in his thinking which he had kept\nfast hold of in his tailoring and manners. He regarded heterodoxy as a\npower in itself, and took his inacquaintance with doctrines for a\ncreative dissidence. But his epitaph needs not to be a melancholy one.\nHis benevolent disposition was more effective for good than his silent\npresumption for harm. He might have been mischievous but for the lack of\nwords: instead of being astonished at his inspirations in private, he\nmight have clad his addled originalities, disjointed commonplaces, blind\ndenials, and balloon-like conclusions, in that mighty sort of language\nwhich would have made a new Koran for a knot of followers. I mean no\ndisrespect to the ancient Koran, but one would not desire the roc to lay\nmore eggs and give us a whole wing-flapping brood to soar and make\ntwilight.\n\nPeace be with Lentulus, for he has left us in peace. Blessed is the man\nwho, having nothing to say, abstains from giving us wordy evidence of\nthe fact--from calling on us to look through a heap of millet-seed in\norder to be sure that there is no pearl in it.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nA TOO DEFERENTIAL MAN.\n\nA little unpremeditated insincerity must be indulged under the stress of\nsocial intercourse. The talk even of an honest man must often represent\nmerely his wish to be inoffensive or agreeable rather than his genuine\nopinion or feeling on the matter in hand. His thought, if uttered, might\nbe wounding; or he has not the ability to utter it with exactness and\nsnatches at a loose paraphrase; or he has really no genuine thought on\nthe question and is driven to fill up the vacancy by borrowing the\nremarks in vogue. These are the winds and currents we have all to steer\namongst, and they are often too strong for our truthfulness or our wit.\nLet us not bear too hardly on each other for this common incidental\nfrailty, or think that we rise superior to it by dropping all\nconsiderateness and deference.\n\nBut there are studious, deliberate forms of insincerity which it is fair\nto be impatient with: Hinze's, for example. From his name you might\nsuppose him to be German: in fact, his family is Alsatian, but has been\nsettled in England for more than one generation. He is the superlatively\ndeferential man, and walks about with murmured wonder at the wisdom and\ndiscernment of everybody who talks to him. He cultivates the low-toned\n_tete-a-tete,_ keeping his hat carefully in his hand and often stroking\nit, while he smiles with downcast eyes, as if to relieve his feelings\nunder the pressure of the remarkable conversation which it is his honour\nto enjoy at the present moment. I confess to some rage on hearing him\nyesterday talking to Felicia, who is certainly a clever woman, and,\nwithout any unusual desire to show her cleverness, occasionally says\nsomething of her own or makes an allusion which is not quite common.\nStill, it must happen to her as to every one else to speak of many\nsubjects on which the best things were said long ago, and in\nconversation with a person who has been newly introduced those\nwell-worn themes naturally recur as a further development of salutations\nand preliminary media of understanding, such as pipes, chocolate, or\nmastic-chewing, which serve to confirm the impression that our new\nacquaintance is on a civilised footing and has enough regard for\nformulas to save us from shocking outbursts of individualism, to which\nwe are always exposed with the tamest bear or baboon. Considered purely\nas a matter of information, it cannot any longer be important for us to\nlearn that a British subject included in the last census holds Shakspere\nto be supreme in the presentation of character; still, it is as\nadmissible for any one to make this statement about himself as to rub\nhis hands and tell you that the air is brisk, if only he will let it\nfall as a matter of course, with a parenthetic lightness, and not\nannounce his adhesion to a commonplace with an emphatic insistance, as\nif it were a proof of singular insight. We mortals should chiefly like\nto talk to each other out of goodwill and fellowship, not for the sake\nof hearing revelations or being stimulated by witticisms; and I have\nusually found that it is the rather dull person who appears to be\ndisgusted with his contemporaries because they are not always strikingly\noriginal, and to satisfy whom the party at a country house should have\nincluded the prophet Isaiah, Plato, Francis Bacon, and Voltaire. It is\nalways your heaviest bore who is astonished at the tameness of modern\ncelebrities: naturally; for a little of his company has reduced them to\na state of flaccid fatigue. It is right and meet that there should be an\nabundant utterance of good sound commonplaces. Part of an agreeable\ntalker's charm is that he lets them fall continually with no more than\ntheir due emphasis. Giving a pleasant voice to what we are all well\nassured of, makes a sort of wholesome air for more special and dubious\nremark to move in.\n\nHence it seemed to me far from unbecoming in Felicia that in her first\ndialogue with Hinze, previously quite a stranger to her, her\nobservations were those of an ordinarily refined and well-educated woman\non standard subjects, and might have been printed in a manual of polite\ntopics and creditable opinions. She had no desire to astonish a man of\nwhom she had heard nothing particular. It was all the more exasperating\nto see and hear Hinze's reception of her well-bred conformities.\nFelicia's acquaintances know her as the suitable wife of a distinguished\nman, a sensible, vivacious, kindly-disposed woman, helping her husband\nwith graceful apologies written and spoken, and making her receptions\nagreeable to all comers. But you would have imagined that Hinze had been\nprepared by general report to regard this introduction to her as an\nopportunity comparable to an audience of the Delphic Sibyl. When she had\ndelivered herself on the changes in Italian travel, on the difficulty of\nreading Ariosto in these busy times, on the want of equilibrium in\nFrench political affairs, and on the pre-eminence of German music, he\nwould know what to think. Felicia was evidently embarrassed by his\nreverent wonder, and, in dread lest she should seem to be playing the\noracle, became somewhat confused, stumbling on her answers rather than\nchoosing them. But this made no difference to Hinze's rapt attention and\nsubdued eagerness of inquiry. He continued to put large questions,\nbending his head slightly that his eyes might be a little lifted in\nawaiting her reply.\n\n\"What, may I ask, is your opinion as to the state of Art in England?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Felicia, with a light deprecatory laugh, \"I think it suffers\nfrom two diseases--bad taste in the patrons and want of inspiration in\nthe artists.\"\n\n\"That is true indeed,\" said Hinze, in an undertone of deep conviction.\n\"You have put your finger with strict accuracy on the causes of decline.\nTo a cultivated taste like yours this must be particularly painful.\"\n\n\"I did not say there was actual decline,\" said Felicia, with a touch of\n_brusquerie_. \"I don't set myself up as the great personage whom nothing\ncan please.\"\n\n\"That would be too severe a misfortune for others,\" says my\ncomplimentary ape. \"You approve, perhaps, of Rosemary's 'Babes in the\nWood,' as something fresh and _naive_ in sculpture?\"\n\n\"I think it enchanting.\"\n\n\"Does he know that? Or _will_ you permit me to tell him?\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid! It would be an impertinence in me to praise a work of\nhis--to pronounce on its quality; and that I happen to like it can be of\nno consequence to him.\"\n\nHere was an occasion for Hinze to smile down on his hat and stroke\nit--Felicia's ignorance that her praise was inestimable being peculiarly\nnoteworthy to an observer of mankind. Presently he was quite sure that\nher favourite author was Shakspere, and wished to know what she thought\nof Hamlet's madness. When she had quoted Wilhelm Meister on this point,\nand had afterwards testified that \"Lear\" was beyond adequate\npresentation, that \"Julius Caesar\" was an effective acting play, and\nthat a poet may know a good deal about human nature while knowing little\nof geography, Hinze appeared so impressed with the plenitude of these\nrevelations that he recapitulated them, weaving them together with\nthreads of compliment--\"As you very justly observed;\" and--\"It is most\ntrue, as you say;\" and--\"It were well if others noted what you have\nremarked.\"\n\nSome listeners incautious in their epithets would have called Hinze an\n\"ass.\" For my part I would never insult that intelligent and\nunpretending animal who no doubt brays with perfect simplicity and\nsubstantial meaning to those acquainted with his idiom, and if he feigns\nmore submission than he feels, has weighty reasons for doing so--I would\nnever, I say, insult that historic and ill-appreciated animal, the ass,\nby giving his name to a man whose continuous pretence is so shallow in\nits motive, so unexcused by any sharp appetite as this of Hinze's.\n\nBut perhaps you would say that his adulatory manner was originally\nadopted under strong promptings of self-interest, and that his absurdly\nover-acted deference to persons from whom he expects no patronage is the\nunreflecting persistence of habit--just as those who live with the deaf\nwill shout to everybody else.\n\nAnd you might indeed imagine that in talking to Tulpian, who has\nconsiderable interest at his disposal, Hinze had a desired appointment\nin his mind. Tulpian is appealed to on innumerable subjects, and if he\nis unwilling to express himself on any one of them, says so with\ninstructive copiousness: he is much listened to, and his utterances are\nregistered and reported with more or less exactitude. But I think he\nhas no other listener who comports himself as Hinze does--who,\nfiguratively speaking, carries about a small spoon ready to pick up any\ndusty crumb of opinion that the eloquent man may have let drop. Tulpian,\nwith reverence be it said, has some rather absurd notions, such as a\nmind of large discourse often finds room for: they slip about among his\nhigher conceptions and multitudinous acquirements like disreputable\ncharacters at a national celebration in some vast cathedral, where to\nthe ardent soul all is glorified by rainbow light and grand\nassociations: any vulgar detective knows them for what they are. But\nHinze is especially fervid in his desire to hear Tulpian dilate on his\ncrotchets, and is rather troublesome to bystanders in asking them\nwhether they have read the various fugitive writings in which these\ncrotchets have been published. If an expert is explaining some matter on\nwhich you desire to know the evidence, Hinze teases you with Tulpian's\nguesses, and asks the expert what he thinks of them.\n\nIn general, Hinze delights in the citation of opinions, and would\nhardly remark that the sun shone without an air of respectful appeal or\nfervid adhesion. The 'Iliad,' one sees, would impress him little if it\nwere not for what Mr Fugleman has lately said about it; and if you\nmention an image or sentiment in Chaucer he seems not to heed the\nbearing of your reference, but immediately tells you that Mr Hautboy,\ntoo, regards Chaucer as a poet of the first order, and he is delighted\nto find that two such judges as you and Hautboy are at one.\n\nWhat is the reason of all this subdued ecstasy, moving about, hat in\nhand, with well-dressed hair and attitudes of unimpeachable correctness?\nSome persons conscious of sagacity decide at once that Hinze knows what\nhe is about in flattering Tulpian, and has a carefully appraised end to\nserve though they may not see it They are misled by the common mistake\nof supposing that men's behaviour, whether habitual or occasional, is\nchiefly determined by a distinctly conceived motive, a definite object\nto be gained or a definite evil to be avoided. The truth is, that, the\nprimitive wants of nature once tolerably satisfied, the majority of\nmankind, even in a civilised life full of solicitations, are with\ndifficulty aroused to the distinct conception of an object towards which\nthey will direct their actions with careful adaptation, and it is yet\nrarer to find one who can persist in the systematic pursuit of such an\nend. Few lives are shaped, few characters formed, by the contemplation\nof definite consequences seen from a distance and made the goal of\ncontinuous effort or the beacon of a constantly avoided danger: such\ncontrol by foresight, such vivid picturing and practical logic are the\ndistinction of exceptionally strong natures; but society is chiefly made\nup of human beings whose daily acts are all performed either in\nunreflecting obedience to custom and routine or from immediate\npromptings of thought or feeling to execute an immediate purpose. They\npay their poor-rates, give their vote in affairs political or parochial,\nwear a certain amount of starch, hinder boys from tormenting the\nhelpless, and spend money on tedious observances called pleasures,\nwithout mentally adjusting these practices to their own well-understood\ninterest or to the general, ultimate welfare of the human race; and when\nthey fall into ungraceful compliment, excessive smiling or other\nluckless efforts of complaisant behaviour, these are but the tricks or\nhabits gradually formed under the successive promptings of a wish to be\nagreeable, stimulated day by day without any widening resources for\ngratifying the wish. It does not in the least follow that they are\nseeking by studied hypocrisy to get something for themselves. And so\nwith Hinze's deferential bearing, complimentary parentheses, and\nworshipful tones, which seem to some like the over-acting of a part in a\ncomedy. He expects no appointment or other appreciable gain through\nTulpian's favour; he has no doubleness towards Felicia; there is no\nsneering or backbiting obverse to his ecstatic admiration. He is very\nwell off in the world, and cherishes no unsatisfied ambition that could\nfeed design and direct flattery. As you perceive, he has had the\neducation and other advantages of a gentleman without being conscious of\nmarked result, such as a decided preference for any particular ideas or\nfunctions: his mind is furnished as hotels are, with everything for\noccasional and transient use. But one cannot be an Englishman and\ngentleman in general: it is in the nature of things that one must have\nan individuality, though it may be of an often-repeated type. As Hinze\nin growing to maturity had grown into a particular form and expression\nof person, so he necessarily gathered a manner and frame of speech which\nmade him additionally recognisable. His nature is not tuned to the pitch\nof a genuine direct admiration, only to an attitudinising deference\nwhich does not fatigue itself with the formation of real judgments. All\nhuman achievement must be wrought down to this spoon-meat--this mixture\nof other persons' washy opinions and his own flux of reverence for what\nis third-hand, before Hinze can find a relish for it.\n\nHe has no more leading characteristic than the desire to stand well with\nthose who are justly distinguished; he has no base admirations, and you\nmay know by his entire presentation of himself, from the management of\nhis hat to the angle at which he keeps his right foot, that he aspires\nto correctness. Desiring to behave becomingly and also to make a figure\nin dialogue, he is only like the bad artist whose picture is a failure.\nWe may pity these ill-gifted strivers, but not pretend that their works\nare pleasant to behold. A man is bound to know something of his own\nweight and muscular dexterity, and the puny athlete is called foolish\nbefore he is seen to be thrown. Hinze has not the stuff in him to be at\nonce agreeably conversational and sincere, and he has got himself up to\nbe at all events agreeably conversational. Notwithstanding this\ndeliberateness of intention in his talk he is unconscious of falsity,\nfor he has not enough of deep and lasting impression to find a contrast\nor diversity between his words and his thoughts. He is not fairly to be\ncalled a hypocrite, but I have already confessed to the more\nexasperation at his make-believe reverence, because it has no deep\nhunger to excuse it.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nONLY TEMPER.\n\nWhat is temper? Its primary meaning, the proportion and mode in which\nqualities are mingled, is much neglected in popular speech, yet even\nhere the word often carries a reference to an habitual state or general\ntendency of the organism in distinction from what are held to be\nspecific virtues and vices. As people confess to bad memory without\nexpecting to sink in mental reputation, so we hear a man declared to\nhave a bad temper and yet glorified as the possessor of every high\nquality. When he errs or in any way commits himself, his temper is\naccused, not his character, and it is understood that but for a brutal\nbearish mood he is kindness itself. If he kicks small animals, swears\nviolently at a servant who mistakes orders, or is grossly rude to his\nwife, it is remarked apologetically that these things mean nothing--they\nare all temper.\n\nCertainly there is a limit to this form of apology, and the forgery of a\nbill, or the ordering of goods without any prospect of paying for them,\nhas never been set down to an unfortunate habit of sulkiness or of\nirascibility. But on the whole there is a peculiar exercise of\nindulgence towards the manifestations of bad temper which tends to\nencourage them, so that we are in danger of having among us a number of\nvirtuous persons who conduct themselves detestably, just as we have\nhysterical patients who, with sound organs, are apparently labouring\nunder many sorts of organic disease. Let it be admitted, however, that a\nman may be \"a good fellow\" and yet have a bad temper, so bad that we\nrecognise his merits with reluctance, and are inclined to resent his\noccasionally amiable behaviour as an unfair demand on our admiration.\n\nTouchwood is that kind of good fellow. He is by turns insolent,\nquarrelsome, repulsively haughty to innocent people who approach him\nwith respect, neglectful of his friends, angry in face of legitimate\ndemands, procrastinating in the fulfilment of such demands, prompted to\nrude words and harsh looks by a moody disgust with his fellow-men in\ngeneral--and yet, as everybody will assure you, the soul of honour, a\nsteadfast friend, a defender of the oppressed, an affectionate-hearted\ncreature. Pity that, after a certain experience of his moods, his\nintimacy becomes insupportable! A man who uses his balmorals to tread on\nyour toes with much frequency and an unmistakeable emphasis may prove a\nfast friend in adversity, but meanwhile your adversity has not arrived\nand your toes are tender. The daily sneer or growl at your remarks is\nnot to be made amends for by a possible eulogy or defence of your\nunderstanding against depredators who may not present themselves, and on\nan occasion which may never arise. I cannot submit to a chronic state of\nblue and green bruise as a form of insurance against an accident.\n\nTouchwood's bad temper is of the contradicting pugnacious sort. He is\nthe honourable gentleman in opposition, whatever proposal or proposition\nmay be broached, and when others join him he secretly damns their\nsuperfluous agreement, quickly discovering that his way of stating the\ncase is not exactly theirs. An invitation or any sign of expectation\nthrows him into an attitude of refusal. Ask his concurrence in a\nbenevolent measure: he will not decline to give it, because he has a\nreal sympathy with good aims; but he complies resentfully, though where\nhe is let alone he will do much more than any one would have thought of\nasking for. No man would shrink with greater sensitiveness from the\nimputation of not paying his debts, yet when a bill is sent in with any\npromptitude he is inclined to make the tradesman wait for the money he\nis in such a hurry to get. One sees that this antagonistic temper must\nbe much relieved by finding a particular object, and that its worst\nmoments must be those where the mood is that of vague resistance, there\nbeing nothing specific to oppose. Touchwood is never so little engaging\nas when he comes down to breakfast with a cloud on his brow, after\nparting from you the night before with an affectionate effusiveness at\nthe end of a confidential conversation which has assured you of mutual\nunderstanding. Impossible that you can have committed any offence. If\nmice have disturbed him, that is not your fault; but, nevertheless, your\ncheerful greeting had better not convey any reference to the weather,\nelse it will be met by a sneer which, taking you unawares, may give you\na crushing sense that you make a poor figure with your cheerfulness,\nwhich was not asked for. Some daring person perhaps introduces another\ntopic, and uses the delicate flattery of appealing to Touchwood for his\nopinion, the topic being included in his favourite studies. An\nindistinct muttering, with a look at the carving-knife in reply, teaches\nthat daring person how ill he has chosen a market for his deference. If\nTouchwood's behaviour affects you very closely you had better break your\nleg in the course of the day: his bad temper will then vanish at once;\nhe will take a painful journey on your behalf; he will sit up with you\nnight after night; he will do all the work of your department so as to\nsave you from any loss in consequence of your accident; he will be even\nuniformly tender to you till you are well on your legs again, when he\nwill some fine morning insult you without provocation, and make you wish\nthat his generous goodness to you had not closed your lips against\nretort.\n\nIt is not always necessary that a friend should break his leg for\nTouchwood to feel compunction and endeavour to make amends for his\nbearishness or insolence. He becomes spontaneously conscious that he has\nmisbehaved, and he is not only ashamed of himself, but has the better\nprompting to try and heal any wound he has inflicted. Unhappily the\nhabit of being offensive \"without meaning it\" leads usually to a way of\nmaking amends which the injured person cannot but regard as a being\namiable without meaning it. The kindnesses, the complimentary\nindications or assurances, are apt to appear in the light of a penance\nadjusted to the foregoing lapses, and by the very contrast they offer\ncall up a keener memory of the wrong they atone for. They are not a\nspontaneous prompting of goodwill, but an elaborate compensation. And,\nin fact, Dion's atoning friendliness has a ring of artificiality.\nBecause he formerly disguised his good feeling towards you he now\nexpresses more than he quite feels. It is in vain. Having made you\nextremely uncomfortable last week he has absolutely diminished his\npower of making you happy to-day: he struggles against this result by\nexcessive effort, but he has taught you to observe his fitfulness rather\nthan to be warmed by his episodic show of regard.\n\nI suspect that many persons who have an uncertain, incalculable temper\nflatter themselves that it enhances their fascination; but perhaps they\nare under the prior mistake of exaggerating the charm which they suppose\nto be thus strengthened; in any case they will do well not to trust in\nthe attractions of caprice and moodiness for a long continuance or for\nclose intercourse. A pretty woman may fan the flame of distant adorers\nby harassing them, but if she lets one of them make her his wife, the\npoint of view from which he will look at her poutings and tossings and\nmysterious inability to be pleased will be seriously altered. And if\nslavery to a pretty woman, which seems among the least conditional forms\nof abject service, will not bear too great a strain from her bad temper\neven though her beauty remain the same, it is clear that a man whose\nclaims lie in his high character or high performances had need impress\nus very constantly with his peculiar value and indispensableness, if he\nis to test our patience by an uncertainty of temper which leaves us\nabsolutely without grounds for guessing how he will receive our persons\nor humbly advanced opinions, or what line he will take on any but the\nmost momentous occasions.\n\nFor it is among the repulsive effects of this bad temper, which is\nsupposed to be compatible with shining virtues, that it is apt to\ndetermine a man's sudden adhesion to an opinion, whether on a personal\nor impersonal matter, without leaving him time to consider his grounds.\nThe adhesion is sudden and momentary, but it either forms a precedent\nfor his line of thought and action, or it is presently seen to have been\ninconsistent with his true mind. This determination of partisanship by\ntemper has its worst effects in the career of the public man, who is\nalways in danger of getting so enthralled by his own words that he looks\ninto facts and questions not to get rectifying knowledge, but to get\nevidence that will justify his actual attitude which was assumed under\nan impulse dependent on something else than knowledge. There has been\nplenty of insistance on the evil of swearing by the words of a master,\nand having the judgment uniformly controlled by a \"He said it;\" but a\nmuch worse woe to befall a man is to have every judgment controlled by\nan \"I said it\"--to make a divinity of his own short-sightedness or\npassion-led aberration and explain the world in its honour. There is\nhardly a more pitiable degradation than this for a man of high gifts.\nHence I cannot join with those who wish that Touchwood, being young\nenough to enter on public life, should get elected for Parliament and\nuse his excellent abilities to serve his country in that conspicuous\nmanner. For hitherto, in the less momentous incidents of private life,\nhis capricious temper has only produced the minor evil of inconsistency,\nand he is even greatly at ease in contradicting himself, provided he can\ncontradict you, and disappoint any smiling expectation you may have\nshown that the impressions you are uttering are likely to meet with his\nsympathy, considering that the day before he himself gave you the\nexample which your mind is following. He is at least free from those\nfetters of self-justification which are the curse of parliamentary\nspeaking, and what I rather desire for him is that he should produce the\ngreat book which he is generally pronounced capable of writing, and put\nhis best self imperturbably on record for the advantage of society;\nbecause I should then have steady ground for bearing with his diurnal\nincalculableness, and could fix my gratitude as by a strong staple to\nthat unvarying monumental service. Unhappily, Touchwood's great powers\nhave been only so far manifested as to be believed in, not demonstrated.\nEverybody rates them highly, and thinks that whatever he chose to do\nwould be done in a first-rate manner. Is it his love of disappointing\ncomplacent expectancy which has gone so far as to keep up this\nlamentable negation, and made him resolve not to write the comprehensive\nwork which he would have written if nobody had expected it of him?\n\nOne can see that if Touchwood were to become a public man and take to\nfrequent speaking on platforms or from his seat in the House, it would\nhardly be possible for him to maintain much integrity of opinion, or to\navoid courses of partisanship which a healthy public sentiment would\nstamp with discredit. Say that he were endowed with the purest honesty,\nit would inevitably be dragged captive by this mysterious, Protean bad\ntemper. There would be the fatal public necessity of justifying\noratorical Temper which had got on its legs in its bitter mood and made\ninsulting imputations, or of keeping up some decent show of consistency\nwith opinions vented out of Temper's contradictoriness. And words would\nhave to be followed up by acts of adhesion.\n\nCertainly if a bad-tempered man can be admirably virtuous, he must be so\nunder extreme difficulties. I doubt the possibility that a high order of\ncharacter can coexist with a temper like Touchwood's. For it is of the\nnature of such temper to interrupt the formation of healthy mental\nhabits, which depend on a growing harmony between perception,\nconviction, and impulse. There may be good feelings, good deeds--for a\nhuman nature may pack endless varieties and blessed inconsistencies in\nits windings--but it is essential to what is worthy to be called high\ncharacter, that it may be safely calculated on, and that its qualities\nshall have taken the form of principles or laws habitually, if not\nperfectly, obeyed.\n\nIf a man frequently passes unjust judgments, takes up false attitudes,\nintermits his acts of kindness with rude behaviour or cruel words, and\nfalls into the consequent vulgar error of supposing that he can make\namends by laboured agreeableness, I cannot consider such courses any the\nless ugly because they are ascribed to \"temper.\" Especially I object to\nthe assumption that his having a fundamentally good disposition is\neither an apology or a compensation for his bad behaviour. If his temper\nyesterday made him lash the horses, upset the curricle and cause a\nbreakage in my rib, I feel it no compensation that to-day he vows he\nwill drive me anywhere in the gentlest manner any day as long as he\nlives. Yesterday was what it was, my rib is paining me, it is not a main\nobject of my life to be driven by Touchwood--and I have no confidence in\nhis lifelong gentleness. The utmost form of placability I am capable of\nis to try and remember his better deeds already performed, and, mindful\nof my own offences, to bear him no malice. But I cannot accept his\namends.\n\nIf the bad-tempered man wants to apologise he had need to do it on a\nlarge public scale, make some beneficent discovery, produce some\nstimulating work of genius, invent some powerful process--prove himself\nsuch a good to contemporary multitudes and future generations, as to\nmake the discomfort he causes his friends and acquaintances a vanishing\nquality, a trifle even in their own estimate.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nA POLITICAL MOLECULE.\n\nThe most arrant denier must admit that a man often furthers larger ends\nthan he is conscious of, and that while he is transacting his particular\naffairs with the narrow pertinacity of a respectable ant, he subserves\nan economy larger than any purpose of his own. Society is happily not\ndependent for the growth of fellowship on the small minority already\nendowed with comprehensive sympathy: any molecule of the body politic\nworking towards his own interest in an orderly way gets his\nunderstanding more or less penetrated with the fact that his interest is\nincluded in that of a large number. I have watched several political\nmolecules being educated in this way by the nature of things into a\nfaint feeling of fraternity. But at this moment I am thinking of Spike,\nan elector who voted on the side of Progress though he was not inwardly\nattached to it under that name. For abstractions are deities having many\nspecific names, local habitations, and forms of activity, and so get a\nmultitude of devout servants who care no more for them under their\nhighest titles than the celebrated person who, putting with forcible\nbrevity a view of human motives now much insisted on, asked what\nPosterity had done for him that he should care for Posterity? To many\nminds even among the ancients (thought by some to have been invariably\npoetical) the goddess of wisdom was doubtless worshipped simply as the\npatroness of spinning and weaving. Now spinning and weaving from a\nmanufacturing, wholesale point of view, was the chief form under which\nSpike from early years had unconsciously been a devotee of Progress.\n\nHe was a political molecule of the most gentleman-like appearance, not\nless than six feet high, and showing the utmost nicety in the care of\nhis person and equipment. His umbrella was especially remarkable for its\nneatness, though perhaps he swung it unduly in walking. His complexion\nwas fresh, his eyes small, bright, and twinkling. He was seen to great\nadvantage in a hat and greatcoat--garments frequently fatal to the\nimpressiveness of shorter figures; but when he was uncovered in the\ndrawing-room, it was impossible not to observe that his head shelved off\ntoo rapidly from the eyebrows towards the crown, and that his length of\nlimb seemed to have used up his mind so as to cause an air of\nabstraction from conversational topics. He appeared, indeed, to be\npreoccupied with a sense of his exquisite cleanliness, clapped his hands\ntogether and rubbed them frequently, straightened his back, and even\nopened his mouth and closed it again with a slight snap, apparently for\nno other purpose than the confirmation to himself of his own powers in\nthat line. These are innocent exercises, but they are not such as give\nweight to a man's personality. Sometimes Spike's mind, emerging from its\npreoccupation, burst forth in a remark delivered with smiling zest; as,\nthat he did like to see gravel walks well rolled, or that a lady should\nalways wear the best jewellery, or that a bride was a most interesting\nobject; but finding these ideas received rather coldly, he would relapse\ninto abstraction, draw up his back, wrinkle his brows longitudinally,\nand seem to regard society, even including gravel walks, jewellery, and\nbrides, as essentially a poor affair. Indeed his habit of mind was\ndesponding, and he took melancholy views as to the possible extent of\nhuman pleasure and the value of existence. Especially after he had made\nhis fortune in the cotton manufacture, and had thus attained the chief\nobject of his ambition--the object which had engaged his talent for\norder and persevering application. For his easy leisure caused him much\n_ennui_. He was abstemious, and had none of those temptations to sensual\nexcess which fill up a man's time first with indulgence and then with\nthe process of getting well from its effects. He had not, indeed,\nexhausted the sources of knowledge, but here again his notions of human\npleasure were narrowed by his want of appetite; for though he seemed\nrather surprised at the consideration that Alfred the Great was a\nCatholic, or that apart from the Ten Commandments any conception of\nmoral conduct had occurred to mankind, he was not stimulated to further\ninquiries on these remote matters. Yet he aspired to what he regarded as\nintellectual society, willingly entertained beneficed clergymen, and\nbought the books he heard spoken of, arranging them carefully on the\nshelves of what he called his library, and occasionally sitting alone in\nthe same room with them. But some minds seem well glazed by nature\nagainst the admission of knowledge, and Spike's was one of them. It was\nnot, however, entirely so with regard to politics. He had had a strong\nopinion about the Reform Bill, and saw clearly that the large trading\ntowns ought to send members. Portraits of the Reform heroes hung framed\nand glazed in his library: he prided himself on being a Liberal. In this\nlast particular, as well as in not giving benefactions and not making\nloans without interest, he showed unquestionable firmness. On the Repeal\nof the Corn Laws, again, he was thoroughly convinced. His mind was\nexpansive towards foreign markets, and his imagination could see that\nthe people from whom we took corn might be able to take the cotton goods\nwhich they had hitherto dispensed with. On his conduct in these\npolitical concerns, his wife, otherwise influential as a woman who\nbelonged to a family with a title in it, and who had condescended in\nmarrying him, could gain no hold: she had to blush a little at what was\ncalled her husband's \"radicalism\"--an epithet which was a very unfair\nimpeachment of Spike, who never went to the root of anything. But he\nunderstood his own trading affairs, and in this way became a genuine,\nconstant political element. If he had been born a little later he could\nhave been accepted as an eligible member of Parliament, and if he had\nbelonged to a high family he might have done for a member of the\nGovernment. Perhaps his indifference to \"views\" would have passed for\nadministrative judiciousness, and he would have been so generally silent\nthat he must often have been silent in the right place. But this is\nempty speculation: there is no warrant for saying what Spike would have\nbeen and known so as to have made a calculable political element, if he\nhad not been educated by having to manage his trade. A small mind\ntrained to useful occupation for the satisfying of private need becomes\na representative of genuine class-needs. Spike objected to certain items\nof legislation because they hampered his own trade, but his neighbours'\ntrade was hampered by the same causes; and though he would have been\nsimply selfish in a question of light or water between himself and a\nfellow-townsman, his need for a change in legislation, being shared by\nall his neighbours in trade, ceased to be simply selfish, and raised him\nto a sense of common injury and common benefit. True, if the law could\nhave been changed for the benefit of his particular business, leaving\nthe cotton trade in general in a sorry condition while he prospered,\nSpike might not have thought that result intolerably unjust; but the\nnature of things did not allow of such a result being contemplated as\npossible; it allowed of an enlarged market for Spike only through the\nenlargement of his neighbours' market, and the Possible is always the\nultimate master of our efforts and desires. Spike was obliged to\ncontemplate a general benefit, and thus became public-spirited in spite\nof himself. Or rather, the nature of things transmuted his active egoism\ninto a demand for a public benefit. Certainly if Spike had been born a\nmarquis he could not have had the same chance of being useful as a\npolitical element. But he might have had the same appearance, have been\nequally null in conversation, sceptical as to the reality of pleasure,\nand destitute of historical knowledge; perhaps even dimly disliking\nJesuitism as a quality in Catholic minds, or regarding Bacon as the\ninventor of physical science. The depths of middle-aged gentlemen's\nignorance will never be known, for want of public examinations in this\nbranch.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nTHE WATCH-DOG OF KNOWLEDGE\n\nMordax is an admirable man, ardent in intellectual work,\npublic-spirited, affectionate, and able to find the right words in\nconveying ingenious ideas or elevated feeling. Pity that to all these\ngraces he cannot add what would give them the utmost finish--the\noccasional admission that he has been in the wrong, the occasional frank\nwelcome of a new idea as something not before present to his mind! But\nno: Mordax's self-respect seems to be of that fiery quality which\ndemands that none but the monarchs of thought shall have an advantage\nover him, and in the presence of contradiction or the threat of having\nhis notions corrected, he becomes astonishingly unscrupulous and cruel\nfor so kindly and conscientious a man.\n\n\"You are fond of attributing those fine qualities to Mordax,\" said\nAcer, the other day, \"but I have not much belief in virtues that are\nalways requiring to be asserted in spite of appearances against them.\nTrue fairness and goodwill show themselves precisely where his are\nconspicuously absent. I mean, in recognising claims which the rest of\nthe world are not likely to stand up for. It does not need much love of\ntruth and justice in me to say that Aldebaran is a bright star, or Isaac\nNewton the greatest of discoverers; nor much kindliness in me to want my\nnotes to be heard above the rest in a chorus of hallelujahs to one\nalready crowned. It is my way to apply tests. Does the man who has the\near of the public use his advantage tenderly towards poor fellows who\nmay be hindered of their due if he treats their pretensions with scorn?\nThat is my test of his justice and benevolence.\"\n\nMy answer was, that his system of moral tests might be as delusive as\nwhat ignorant people take to be tests of intellect and learning. If the\nscholar or _savant_ cannot answer their haphazard questions on the\nshortest notice, their belief in his capacity is shaken. But the\nbetter-informed have given up the Johnsonian theory of mind as a pair of\nlegs able to walk east or west according to choice. Intellect is no\nlonger taken to be a ready-made dose of ability to attain eminence (or\nmediocrity) in all departments; it is even admitted that application in\none line of study or practice has often a laming effect in other\ndirections, and that an intellectual quality or special facility which\nis a furtherance in one medium of effort is a drag in another. We have\nconvinced ourselves by this time that a man may be a sage in celestial\nphysics and a poor creature in the purchase of seed-corn, or even in\ntheorising about the affections; that he may be a mere fumbler in\nphysiology and yet show a keen insight into human motives; that he may\nseem the \"poor Poll\" of the company in conversation and yet write with\nsome humorous vigour. It is not true that a man's intellectual power is\nlike the strength of a timber beam, to be measured by its weakest point.\n\nWhy should we any more apply that fallacious standard of what is called\nconsistency to a man's moral nature, and argue against the existence of\nfine impulses or habits of feeling in relation to his actions\ngenerally, because those better movements are absent in a class of cases\nwhich act peculiarly on an irritable form of his egoism? The mistake\nmight be corrected by our taking notice that the ungenerous words or\nacts which seem to us the most utterly incompatible with good\ndispositions in the offender, are those which offend ourselves. All\nother persons are able to draw a milder conclusion. Laniger, who has a\ntemper but no talent for repartee, having been run down in a fierce way\nby Mordax, is inwardly persuaded that the highly-lauded man is a wolf at\nheart: he is much tried by perceiving that his own friends seem to think\nno worse of the reckless assailant than they did before; and Corvus, who\nhas lately been flattered by some kindness from Mordax, is unmindful\nenough of Laniger's feeling to dwell on this instance of good-nature\nwith admiring gratitude. There is a fable that when the badger had been\nstung all over by bees, a bear consoled him by a rhapsodic account of\nhow he himself had just breakfasted on their honey. The badger replied,\npeevishly, \"The stings are in my flesh, and the sweetness is on your\nmuzzle.\" The bear, it is said, was surprised at the badger's want of\naltruism.\n\nBut this difference of sensibility between Laniger and his friends only\nmirrors in a faint way the difference between his own point of view and\nthat of the man who has injured him. If those neutral, perhaps even\naffectionate persons, form no lively conception of what Laniger suffers,\nhow should Mordax have any such sympathetic imagination to check him in\nwhat he persuades himself is a scourging administered by the qualified\nman to the unqualified? Depend upon it, his conscience, though active\nenough in some relations, has never given him a twinge because of his\npolemical rudeness and even brutality. He would go from the room where\nhe has been tiring himself through the watches of the night in lifting\nand turning a sick friend, and straightway write a reply or rejoinder in\nwhich he mercilessly pilloried a Laniger who had supposed that he could\ntell the world something else or more than had been sanctioned by the\neminent Mordax--and what was worse, had sometimes really done so. Does\nthis nullify the genuineness of motive which made him tender to his\nsuffering friend? Not at all. It only proves that his arrogant egoism,\nset on fire, sends up smoke and flame where just before there had been\nthe dews of fellowship and pity. He is angry and equips himself\naccordingly--with a penknife to give the offender a _comprachico_\ncountenance, a mirror to show him the effect, and a pair of nailed boots\nto give him his dismissal. All this to teach him who the Romans really\nwere, and to purge Inquiry of incompetent intrusion, so rendering an\nimportant service to mankind.\n\nWhen a man is in a rage and wants to hurt another in consequence, he can\nalways regard himself as the civil arm of a spiritual power, and all the\nmore easily because there is real need to assert the righteous efficacy\nof indignation. I for my part feel with the Lanigers, and should object\nall the more to their or my being lacerated and dressed with salt, if\nthe administrator of such torture alleged as a motive his care for Truth\nand posterity, and got himself pictured with a halo in consequence. In\ntransactions between fellow-men it is well to consider a little, in the\nfirst place, what is fair and kind towards the person immediately\nconcerned, before we spit and roast him on behalf of the next century\nbut one. Wide-reaching motives, blessed and glorious as they are, and of\nthe highest sacramental virtue, have their dangers, like all else that\ntouches the mixed life of the earth. They are archangels with awful brow\nand flaming sword, summoning and encouraging us to do the right and the\ndivinely heroic, and we feel a beneficent tremor in their presence; but\nto learn what it is they thus summon us to do, we have to consider the\nmortals we are elbowing, who are of our own stature and our own\nappetites. I cannot feel sure how my voting will affect the condition of\nCentral Asia in the coming ages, but I have good reason to believe that\nthe future populations there will be none the worse off because I\nabstain from conjectural vilification of my opponents during the present\nparliamentary session, and I am very sure that I shall be less injurious\nto my contemporaries. On the whole, and in the vast majority of\ninstances, the action by which we can do the best for future ages is of\nthe sort which has a certain beneficence and grace for contemporaries. A\nsour father may reform prisons, but considered in his sourness he does\nharm. The deed of Judas has been attributed to far-reaching views, and\nthe wish to hasten his Master's declaration of himself as the Messiah.\nPerhaps--I will not maintain the contrary--Judas represented his motive\nin this way, and felt justified in his traitorous kiss; but my belief\nthat he deserved, metaphorically speaking, to be where Dante saw him, at\nthe bottom of the Malebolge, would not be the less strong because he was\nnot convinced that his action was detestable. I refuse to accept a man\nwho has the stomach for such treachery, as a hero impatient for the\nredemption of mankind and for the beginning of a reign when the kisses\nshall be those of peace and righteousness.\n\nAll this is by the way, to show that my apology for Mordax was not\nfounded on his persuasion of superiority in his own motives, but on the\ncompatibility of unfair, equivocal, and even cruel actions with a nature\nwhich, apart from special temptations, is kindly and generous; and also\nto enforce the need of checks from a fellow-feeling with those whom our\nacts immediately (not distantly) concern. Will any one be so hardy as to\nmaintain that an otherwise worthy man cannot be vain and arrogant? I\nthink most of us have some interest in arguing the contrary. And it is\nof the nature of vanity and arrogance, if unchecked, to become cruel and\nself-justifying. There are fierce beasts within: chain them, chain them,\nand let them learn to cower before the creature with wider reason. This\nis what one wishes for Mordax--that his heart and brain should restrain\nthe outleap of roar and talons.\n\nAs to his unwillingness to admit that an idea which he has not\ndiscovered is novel to him, one is surprised that quick intellect and\nshrewd observation do not early gather reasons for being ashamed of a\nmental trick which makes one among the comic parts of that various actor\nConceited Ignorance.\n\nI have a sort of valet and factotum, an excellent, respectable servant,\nwhose spelling is so unvitiated by non-phonetic superfluities that he\nwrites _night_ as _nit_. One day, looking over his accounts, I said to\nhim jocosely, \"You are in the latest fashion with your spelling, Pummel:\nmost people spell \"night\" with a _gh_ between the _i_ and the _t_, but\nthe greatest scholars now spell it as you do.\" \"So I suppose, sir,\"\nsays Pummel; \"I've see it with a _gh_, but I've noways give into that\nmyself.\" You would never catch Pummel in an interjection of surprise. I\nhave sometimes laid traps for his astonishment, but he has escaped them\nall, either by a respectful neutrality, as of one who would not appear\nto notice that his master had been taking too much wine, or else by that\nstrong persuasion of his all-knowingness which makes it simply\nimpossible for him to feel himself newly informed. If I tell him that\nthe world is spinning round and along like a top, and that he is\nspinning with it, he says, \"Yes, I've heard a deal of that in my time,\nsir,\" and lifts the horizontal lines of his brow a little higher,\nbalancing his head from side to side as if it were too painfully full.\nWhether I tell him that they cook puppies in China, that there are ducks\nwith fur coats in Australia, or that in some parts of the world it is\nthe pink of politeness to put your tongue out on introduction to a\nrespectable stranger, Pummel replies, \"So I suppose, sir,\" with an air\nof resignation to hearing my poor version of well-known things, such as\nelders use in listening to lively boys lately presented with an\nanecdote book. His utmost concession is, that what you state is what he\nwould have supplied if you had given him _carte blanche_ instead of your\nneedless instruction, and in this sense his favourite answer is, \"I\nshould say.\"\n\n\"Pummel,\" I observed, a little irritated at not getting my coffee, \"if\nyou were to carry your kettle and spirits of wine up a mountain of a\nmorning, your water would boil there sooner.\" \"I should say, sir.\" \"Or,\nthere are boiling springs in Iceland. Better go to Iceland.\" \"That's\nwhat I've been thinking, sir.\"\n\nI have taken to asking him hard questions, and as I expected, he never\nadmits his own inability to answer them without representing it as\ncommon to the human race. \"What is the cause of the tides, Pummel?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, nobody rightly knows. Many gives their opinion, but if I\nwas to give mine, it 'ud be different.\"\n\nBut while he is never surprised himself, he is constantly imagining\nsituations of surprise for others. His own consciousness is that of one\nso thoroughly soaked in knowledge that further absorption is\nimpossible, but his neighbours appear to him to be in the state of\nthirsty sponges which it is a charity to besprinkle. His great\ninterest in thinking of foreigners is that they must be surprised at\nwhat they see in England, and especially at the beef. He is often\noccupied with the surprise Adam must have felt at the sight of the\nassembled animals--\"for he was not like us, sir, used from a b'y to\nWombwell's shows.\" He is fond of discoursing to the lad who acts as\nshoe-black and general subaltern, and I have overheard him saying to\nthat small upstart, with some severity, \"Now don't you pretend to know,\nbecause the more you pretend the more I see your ignirance\"--a lucidity\non his part which has confirmed my impression that the thoroughly\nself-satisfied person is the only one fully to appreciate the charm of\nhumility in others.\n\nYour diffident self-suspecting mortal is not very angry that others\nshould feel more comfortable about themselves, provided they are not\notherwise offensive: he is rather like the chilly person, glad to sit\nnext a warmer neighbour; or the timid, glad to have a courageous\nfellow-traveller. It cheers him to observe the store of small comforts\nthat his fellow-creatures may find in their self-complacency, just as\none is pleased to see poor old souls soothed by the tobacco and snuff\nfor which one has neither nose nor stomach oneself.\n\nBut your arrogant man will not tolerate a presumption which he sees to\nbe ill-founded. The service he regards society as most in need of is to\nput down the conceit which is so particularly rife around him that he is\ninclined to believe it the growing characteristic of the present age. In\nthe schools of Magna Graecia, or in the sixth century of our era, or\neven under Kublai Khan, he finds a comparative freedom from that\npresumption by which his contemporaries are stirring his able gall. The\nway people will now flaunt notions which are not his without appearing\nto mind that they are not his, strikes him as especially disgusting. It\nmight seem surprising to us that one strongly convinced of his own value\nshould prefer to exalt an age in which _he_ did not flourish, if it were\nnot for the reflection that the present age is the only one in which\nanybody has appeared to undervalue him.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nA HALF-BREED\n\nAn early deep-seated love to which we become faithless has its unfailing\nNemesis, if only in that division of soul which narrows all newer joys\nby the intrusion of regret and the established presentiment of change. I\nrefer not merely to the love of a person, but to the love of ideas,\npractical beliefs, and social habits. And faithlessness here means not a\ngradual conversion dependent on enlarged knowledge, but a yielding to\nseductive circumstance; not a conviction that the original choice was a\nmistake, but a subjection to incidents that flatter a growing desire. In\nthis sort of love it is the forsaker who has the melancholy lot; for an\nabandoned belief may be more effectively vengeful than Dido. The child\nof a wandering tribe caught young and trained to polite life, if he\nfeels an hereditary yearning can run away to the old wilds and get his\nnature into tune. But there is no such recovery possible to the man who\nremembers what he once believed without being convinced that he was in\nerror, who feels within him unsatisfied stirrings towards old beloved\nhabits and intimacies from which he has far receded without conscious\njustification or unwavering sense of superior attractiveness in the new.\nThis involuntary renegade has his character hopelessly jangled and out\nof tune. He is like an organ with its stops in the lawless condition of\nobtruding themselves without method, so that hearers are amazed by the\nmost unexpected transitions--the trumpet breaking in on the flute, and\nthe oboee confounding both.\n\nHence the lot of Mixtus affects me pathetically, notwithstanding that he\nspends his growing wealth with liberality and manifest enjoyment. To\nmost observers he appears to be simply one of the fortunate and also\nsharp commercial men who began with meaning to be rich and have become\nwhat they meant to be: a man never taken to be well-born, but\nsurprisingly better informed than the well-born usually are, and\ndistinguished among ordinary commercial magnates by a personal kindness\nwhich prompts him not only to help the suffering in a material way\nthrough his wealth, but also by direct ministration of his own; yet with\nall this, diffusing, as it were, the odour of a man delightedly\nconscious of his wealth as an equivalent for the other social\ndistinctions of rank and intellect which he can thus admire without\nenvying. Hardly one among those superficial observers can suspect that\nhe aims or has ever aimed at being a writer; still less can they imagine\nthat his mind is often moved by strong currents of regret and of the\nmost unworldly sympathies from the memories of a youthful time when his\nchosen associates were men and women whose only distinction was a\nreligious, a philanthropic, or an intellectual enthusiasm, when the lady\non whose words his attention most hung was a writer of minor religious\nliterature, when he was a visitor and exhorter of the poor in the alleys\nof a great provincial town, and when he attended the lectures given\nspecially to young men by Mr Apollos, the eloquent congregational\npreacher, who had studied in Germany and had liberal advanced views then\nfar beyond the ordinary teaching of his sect. At that time Mixtus\nthought himself a young man of socially reforming ideas, of religious\nprinciples and religious yearnings. It was within his prospects also to\nbe rich, but he looked forward to a use of his riches chiefly for\nreforming and religious purposes. His opinions were of a strongly\ndemocratic stamp, except that even then, belonging to the class of\nemployers, he was opposed to all demands in the employed that would\nrestrict the expansiveness of trade. He was the most democratic in\nrelation to the unreasonable privileges of the aristocracy and landed\ninterest; and he had also a religious sense of brotherhood with the\npoor. Altogether, he was a sincerely benevolent young man, interested in\nideas, and renouncing personal ease for the sake of study, religious\ncommunion, and good works. If you had known him then you would have\nexpected him to marry a highly serious and perhaps literary woman,\nsharing his benevolent and religious habits, and likely to encourage\nhis studies--a woman who along with himself would play a distinguished\npart in one of the most enlightened religious circles of a great\nprovincial capital.\n\nHow is it that Mixtus finds himself in a London mansion, and in society\ntotally unlike that which made the ideal of his younger years? And whom\n_did_ he marry?\n\nWhy, he married Scintilla, who fascinated him as she had fascinated\nothers, by her prettiness, her liveliness, and her music. It is a common\nenough case, that of a man being suddenly captivated by a woman nearly\nthe opposite of his ideal; or if not wholly captivated, at least\neffectively captured by a combination of circumstances along with an\nunwarily manifested inclination which might otherwise have been\ntransient. Mixtus was captivated and then captured on the worldly side\nof his disposition, which had been always growing and flourishing side\nby side with his philanthropic and religious tastes. He had ability in\nbusiness, and he had early meant to be rich; also, he was getting rich,\nand the taste for such success was naturally growing with the pleasure\nof rewarded exertion. It was during a business sojourn in London that he\nmet Scintilla, who, though without fortune, associated with families of\nGreek merchants living in a style of splendour, and with artists\npatronised by such wealthy entertainers. Mixtus on this occasion became\nfamiliar with a world in which wealth seemed the key to a more brilliant\nsort of dominance than that of a religious patron in the provincial\ncircles of X. Would it not be possible to unite the two kinds of sway? A\nman bent on the most useful ends might, _with a fortune large enough_,\nmake morality magnificent, and recommend religious principle by showing\nit in combination with the best kind of house and the most liberal of\ntables; also with a wife whose graces, wit, and accomplishments gave a\nfinish sometimes lacking even to establishments got up with that\nunhesitating worldliness to which high cost is a sufficient reason.\nEnough.\n\nMixtus married Scintilla. Now this lively lady knew nothing of\nNonconformists, except that they were unfashionable: she did not\ndistinguish one conventicle from another, and Mr Apollos with his\nenlightened interpretations seemed to her as heavy a bore, if not quite\nso ridiculous, as Mr Johns could have been with his solemn twang at the\nBaptist chapel in the lowest suburbs, or as a local preacher among the\nMethodists. In general, people who appeared seriously to believe in any\nsort of doctrine, whether religious, social, or philosophical, seemed\nrather absurd to Scintilla. Ten to one these theoretic people pronounced\noddly, had some reason or other for saying that the most agreeable\nthings were wrong, wore objectionable clothes, and wanted you to\nsubscribe to something. They were probably ignorant of art and music,\ndid not understand _badinage_, and, in fact, could talk of nothing\namusing. In Scintilla's eyes the majority of persons were ridiculous and\ndeplorably wanting in that keen perception of what was good taste, with\nwhich she herself was blest by nature and education; but the people\nunderstood to be religious or otherwise theoretic, were the most\nridiculous of all, without being proportionately amusing and invitable.\n\nDid Mixtus not discover this view of Scintilla's before their marriage?\nOr did he allow her to remain in ignorance of habits and opinions which\nhad made half the occupation of his youth?\n\nWhen a man is inclined to marry a particular woman, and has made any\ncommittal of himself, this woman's opinions, however different from his\nown, are readily regarded as part of her pretty ways, especially if they\nare merely negative; as, for example, that she does not insist on the\nTrinity or on the rightfulness or expediency of church rates, but simply\nregards her lover's troubling himself in disputation on these heads as\nstuff and nonsense. The man feels his own superior strength, and is sure\nthat marriage will make no difference to him on the subjects about which\nhe is in earnest. And to laugh at men's affairs is a woman's privilege,\ntending to enliven the domestic hearth. If Scintilla had no liking for\nthe best sort of nonconformity, she was without any troublesome bias\ntowards Episcopacy, Anglicanism, and early sacraments, and was quite\ncontented not to go to church.\n\nAs to Scintilla's acquaintance with her lover's tastes on these\nsubjects, she was equally convinced on her side that a husband's queer\nways while he was a bachelor would be easily laughed out of him when he\nhad married an adroit woman. Mixtus, she felt, was an excellent\ncreature, quite likable, who was getting rich; and Scintilla meant to\nhave all the advantages of a rich man's wife. She was not in the least a\nwicked woman; she was simply a pretty animal of the ape kind, with an\naptitude for certain accomplishments which education had made the most\nof.\n\nBut we have seen what has been the result to poor Mixtus. He has become\nricher even than he dreamed of being, has a little palace in London, and\nentertains with splendour the half-aristocratic, professional, and\nartistic society which he is proud to think select. This society regards\nhim as a clever fellow in his particular branch, seeing that he has\nbecome a considerable capitalist, and as a man desirable to have on the\nlist of one's acquaintance. But from every other point of view Mixtus\nfinds himself personally submerged: what he happens to think is not felt\nby his esteemed guests to be of any consequence, and what he used to\nthink with the ardour of conviction he now hardly ever expresses. He is\ntransplanted, and the sap within him has long been diverted into other\nthan the old lines of vigorous growth. How could he speak to the artist\nCrespi or to Sir Hong Kong Bantam about the enlarged doctrine of Mr\nApollos? How could he mention to them his former efforts towards\nevangelising the inhabitants of the X. alleys? And his references to his\nhistorical and geographical studies towards a survey of possible markets\nfor English products are received with an air of ironical suspicion by\nmany of his political friends, who take his pretension to give advice\nconcerning the Amazon, the Euphrates, and the Niger as equivalent to the\ncurrier's wide views on the applicability of leather. He can only make a\nfigure through his genial hospitality. It is in vain that he buys the\nbest pictures and statues of the best artists. Nobody will call him a\njudge in art. If his pictures and statues are well chosen it is\ngenerally thought that Scintilla told him what to buy; and yet Scintilla\nin other connections is spoken of as having only a superficial and\noften questionable taste. Mixtus, it is decided, is a good fellow, not\nignorant--no, really having a good deal of knowledge as well as sense,\nbut not easy to classify otherwise than as a rich man. He has\nconsequently become a little uncertain as to his own point of view, and\nin his most unreserved moments of friendly intercourse, even when\nspeaking to listeners whom he thinks likely to sympathise with the\nearlier part of his career, he presents himself in all his various\naspects and feels himself in turn what he has been, what he is, and what\nothers take him to be (for this last status is what we must all more or\nless accept). He will recover with some glow of enthusiasm the vision of\nhis old associates, the particular limit he was once accustomed to trace\nof freedom in religious speculation, and his old ideal of a worthy life;\nbut he will presently pass to the argument that money is the only means\nby which you can get what is best worth having in the world, and will\narrive at the exclamation \"Give me money!\" with the tone and gesture of\na man who both feels and knows. Then if one of his audience, not having\nmoney, remarks that a man may have made up his mind to do without money\nbecause he prefers something else, Mixtus is with him immediately,\ncordially concurring in the supreme value of mind and genius, which\nindeed make his own chief delight, in that he is able to entertain the\nadmirable possessors of these attributes at his own table, though not\nhimself reckoned among them. Yet, he will proceed to observe, there was\na time when he sacrificed his sleep to study, and even now amid the\npress of business he from time to time thinks of taking up the\nmanuscripts which he hopes some day to complete, and is always\nincreasing his collection of valuable works bearing on his favourite\ntopics. And it is true that he has read much in certain directions, and\ncan remember what he has read; he knows the history and theories of\ncolonisation and the social condition of countries that do not at\npresent consume a sufficiently large share of our products and\nmanufactures. He continues his early habit of regarding the spread of\nChristianity as a great result of our commercial intercourse with black,\nbrown, and yellow populations; but this is an idea not spoken of in the\nsort of fashionable society that Scintilla collects round her husband's\ntable, and Mixtus now philosophically reflects that the cause must come\nbefore the effect, and that the thing to be directly striven for is the\ncommercial intercourse, not excluding a little war if that also should\nprove needful as a pioneer of Christianity. He has long been wont to\nfeel bashful about his former religion; as if it were an old attachment\nhaving consequences which he did not abandon but kept in decent privacy,\nhis avowed objects and actual position being incompatible with their\npublic acknowledgment.\n\nThere is the same kind of fluctuation in his aspect towards social\nquestions and duties. He has not lost the kindness that used to make him\na benefactor and succourer of the needy, and he is still liberal in\nhelping forward the clever and industrious; but in his active\nsuperintendence of commercial undertakings he has contracted more and\nmore of the bitterness which capitalists and employers often feel to be\na reasonable mood towards obstructive proletaries. Hence many who this\nis an idea not spoken of in the sort of fashionable society that\nScintilla collects round her husband's table, and Mixtus now\nphilosophically reflects that the cause must come before the effect, and\nthat the thing to be directly striven for is the commercial intercourse,\nnot excluding a little war if that also should prove needful as a\npioneer of Christianity. He has long been wont to feel bashful about his\nformer religion; as if it were an old attachment having consequences\nwhich he did not abandon but kept in decent privacy, his avowed objects\nand actual position being incompatible with their public acknowledgment.\n\nThere is the same kind of fluctuation in his aspect towards social\nquestions and duties. He has not lost the kindness that used to make him\na benefactor and succourer of the needy, and he is still liberal in\nhelping forward the clever and industrious; but in his active\nsuperintendence of commercial undertakings he has contracted more and\nmore of the bitterness which capitalists and employers often feel to be\na reasonable mood towards obstructive proletaries. Hence many who have\noccasionally met him when trade questions were being discussed, conclude\nhim to be indistinguishable from the ordinary run of moneyed and\nmoney-getting men. Indeed, hardly any of his acquaintances know what\nMixtus really is, considered as a whole--nor does Mixtus himself know\nit.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nDEBASING THE MORAL CURRENCY.\n\n\"Il ne faut pas mettre un ridicule ou il n'y en a point: c'est se gater\nle gout, c'est corrompre son jugement et celui des autres. Mais le\nridicule qui est quelque part, il faut l'y voir, l'en tirer avec grace\net d'une maniere qui plaise et qui instruise.\"\n\nI am fond of quoting this passage from La Bruyere, because the subject\nis one where I like to show a Frenchman on my side, to save my\nsentiments from being set down to my peculiar dulness and deficient\nsense of the ludicrous, and also that they may profit by that\nenhancement of ideas when presented in a foreign tongue, that glamour of\nunfamiliarity conferring a dignity on the foreign names of very common\nthings, of which even a philosopher like Dugald Stewart confesses the\ninfluence. I remember hearing a fervid woman attempt to recite in\nEnglish the narrative of a begging Frenchman who described the violent\ndeath of his father in the July days. The narrative had impressed her,\nthrough the mists of her flushed anxiety to understand it, as something\nquite grandly pathetic; but finding the facts turn out meagre, and her\naudience cold, she broke off, saying, \"It sounded so much finer in\nFrench--_j'ai vu le sang de mon pere_, and so on--I wish I could repeat\nit in French.\" This was a pardonable illusion in an old-fashioned lady\nwho had not received the polyglot education of the present day; but I\nobserve that even now much nonsense and bad taste win admiring\nacceptance solely by virtue of the French language, and one may fairly\ndesire that what seems a just discrimination should profit by the\nfashionable prejudice in favour of La Bruyere's idiom. But I wish he had\nadded that the habit of dragging the ludicrous into topics where the\nchief interest is of a different or even opposite kind is a sign not of\nendowment, but of deficiency. The art of spoiling is within reach of the\ndullest faculty: the coarsest clown with a hammer in his hand might\nchip the nose off every statue and bust in the Vatican, and stand\ngrinning at the effect of his work. Because wit is an exquisite product\nof high powers, we are not therefore forced to admit the sadly confused\ninference of the monotonous jester that he is establishing his\nsuperiority over every less facetious person, and over every topic on\nwhich he is ignorant or insensible, by being uneasy until he has\ndistorted it in the small cracked mirror which he carries about with him\nas a joking apparatus. Some high authority is needed to give many worthy\nand timid persons the freedom of muscular repose under the growing\ndemand on them to laugh when they have no other reason than the peril of\nbeing taken for dullards; still more to inspire them with the courage to\nsay that they object to the theatrical spoiling for themselves and their\nchildren of all affecting themes, all the grander deeds and aims of men,\nby burlesque associations adapted to the taste of rich fishmongers in\nthe stalls and their assistants in the gallery. The English people in\nthe present generation are falsely reputed to know Shakspere (as, by\nsome innocent persons, the Florentine mule-drivers are believed to have\nknown the _Divina Commedia_, not, perhaps, excluding all the subtle\ndiscourses in the _Purgatorio_ and _Paradiso_); but there seems a clear\nprospect that in the coming generation he will be known to them through\nburlesques, and that his plays will find a new life as pantomimes. A\nbottle-nosed Lear will come on with a monstrous corpulence from which he\nwill frantically dance himself free during the midnight storm; Rosalind\nand Celia will join in a grotesque ballet with shepherds and\nshepherdesses; Ophelia in fleshings and a voluminous brevity of\ngrenadine will dance through the mad scene, finishing with the famous\n\"attitude of the scissors\" in the arms of Laertes; and all the speeches\nin \"Hamlet\" will be so ingeniously parodied that the originals will be\nreduced to a mere _memoria technica_ of the improver's puns--premonitory\nsigns of a hideous millennium, in which the lion will have to lie down\nwith the lascivious monkeys whom (if we may trust Pliny) his soul\nnaturally abhors.\n\nI have been amazed to find that some artists whose own works have the\nideal stamp, are quite insensible to the damaging tendency of the\nburlesquing spirit which ranges to and fro and up and down on the earth,\nseeing no reason (except a precarious censorship) why it should not\nappropriate every sacred, heroic, and pathetic theme which serves to\nmake up the treasure of human admiration, hope, and love. One would have\nthought that their own half-despairing efforts to invest in worthy\noutward shape the vague inward impressions of sublimity, and the\nconsciousness of an implicit ideal in the commonest scenes, might have\nmade them susceptible of some disgust or alarm at a species of burlesque\nwhich is likely to render their compositions no better than a dissolving\nview, where every noble form is seen melting into its preposterous\ncaricature. It used to be imagined of the unhappy medieval Jews that\nthey parodied Calvary by crucifying dogs; if they had been guilty they\nwould at least have had the excuse of the hatred and rage begotten by\npersecution. Are we on the way to a parody which shall have no other\nexcuse than the reckless search after fodder for degraded\nappetites--after the pay to be earned by pasturing Circe's herd where\nthey may defile every monument of that growing life which should have\nkept them human?\n\nThe world seems to me well supplied with what is genuinely ridiculous:\nwit and humour may play as harmlessly or beneficently round the changing\nfacets of egoism, absurdity, and vice, as the sunshine over the rippling\nsea or the dewy meadows. Why should we make our delicious sense of the\nludicrous, with its invigorating shocks of laughter and its\nirrepressible smiles which are the outglow of an inward radiation as\ngentle and cheering as the warmth of morning, flourish like a brigand on\nthe robbery of our mental wealth?--or let it take its exercise as a\nmadman might, if allowed a free nightly promenade, by drawing the\npopulace with bonfires which leave some venerable structure a blackened\nruin or send a scorching smoke across the portraits of the past, at\nwhich we once looked with a loving recognition of fellowship, and\ndisfigure them into butts of mockery?--nay, worse--use it to degrade the\nhealthy appetites and affections of our nature as they are seen to be\ndegraded in insane patients whose system, all out of joint, finds\nmatter for screaming laughter in mere topsy-turvy, makes every passion\npreposterous or obscene, and turns the hard-won order of life into a\nsecond chaos hideous enough to make one wail that the first was ever\nthrilled with light?\n\nThis is what I call debasing the moral currency: lowering the value of\nevery inspiring fact and tradition so that it will command less and less\nof the spiritual products, the generous motives which sustain the charm\nand elevation of our social existence--the something besides bread by\nwhich man saves his soul alive. The bread-winner of the family may\ndemand more and more coppery shillings, or assignats, or greenbacks for\nhis day's work, and so get the needful quantum of food; but let that\nmoral currency be emptied of its value--let a greedy buffoonery debase\nall historic beauty, majesty, and pathos, and the more you heap up the\ndesecrated symbols the greater will be the lack of the ennobling\nemotions which subdue the tyranny of suffering, and make ambition one\nwith social virtue.\n\nAnd yet, it seems, parents will put into the hands of their children\nridiculous parodies (perhaps with more ridiculous \"illustrations\") of\nthe poems which stirred their own tenderness or filial piety, and carry\nthem to make their first acquaintance with great men, great works, or\nsolemn crises through the medium of some miscellaneous burlesque which,\nwith its idiotic puns and farcical attitudes, will remain among their\nprimary associations, and reduce them throughout their time of studious\npreparation for life to the moral imbecility of an inward giggle at what\nmight have stimulated their high emulation or fed the fountains of\ncompassion, trust, and constancy. One wonders where these parents have\ndeposited that stock of morally educating stimuli which is to be\nindependent of poetic tradition, and to subsist in spite of the finest\nimages being degraded and the finest words of genius being poisoned as\nwith some befooling drug.\n\nWill fine wit, will exquisite humour prosper the more through this\nturning of all things indiscriminately into food for a gluttonous\nlaughter, an idle craving without sense of flavours? On the contrary.\nThat delightful power which La Bruyere points to--\"le ridicule qui est\nquelque part, il faut l'y voir, l'en tirer avec grace et d'une maniere\nqui plaise et qui instruise\"--depends on a discrimination only\ncompatible with the varied sensibilities which give sympathetic insight,\nand with the justice of perception which is another name for grave\nknowledge. Such a result is no more to be expected from faculties on the\nstrain to find some small hook by which they may attach the lowest\nincongruity to the most momentous subject, than it is to be expected of\na sharper, watching for gulls in a great political assemblage, that he\nwill notice the blundering logic of partisan speakers, or season his\nobservation with the salt of historical parallels. But after all our\npsychological teaching, and in the midst of our zeal for education, we\nare still, most of us, at the stage of believing that mental powers and\nhabits have somehow, not perhaps in the general statement, but in any\nparticular case, a kind of spiritual glaze against conditions which we\nare continually applying to them. We soak our children in habits of\ncontempt and exultant gibing, and yet are confident that--as Clarissa\none day said to me--\"We can always teach them to be reverent in the\nright place, you know.\" And doubtless if she were to take her boys to\nsee a burlesque Socrates, with swollen legs, dying in the utterance of\ncockney puns, and were to hang up a sketch of this comic scene among\ntheir bedroom prints, she would think this preparation not at all to the\nprejudice of their emotions on hearing their tutor read that narrative\nof the _Apology_ which has been consecrated by the reverent gratitude of\nages. This is the impoverishment that threatens our posterity:--a new\nFamine, a meagre fiend with lewd grin and clumsy hoof, is breathing a\nmoral mildew over the harvest of our human sentiments. These are the\nmost delicate elements of our too easily perishable civilisation. And\nhere again I like to quote a French testimony. Sainte Beuve, referring\nto a time of insurrectionary disturbance, says: \"Rien de plus prompt a\nbaisser que la civilisation dans des crises comme celle-ci; on perd en\ntrois semaines le resultat de plusieurs siecles. La civilisation, la\n_vie_ est une chose apprise et inventee, qu'on le sache bien: '_Inventas\naut qui vitam excoluere per artes_.' Les hommes apres quelques annees de\npaix oublient trop cette verite: ils arrivent a croire que la _culture_\nest chose innee, qu'elle est la meme chose que la _nature_. La\nsauvagerie est toujours la a deux pas, et, des qu'on lache pied, elle\nrecommence.\" We have been severely enough taught (if we were willing to\nlearn) that our civilisation, considered as a splendid material fabric,\nis helplessly in peril without the spiritual police of sentiments or\nideal feelings. And it is this invisible police which we had need, as a\ncommunity, strive to maintain in efficient force. How if a dangerous\n\"Swing\" were sometimes disguised in a versatile entertainer devoted to\nthe amusement of mixed audiences? And I confess that sometimes when I\nsee a certain style of young lady, who checks our tender admiration with\nrouge and henna and all the blazonry of an extravagant expenditure, with\nslang and bold _brusquerie_ intended to signify her emancipated view of\nthings, and with cynical mockery which she mistakes for penetration, I\nam sorely tempted to hiss out \"_Petroleuse!_\" It is a small matter to\nhave our palaces set aflame compared with the misery of having our sense\nof a noble womanhood, which is the inspiration of a purifying shame, the\npromise of life--penetrating affection, stained and blotted out by\nimages of repulsiveness. These things come--not of higher education,\nbut--of dull ignorance fostered into pertness by the greedy vulgarity\nwhich reverses Peter's visionary lesson and learns to call all things\ncommon and unclean. It comes of debasing the moral currency.\n\nThe Tirynthians, according to an ancient story reported by Athenaeus,\nbecoming conscious that their trick of laughter at everything and\nnothing was making them unfit for the conduct of serious affairs,\nappealed to the Delphic oracle for some means of cure. The god\nprescribed a peculiar form of sacrifice, which would be effective if\nthey could carry it through without laughing. They did their best; but\nthe flimsy joke of a boy upset their unaccustomed gravity, and in this\nway the oracle taught them that even the gods could not prescribe a\nquick cure for a long vitiation, or give power and dignity to a people\nwho in a crisis of the public wellbeing were at the mercy of a poor\njest.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nTHE WASP CREDITED WITH THE HONEYCOMB\n\nNo man, I imagine, would object more strongly than Euphorion to\ncommunistic principles in relation to material property, but with regard\nto property in ideas he entertains such principles willingly, and is\ndisposed to treat the distinction between Mine and Thine in original\nauthorship as egoistic, narrowing, and low. I have known him, indeed,\ninsist at some expense of erudition on the prior right of an ancient, a\nmedieval, or an eighteenth century writer to be credited with a view or\nstatement lately advanced with some show of originality; and this\nchampionship seems to imply a nicety of conscience towards the dead. He\nis evidently unwilling that his neighbours should get more credit than\nis due to them, and in this way he appears to recognise a certain\nproprietorship even in spiritual production. But perhaps it is no real\ninconsistency that, with regard to many instances of modern origination,\nit is his habit to talk with a Gallic largeness and refer to the\nuniverse: he expatiates on the diffusive nature of intellectual\nproducts, free and all-embracing as the liberal air; on the\ninfinitesimal smallness of individual origination compared with the\nmassive inheritance of thought on which every new generation enters; on\nthat growing preparation for every epoch through which certain ideas or\nmodes of view are said to be in the air, and, still more metaphorically\nspeaking, to be inevitably absorbed, so that every one may be excused\nfor not knowing how he got them. Above all, he insists on the proper\nsubordination of the irritable self, the mere vehicle of an idea or\ncombination which, being produced by the sum total of the human race,\nmust belong to that multiple entity, from the accomplished lecturer or\npopulariser who transmits it, to the remotest generation of Fuegians or\nHottentots, however indifferent these may be to the superiority of their\nright above that of the eminently perishable dyspeptic author.\n\nOne may admit that such considerations carry a profound truth to be\neven religiously contemplated, and yet object all the more to the mode\nin which Euphorion seems to apply them. I protest against the use of\nthese majestic conceptions to do the dirty work of unscrupulosity and\njustify the non-payment of conscious debts which cannot be defined or\nenforced by the law. Especially since it is observable that the large\nviews as to intellectual property which can apparently reconcile an\nable person to the use of lately borrowed ideas as if they were his\nown, when this spoliation is favoured by the public darkness, never\nhinder him from joining in the zealous tribute of recognition and\napplause to those warriors of Truth whose triumphal arches are seen in\nthe public ways, those conquerors whose battles and \"annexations\" even\nthe carpenters and bricklayers know by name. Surely the acknowledgment\nof a mental debt which will not be immediately detected, and may never\nbe asserted, is a case to which the traditional susceptibility to\n\"debts of honour\" would be suitably transferred. There is no massive\npublic opinion that can be expected to tell on these relations of\nthinkers and investigators&mdash;relations to be thoroughly understood\nand felt only by those who are interested in the life of ideas and\nacquainted with their history. To lay false claim to an invention or\ndiscovery which has an immediate market value; to vamp up a\nprofessedly new book of reference by stealing from the pages of one\nalready produced at the cost of much labour and material; to copy\nsomebody else's poem and send the manuscript to a magazine, or hand it\nabout among; friends as an original \"effusion;\" to deliver an elegant\nextract from a known writer as a piece of improvised\neloquence:&mdash;these are the limits within which the dishonest\npretence of originality is likely to get hissed or hooted and bring\nmore or less shame on the culprit. It is not necessary to understand\nthe merit of a performance, or even to spell with any comfortable\nconfidence, in order to perceive at once that such pretences are not\nrespectable. But the difference between these vulgar frauds, these\ndevices of ridiculous jays whose ill-secured plumes are seen falling\noff them as they run, and the quiet appropriation of other people's\nphilosophic or scientific ideas, can hardly be held to lie in their\nmoral quality unless we take impunity as our criterion. The pitiable\njays had no presumption in their favour and foolishly fronted an alert\nincredulity; but Euphorion, the accomplished theorist, has an audience\nwho expect much of him, and take it as the most natural thing in the\nworld that every unusual view which he presents anonymously should be\ndue solely to his ingenuity. His borrowings are no incongruous\nfeathers awkwardly stuck on; they have an appropriateness which makes\nthem seem an answer to anticipation, like the return phrases of a\nmelody. Certainly one cannot help the ignorant conclusions of polite\nsociety, and there are perhaps fashionable persons who, if a speaker\nhas occasion to explain what the occipat is, will consider that he has\nlately discovered that curiously named portion of the animal frame:\none cannot give a genealogical introduction to every long-stored item\nof fact or conjecture that may happen to be a revelation for the large\nclass of persons who are understood to judge soundly on a small basis\nof knowledge. But Euphorion would be very sorry to have it supposed\nthat he is unacquainted with the history of ideas, and sometimes\ncarries even into minutiae the evidence of his exact registration of\nnames in connection with quotable phrases or suggestions: I can\ntherefore only explain the apparent infirmity of his memory in cases\nof larger \"conveyance\" by supposing that he is accustomed by the very\nassociation of largeness to range them at once under those grand laws\nof the universe in the light of which Mine and Thine disappear and are\nresolved into Everybody's or Nobody's, and one man's particular\nobligations to another melt untraceably into the obligations of the\nearth to the solar system in general.\n\nEuphorion himself, if a particular omission of acknowledgment were\nbrought home to him, would probably take a narrower ground of\nexplanation. It was a lapse of memory; or it did not occur to him as\nnecessary in this case to mention a name, the source being well\nknown--or (since this seems usually to act as a strong reason for\nmention) he rather abstained from adducing the name because it might\ninjure the excellent matter advanced, just as an obscure trade-mark\ncasts discredit on a good commodity, and even on the retailer who has\nfurnished himself from a quarter not likely to be esteemed first-rate.\nNo doubt this last is a genuine and frequent reason for the\nnon-acknowledgment of indebtedness to what one may call impersonal as\nwell as personal sources: even an American editor of school classics\nwhose own English could not pass for more than a syntactical shoddy of\nthe cheapest sort, felt it unfavourable to his reputation for sound\nlearning that he should be obliged to the Penny Cyclopaedia, and\ndisguised his references to it under contractions in which _Us. Knowl._.\ntook the place of the low word _Penny_. Works of this convenient stamp,\neasily obtained and well nourished with matter, are felt to be like rich\nbut unfashionable relations who are visited and received in privacy, and\nwhose capital is used or inherited without any ostentatious insistance\non their names and places of abode. As to memory, it is known that this\nfrail faculty naturally lets drop the facts which are less flattering to\nour self-love--when it does not retain them carefully as subjects not to\nbe approached, marshy spots with a warning flag over them. But it is\nalways interesting to bring forward eminent names, such as Patricius or\nScaliger, Euler or Lagrange, Bopp or Humboldt. To know exactly what has\nbeen drawn from them is erudition and heightens our own influence, which\nseems advantageous to mankind; whereas to cite an author whose ideas may\npass as higher currency under our own signature can have no object\nexcept the contradictory one of throwing the illumination over his\nfigure when it is important to be seen oneself. All these reasons must\nweigh considerably with those speculative persons who have to ask\nthemselves whether or not Universal Utilitarianism requires that in the\nparticular instance before them they should injure a man who has been of\nservice to them, and rob a fellow-workman of the credit which is due to\nhim.\n\nAfter all, however, it must be admitted that hardly any accusation is\nmore difficult to prove, and more liable to be false, than that of a\nplagiarism which is the conscious theft of ideas and deliberate\nreproduction of them as original. The arguments on the side of acquittal\nare obvious and strong:--the inevitable coincidences of contemporary\nthinking; and our continual experience of finding notions turning up in\nour minds without any label on them to tell us whence they came; so that\nif we are in the habit of expecting much from our own capacity we accept\nthem at once as a new inspiration. Then, in relation to the elder\nauthors, there is the difficulty first of learning and then of\nremembering exactly what has been wrought into the backward tapestry of\nthe world's history, together with the fact that ideas acquired long ago\nreappear as the sequence of an awakened interest or a line of inquiry\nwhich is really new in us, whence it is conceivable that if we were\nancients some of us might be offering grateful hecatombs by mistake, and\nproving our honesty in a ruinously expensive manner. On the other hand,\nthe evidence on which plagiarism is concluded is often of a kind which,\nthough much trusted in questions of erudition and historical criticism,\nis apt to lead us injuriously astray in our daily judgments, especially\nof the resentful, condemnatory sort. How Pythagoras came by his ideas,\nwhether St Paul was acquainted with all the Greek poets, what Tacitus\nmust have known by hearsay and systematically ignored, are points on\nwhich a false persuasion of knowledge is less damaging to justice and\ncharity than an erroneous confidence, supported by reasoning\nfundamentally similar, of my neighbour's blameworthy behaviour in a case\nwhere I am personally concerned. No premisses require closer scrutiny\nthan those which lead to the constantly echoed conclusion, \"He must have\nknown,\" or \"He must have read.\" I marvel that this facility of belief on\nthe side of knowledge can subsist under the daily demonstration that the\neasiest of all things to the human mind is _not_ to know and _not_ to\nread. To praise, to blame, to shout, grin, or hiss, where others shout,\ngrin, or hiss--these are native tendencies; but to know and to read are\nartificial, hard accomplishments, concerning which the only safe\nsupposition is, that as little of them has been done as the case admits.\nAn author, keenly conscious of having written, can hardly help imagining\nhis condition of lively interest to be shared by others, just as we are\nall apt to suppose that the chill or heat we are conscious of must be\ngeneral, or even to think that our sons and daughters, our pet schemes,\nand our quarrelling correspondence, are themes to which intelligent\npersons will listen long without weariness. But if the ardent author\nhappen to be alive to practical teaching he will soon learn to divide\nthe larger part of the enlightened public into those who have not read\nhim and think it necessary to tell him so when they meet him in polite\nsociety, and those who have equally abstained from reading him, but wish\nto conceal this negation and speak of his \"incomparable works\" with that\ntrust in testimony which always has its cheering side.\n\nHence it is worse than foolish to entertain silent suspicions of\nplagiarism, still more to give them voice, when they are founded on a\nconstruction of probabilities which a little more attention to everyday\noccurrences as a guide in reasoning would show us to be really\nworthless, considered as proof. The length to which one man's memory can\ngo in letting drop associations that are vital to another can hardly\nfind a limit. It is not to be supposed that a person desirous to make an\nagreeable impression on you would deliberately choose to insist to you,\nwith some rhetorical sharpness, on an argument which you were the first\nto elaborate in public; yet any one who listens may overhear such\ninstances of obliviousness. You naturally remember your peculiar\nconnection with your acquaintance's judicious views; but why should\n_he_? Your fatherhood, which is an intense feeling to you, is only an\nadditional fact of meagre interest for him to remember; and a sense of\nobligation to the particular living fellow-struggler who has helped us\nin our thinking, is not yet a form of memory the want of which is felt\nto be disgraceful or derogatory, unless it is taken to be a want of\npolite instruction, or causes the missing of a cockade on a day of\ncelebration. In our suspicions of plagiarism we must recognise as the\nfirst weighty probability, that what we who feel injured remember best\nis precisely what is least likely to enter lastingly into the memory of\nour neighbours. But it is fair to maintain that the neighbour who\nborrows your property, loses it for a while, and when it turns up again\nforgets your connection with it and counts it his own, shows himself so\nmuch the feebler in grasp and rectitude of mind. Some absent persons\ncannot remember the state of wear in their own hats and umbrellas, and\nhave no mental check to tell them that they have carried home a\nfellow-visitor's more recent purchase: they may be excellent\nhouseholders, far removed from the suspicion of low devices, but one\nwishes them a more correct perception, and a more wary sense that a\nneighbours umbrella may be newer than their own.\n\nTrue, some persons are so constituted that the very excellence of an\nidea seems to them a convincing reason that it must be, if not solely,\nyet especially theirs. It fits in so beautifully with their general\nwisdom, it lies implicitly in so many of their manifested opinions, that\nif they have not yet expressed it (because of preoccupation) it is\nclearly a part of their indigenous produce, and is proved by their\nimmediate eloquent promulgation of it to belong more naturally and\nappropriately to them than to the person who seemed first to have\nalighted on it, and who sinks in their all-originating consciousness to\nthat low kind of entity, a second cause. This is not lunacy, nor\npretence, but a genuine state of mind very effective in practice, and\noften carrying the public with it, so that the poor Columbus is found to\nbe a very faulty adventurer, and the continent is named after Amerigo.\nLighter examples of this instinctive appropriation are constantly met\nwith among brilliant talkers. Aquila is too agreeable and amusing for\nany one who is not himself bent on display to be angry at his\nconversational rapine--his habit of darting down on every morsel of\nbooty that other birds may hold in their beaks, with an innocent air, as\nif it were all intended for his use, and honestly counted on by him as a\ntribute in kind. Hardly any man, I imagine, can have had less trouble in\ngathering a showy stock of information than Aquila. On close inquiry you\nwould probably find that he had not read one epoch-making book of modern\ntimes, for he has a career which obliges him to much correspondence and\nother official work, and he is too fond of being in company to spend his\nleisure moments in study; but to his quick eye, ear, and tongue, a few\npredatory excursions in conversation where there are instructed persons,\ngradually furnish surprisingly clever modes of statement and allusion on\nthe dominant topic. When he first adopts a subject he necessarily falls\ninto mistakes, and it is interesting to watch his gradual progress into\nfuller information and better nourished irony, without his ever needing\nto admit that he has made a blunder or to appear conscious of\ncorrection. Suppose, for example, he had incautiously founded some\ningenious remarks on a hasty reckoning that nine thirteens made a\nhundred and two, and the insignificant Bantam, hitherto silent, seemed\nto spoil the flow of ideas by stating that the product could not be\ntaken as less than a hundred and seventeen, Aquila would glide on in the\nmost graceful manner from a repetition of his previous remark to the\ncontinuation--\"All this is on the supposition that a hundred and two\nwere all that could be got out of nine thirteens; but as all the world\nknows that nine thirteens will yield,\" &c.--proceeding straightway into\na new train of ingenious consequences, and causing Bantam to be regarded\nby all present as one of those slow persons who take irony for\nignorance, and who would warn the weasel to keep awake. How should a\nsmall-eyed, feebly crowing mortal like him be quicker in arithmetic than\nthe keen-faced forcible Aquila, in whom universal knowledge is easily\ncredible? Looked into closely, the conclusion from a man's profile,\nvoice, and fluency to his certainty in multiplication beyond the\ntwelves, seems to show a confused notion of the way in which very common\nthings are connected; but it is on such false correlations that men\nfound half their inferences about each other, and high places of trust\nmay sometimes be held on no better foundation.\n\nIt is a commonplace that words, writings, measures, and performances in\ngeneral, have qualities assigned them not by a direct judgment on the\nperformances themselves, but by a presumption of what they are likely to\nbe, considering who is the performer. We all notice in our neighbours\nthis reference to names as guides in criticism, and all furnish\nillustrations of it in our own practice; for, check ourselves as we\nwill, the first impression from any sort of work must depend on a\nprevious attitude of mind, and this will constantly be determined by the\ninfluences of a name. But that our prior confidence or want of\nconfidence in given names is made up of judgments just as hollow as the\nconsequent praise or blame they are taken to warrant, is less commonly\nperceived, though there is a conspicuous indication of it in the\nsurprise or disappointment often manifested in the disclosure of an\nauthorship about which everybody has been making wrong guesses. No doubt\nif it had been discovered who wrote the 'Vestiges,' many an ingenious\nstructure of probabilities would have been spoiled, and some disgust\nmight have been felt for a real author who made comparatively so shabby\nan appearance of likelihood. It is this foolish trust in prepossessions,\nfounded on spurious evidence, which makes a medium of encouragement for\nthose who, happening to have the ear of the public, give other people's\nideas the advantage of appearing under their own well-received name,\nwhile any remonstrance from the real producer becomes an each person who\nhas paid complimentary tributes in the wrong place.\n\nHardly any kind of false reasoning is more ludicrous than this on the\nprobabilities of origination. It would be amusing to catechise the\nguessers as to their exact reasons for thinking their guess \"likely:\"\nwhy Hoopoe of John's has fixed on Toucan of Magdalen; why Shrike\nattributes its peculiar style to Buzzard, who has not hitherto been\nknown as a writer; why the fair Columba thinks it must belong to the\nreverend Merula; and why they are all alike disturbed in their previous\njudgment of its value by finding that it really came from Skunk, whom\nthey had either not thought of at all, or thought of as belonging to a\nspecies excluded by the nature of the case. Clearly they were all wrong\nin their notion of the specific conditions, which lay unexpectedly in\nthe small Skunk, and in him alone--in spite of his education nobody\nknows where, in spite of somebody's knowing his uncles and cousins, and\nin spite of nobody's knowing that he was cleverer than they thought him.\n\nSuch guesses remind one of a fabulist's imaginary council of animals\nassembled to consider what sort of creature had constructed a honeycomb\nfound and much tasted by Bruin and other epicures. The speakers all\nstarted from the probability that the maker was a bird, because this was\nthe quarter from which a wondrous nest might be expected; for the\nanimals at that time, knowing little of their own history, would have\nrejected as inconceivable the notion that a nest could be made by a\nfish; and as to the insects, they were not willingly received in society\nand their ways were little known. Several complimentary presumptions\nwere expressed that the honeycomb was due to one or the other admired\nand popular bird, and there was much fluttering on the part of the\nNightingale and Swallow, neither of whom gave a positive denial, their\nconfusion perhaps extending to their sense of identity; but the Owl\nhissed at this folly, arguing from his particular knowledge that the\nanimal which produced honey must be the Musk-rat, the wondrous nature of\nwhose secretions required no proof; and, in the powerful logical\nprocedure of the Owl, from musk to honey was but a step. Some\ndisturbance arose hereupon, for the Musk-rat began to make himself\nobtrusive, believing in the Owl's opinion of his powers, and feeling\nthat he could have produced the honey if he had thought of it; until an\nexperimental Butcher-bird proposed to anatomise him as a help to\ndecision. The hubbub increased, the opponents of the Musk-rat inquiring\nwho his ancestors were; until a diversion was created by an able\ndiscourse of the Macaw on structures generally, which he classified so\nas to include the honeycomb, entering into so much admirable exposition\nthat there was a prevalent sense of the honeycomb having probably been\nproduced by one who understood it so well. But Bruin, who had probably\neaten too much to listen with edification, grumbled in his low kind of\nlanguage, that \"Fine words butter no parsnips,\" by which he meant to say\nthat there was no new honey forthcoming.\n\nPerhaps the audience generally was beginning to tire, when the Fox\nentered with his snout dreadfully swollen, and reported that the\nbeneficent originator in question was the Wasp, which he had found much\nsmeared with undoubted honey, having applied his nose to it--whence\nindeed the able insect, perhaps justifiably irritated at what might seem\na sign of scepticism, had stung him with some severity, an infliction\nReynard could hardly regret, since the swelling of a snout normally so\ndelicate would corroborate his statement and satisfy the assembly that\nhe had really found the honey-creating genius.\n\nThe Fox's admitted acuteness, combined with the visible swelling, were\ntaken as undeniable evidence, and the revelation undoubtedly met a\ngeneral desire for information on a point of interest. Nevertheless,\nthere was a murmur the reverse of delighted, and the feelings of some\neminent animals were too strong for them: the Orang-outang's jaw dropped\nso as seriously to impair the vigour of his expression, the edifying\nPelican screamed and flapped her wings, the Owl hissed again, the Macaw\nbecame loudly incoherent, and the Gibbon gave his hysterical laugh;\nwhile the Hyaena, after indulging in a more splenetic guffaw, agitated\nthe question whether it would not be better to hush up the whole affair,\ninstead of giving public recognition to an insect whose produce, it was\nnow plain, had been much overestimated. But this narrow-spirited motion\nwas negatived by the sweet-toothed majority. A complimentary deputation\nto the Wasp was resolved on, and there was a confident hope that this\ndiplomatic measure would tell on the production of honey.\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\n\"SO YOUNG!\"\n\nGanymede was once a girlishly handsome precocious youth. That one cannot\nfor any considerable number of years go on being youthful, girlishly\nhandsome, and precocious, seems on consideration to be a statement as\nworthy of credit as the famous syllogistic conclusion, \"Socrates was\nmortal.\" But many circumstances have conspired to keep up in Ganymede\nthe illusion that he is surprisingly young. He was the last born of his\nfamily, and from his earliest memory was accustomed to be commended as\nsuch to the care of his elder brothers and sisters: he heard his mother\nspeak of him as her youngest darling with a loving pathos in her tone,\nwhich naturally suffused his own view of himself, and gave him the\nhabitual consciousness of being at once very young and very interesting.\nThen, the disclosure of his tender years was a constant matter of\nastonishment to strangers who had had proof of his precocious talents,\nand the astonishment extended to what is called the world at large when\nhe produced 'A Comparative Estimate of European Nations' before he was\nwell out of his teens. All comers, on a first interview, told him that\nhe was marvellously young, and some repeated the statement each time\nthey saw him; all critics who wrote about him called attention to the\nsame ground for wonder: his deficiencies and excesses were alike to be\naccounted for by the flattering fact of his youth, and his youth was the\ngolden background which set off his many-hued endowments. Here was\nalready enough to establish a strong association between his sense of\nidentity and his sense of being unusually young. But after this he\ndevised and founded an ingenious organisation for consolidating the\nliterary interests of all the four continents (subsequently including\nAustralasia and Polynesia), he himself presiding in the central office,\nwhich thus became a new theatre for the constantly repeated situation of\nan astonished stranger in the presence of a boldly scheming\nadministrator found to be remarkably young. If we imagine with due\ncharity the effect on Ganymede, we shall think it greatly to his credit\nthat he continued to feel the necessity of being something more than\nyoung, and did not sink by rapid degrees into a parallel of that\nmelancholy object, a superannuated youthful phenomenon. Happily he had\nenough of valid, active faculty to save him from that tragic fate. He\nhad not exhausted his fountain of eloquent opinion in his 'Comparative\nEstimate,' so as to feel himself, like some other juvenile celebrities,\nthe sad survivor of his own manifest destiny, or like one who has risen\ntoo early in the morning, and finds all the solid day turned into a\nfatigued afternoon. He has continued to be productive both of schemes\nand writings, being perhaps helped by the fact that his 'Comparative\nEstimate' did not greatly affect the currents of European thought, and\nleft him with the stimulating hope that he had not done his best, but\nmight yet produce what would make his youth more surprising than ever.\n\nI saw something of him through his Antinoues period, the time of rich\nchesnut locks, parted not by a visible white line, but by a shadowed\nfurrow from which they fell in massive ripples to right and left. In\nthese slim days he looked the younger for being rather below the middle\nsize, and though at last one perceived him contracting an indefinable\nair of self-consciousness, a slight exaggeration of the facial\nmovements, the attitudes, the little tricks, and the romance in\nshirt-collars, which must be expected from one who, in spite of his\nknowledge, was so exceedingly young, it was impossible to say that he\nwas making any great mistake about himself. He was only undergoing one\nform of a common moral disease: being strongly mirrored for himself in\nthe remark of others, he was getting to see his real characteristics as\na dramatic part, a type to which his doings were always in\ncorrespondence. Owing to my absence on travel and to other causes I had\nlost sight of him for several years, but such a separation between two\nwho have not missed each other seems in this busy century only a\npleasant reason, when they happen to meet again in some old accustomed\nhaunt, for the one who has stayed at home to be more communicative about\nhimself than he can well be to those who have all along been in his\nneighbourhood. He had married in the interval, and as if to keep up his\nsurprising youthfulness in all relations, he had taken a wife\nconsiderably older than himself. It would probably have seemed to him a\ndisturbing inversion of the natural order that any one very near to him\nshould have been younger than he, except his own children who, however\nyoung, would not necessarily hinder the normal surprise at the\nyouthfulness of their father. And if my glance had revealed my\nimpression on first seeing him again, he might have received a rather\ndisagreeable shock, which was far from my intention. My mind, having\nretained a very exact image of his former appearance, took note of\nunmistakeable changes such as a painter would certainly not have made by\nway of flattering his subject. He had lost his slimness, and that curved\nsolidity which might have adorned a taller man was a rather sarcastic\nthreat to his short figure. The English branch of the Teutonic race does\nnot produce many fat youths, and I have even heard an American lady say\nthat she was much \"disappointed\" at the moderate number and size of our\nfat men, considering their reputation in the United States; hence a\nstranger would now have been apt to remark that Ganymede was unusually\nplump for a distinguished writer, rather than unusually young. But how\nwas he to know this? Many long-standing prepossessions are as hard to be\ncorrected as a long-standing mispronunciation, against which the direct\nexperience of eye and ear is often powerless. And I could perceive that\nGanymede's inwrought sense of his surprising youthfulness had been\nstronger than the superficial reckoning of his years and the merely\noptical phenomena of the looking-glass. He now held a post under\nGovernment, and not only saw, like most subordinate functionaries, how\nill everything was managed, but also what were the changes that a high\nconstructive ability would dictate; and in mentioning to me his own\nspeeches and other efforts towards propagating reformatory views in his\ndepartment, he concluded by changing his tone to a sentimental head\nvoice and saying--\n\n\"But I am so young; people object to any prominence on my part; I can\nonly get myself heard anonymously, and when some attention has been\ndrawn the name is sure to creep out. The writer is known to be young,\nand things are none the forwarder.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"youth seems the only drawback that is sure to diminish.\nYou and I have seven years less of it than when we last met.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" returned Ganymede, as lightly as possible, at the same time\ncasting an observant glance over me, as if he were marking the effect of\nseven years on a person who had probably begun life with an old look,\nand even as an infant had given his countenance to that significant\ndoctrine, the transmigration of ancient souls into modern bodies.\n\nI left him on that occasion without any melancholy forecast that his\nillusion would be suddenly or painfully broken up. I saw that he was\nwell victualled and defended against a ten years' siege from ruthless\nfacts; and in the course of time observation convinced me that his\nresistance received considerable aid from without. Each of his written\nproductions, as it came out, was still commented on as the work of a\nvery young man. One critic, finding that he wanted solidity, charitably\nreferred to his youth as an excuse. Another, dazzled by his brilliancy,\nseemed to regard his youth as so wondrous that all other authors\nappeared decrepit by comparison, and their style such as might be looked\nfor from gentlemen of the old school. Able pens (according to a familiar\nmetaphor) appeared to shake their heads good-humouredly, implying that\nGanymede's crudities were pardonable in one so exceedingly young. Such\nunanimity amid diversity, which a distant posterity might take for\nevidence that on the point of age at least there could have been no\nmistake, was not really more difficult to account for than the\nprevalence of cotton in our fabrics. Ganymede had been first introduced\ninto the writing world as remarkably young, and it was no exceptional\nconsequence that the first deposit of information about him held its\nground against facts which, however open to observation, were not\nnecessarily thought of. It is not so easy, with our rates and taxes and\nneed for economy in all directions, to cast away an epithet or remark\nthat turns up cheaply, and to go in expensive search after more genuine\nsubstitutes. There is high Homeric precedent for keeping fast hold of an\nepithet under all changes of circumstance, and so the precocious author\nof the 'Comparative Estimate' heard the echoes repeating \"Young\nGanymede\" when an illiterate beholder at a railway station would have\ngiven him forty years at least. Besides, important elders, sachems of\nthe clubs and public meetings, had a genuine opinion of him as young\nenough to be checked for speech on subjects which they had spoken\nmistakenly about when he was in his cradle; and then, the midway parting\nof his crisp hair, not common among English committee-men, formed a\npresumption against the ripeness of his judgment which nothing but a\nspeedy baldness could have removed.\n\nIt is but fair to mention all these outward confirmations of Ganymede's\nillusion, which shows no signs of leaving him. It is true that he no\nlonger hears expressions of surprise at his youthfulness, on a first\nintroduction to an admiring reader; but this sort of external evidence\nhas become an unnecessary crutch to his habitual inward persuasion. His\nmanners, his costume, his suppositions of the impression he makes on\nothers, have all their former correspondence with the dramatic part of\nthe young genius. As to the incongruity of his contour and other little\naccidents of physique, he is probably no more aware that they will\naffect others as incongruities than Armida is conscious how much her\nrouge provokes our notice of her wrinkles, and causes us to mention\nsarcastically that motherly age which we should otherwise regard with\naffectionate reverence.\n\nBut let us be just enough to admit that there may be old-young coxcombs\nas well as old-young coquettes.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\nHOW WE COME TO GIVE OURSELVES FALSE TESTIMONIALS, AND BELIEVE IN THEM.\n\nIt is my way when I observe any instance of folly, any queer habit, any\nabsurd illusion, straightway to look for something of the same type in\nmyself, feeling sure that amid all differences there will be a certain\ncorrespondence; just as there is more or less correspondence in the\nnatural history even of continents widely apart, and of islands in\nopposite zones. No doubt men's minds differ in what we may call their\nclimate or share of solar energy, and a feeling or tendency which is\ncomparable to a panther in one may have no more imposing aspect than\nthat of a weasel in another: some are like a tropical habitat in which\nthe very ferns cast a mighty shadow, and the grasses are a dry ocean in\nwhich a hunter may be submerged; others like the chilly latitudes in\nwhich your forest-tree, fit elsewhere to prop a mine, is a pretty\nminiature suitable for fancy potting. The eccentric man might be\ntypified by the Australian fauna, refuting half our judicious\nassumptions of what nature allows. Still, whether fate commanded us to\nthatch our persons among the Eskimos or to choose the latest thing in\ntattooing among the Polynesian isles, our precious guide Comparison\nwould teach us in the first place by likeness, and our clue to further\nknowledge would be resemblance to what we already know. Hence, having a\nkeen interest in the natural history of my inward self, I pursue this\nplan I have mentioned of using my observation as a clue or lantern by\nwhich I detect small herbage or lurking life; or I take my neighbour in\nhis least becoming tricks or efforts as an opportunity for luminous\ndeduction concerning the figure the human genus makes in the specimen\nwhich I myself furnish.\n\nIntrospection which starts with the purpose of finding out one's own\nabsurdities is not likely to be very mischievous, yet of course it is\nnot free from dangers any more than breathing is, or the other functions\nthat keep us alive and active. To judge of others by oneself is in its\nmost innocent meaning the briefest expression for our only method of\nknowing mankind; yet, we perceive, it has come to mean in many cases\neither the vulgar mistake which reduces every man's value to the very\nlow figure at which the valuer himself happens to stand; or else, the\namiable illusion of the higher nature misled by a too generous\nconstruction of the lower. One cannot give a recipe for wise judgment:\nit resembles appropriate muscular action, which is attained by the\nmyriad lessons in nicety of balance and of aim that only practice can\ngive. The danger of the inverse procedure, judging of self by what one\nobserves in others, if it is carried on with much impartiality and\nkeenness of discernment, is that it has a laming effect, enfeebling the\nenergies of indignation and scorn, which are the proper scourges of\nwrong-doing and meanness, and which should continually feed the\nwholesome restraining power of public opinion. I respect the horsewhip\nwhen applied to the back of Cruelty, and think that he who applies it is\na more perfect human being because his outleap of indignation is not\nchecked by a too curious reflection on the nature of guilt--a more\nperfect human being because he more completely incorporates the best\nsocial life of the race, which can never be constituted by ideas that\nnullify action. This is the essence of Dante's sentiment (it is painful\nto think that he applies it very cruelly)--\n\n  \"E cortesia fu, lui esser villano\"[1]--\n\nand it is undeniable that a too intense consciousness of one's kinship\nwith all frailties and vices undermines the active heroism which battles\nagainst wrong.\n\nBut certainly nature has taken care that this danger should not at\npresent be very threatening. One could not fairly describe the\ngenerality of one's neighbours as too lucidly aware of manifesting in\ntheir own persons the weaknesses which they observe in the rest of her\nMajesty's subjects; on the contrary, a hasty conclusion as to schemes of\nProvidence might lead to the supposition that one man was intended to\ncorrect another by being most intolerant of the ugly quality or trick\nwhich he himself possesses. Doubtless philosophers will be able to\nexplain how it must necessarily be so, but pending the full extension of\nthe _a priori_ method, which will show that only blockheads could expect\nanything to be otherwise, it does seem surprising that Heloisa should be\ndisgusted at Laura's attempts to disguise her age, attempts which she\nrecognises so thoroughly because they enter into her own practice; that\nSemper, who often responds at public dinners and proposes resolutions on\nplatforms, though he has a trying gestation of every speech and a bad\ntime for himself and others at every delivery, should yet remark\npitilessly on the folly of precisely the same course of action in\nUbique; that Aliquis, who lets no attack on himself pass unnoticed, and\nfor every handful of gravel against his windows sends a stone in reply,\nshould deplore the ill-advised retorts of Quispiam, who does not\nperceive that to show oneself angry with an adversary is to gratify him.\nTo be unaware of our own little tricks of manner or our own mental\nblemishes and excesses is a comprehensible unconsciousness; the puzzling\nfact is that people should apparently take no account of their\ndeliberate actions, and should expect them to be equally ignored by\nothers. It is an inversion of the accepted order: _there_ it is the\nphrases that are official and the conduct or privately manifested\nsentiment that is taken to be real; _here_ it seems that the practice is\ntaken to be official and entirely nullified by the verbal representation\nwhich contradicts it. The thief making a vow to heaven of full\nrestitution and whispering some reservations, expecting to cheat\nOmniscience by an \"aside,\" is hardly more ludicrous than the many ladies\nand gentlemen who have more belief, and expect others to have it, in\ntheir own statement about their habitual doings than in the\ncontradictory fact which is patent in the daylight. One reason of the\nabsurdity is that we are led by a tradition about ourselves, so that\nlong after a man has practically departed from a rule or principle, he\ncontinues innocently to state it as a true description of his\npractice--just as he has a long tradition that he is not an old\ngentleman, and is startled when he is seventy at overhearing himself\ncalled by an epithet which he has only applied to others.\n\n[Footnote 1: Inferno, xxxii. 150.]\n\n\"A person with your tendency of constitution should take as little sugar\nas possible,\" said Pilulus to Bovis somewhere in the darker decades of\nthis century. \"It has made a great difference to Avis since he took my\nadvice in that matter: he used to consume half a pound a-day.\"\n\n\"God bless me!\" cries Bovis. \"I take very little sugar myself.\"\n\n\"Twenty-six large lumps every day of your life, Mr Bovis,\" says his\nwife.\n\n\"No such thing!\" exclaims Bovis.\n\n\"You drop them into your tea, coffee, and whisky yourself, my dear, and\nI count them.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" laughs Bovis, turning to Pilulus, that they may exchange a\nglance of mutual amusement at a woman's inaccuracy.\n\nBut she happened to be right. Bovis had never said inwardly that he\nwould take a large allowance of sugar, and he had the tradition about\nhimself that he was a man of the most moderate habits; hence, with this\nconviction, he was naturally disgusted at the saccharine excesses of\nAvis.\n\nI have sometimes thought that this facility of men in believing that\nthey are still what they once meant to be--this undisturbed\nappropriation of a traditional character which is often but a melancholy\nrelic of early resolutions, like the worn and soiled testimonial to\nsoberness and honesty carried in the pocket of a tippler whom the need\nof a dram has driven into peculation--may sometimes diminish the\nturpitude of what seems a flat, barefaced falsehood. It is notorious\nthat a man may go on uttering false assertions about his own acts till\nhe at last believes in them: is it not possible that sometimes in the\nvery first utterance there may be a shade of creed-reciting belief, a\nreproduction of a traditional self which is clung to against all\nevidence? There is no knowing all the disguises of the lying serpent.\n\nWhen we come to examine in detail what is the sane mind in the sane\nbody, the final test of completeness seems to be a security of\ndistinction between what we have professed and what we have done; what\nwe have aimed at and what we have achieved; what we have invented and\nwhat we have witnessed or had evidenced to us; what we think and feel in\nthe present and what we thought and felt in the past.\n\nI know that there is a common prejudice which regards the habitual\nconfusion of _now_ and _then_, of _it was_ and _it is_, of _it seemed\nso_ and _I should like it to be so_, as a mark of high imaginative\nendowment, while the power of precise statement and description is rated\nlower, as the attitude of an everyday prosaic mind. High imagination is\noften assigned or claimed as if it were a ready activity in fabricating\nextravagances such as are presented by fevered dreams, or as if its\npossessors were in that state of inability to give credible testimony\nwhich would warrant their exclusion from the class of acceptable\nwitnesses in a court of justice; so that a creative genius might fairly\nbe subjected to the disability which some laws have stamped on dicers,\nslaves, and other classes whose position was held perverting to their\nsense of social responsibility.\n\nThis endowment of mental confusion is often boasted of by persons whose\nimaginativeness would not otherwise be known, unless it were by the slow\nprocess of detecting that their descriptions and narratives were not to\nbe trusted. Callista is always ready to testify of herself that she is\nan imaginative person, and sometimes adds in illustration, that if she\nhad taken a walk and seen an old heap of stones on her way, the account\nshe would give on returning would include many pleasing particulars of\nher own invention, transforming the simple heap into an interesting\ncastellated ruin. This creative freedom is all very well in the right\nplace, but before I can grant it to be a sign of unusual mental power, I\nmust inquire whether, on being requested to give a precise description\nof what she saw, she would be able to cast aside her arbitrary\ncombinations and recover the objects she really perceived so as to make\nthem recognisable by another person who passed the same way. Otherwise\nher glorifying imagination is not an addition to the fundamental power\nof strong, discerning perception, but a cheaper substitute. And, in\nfact, I find on listening to Callista's conversation, that she has a\nvery lax conception even of common objects, and an equally lax memory of\nevents. It seems of no consequence to her whether she shall say that a\nstone is overgrown with moss or with lichen, that a building is of\nsandstone or of granite, that Meliboeus once forgot to put on his cravat\nor that he always appears without it; that everybody says so, or that\none stock-broker's wife said so yesterday; that Philemon praised\nEuphemia up to the skies, or that he denied knowing any particular evil\nof her. She is one of those respectable witnesses who would testify to\nthe exact moment of an apparition, because any desirable moment will be\nas exact as another to her remembrance; or who would be the most worthy\nto witness the action of spirits on slates and tables because the action\nof limbs would not probably arrest her attention. She would describe the\nsurprising phenomena exhibited by the powerful Medium with the same\nfreedom that she vaunted in relation to the old heap of stones. Her\nsupposed imaginativeness is simply a very usual lack of discriminating\nperception, accompanied with a less usual activity of misrepresentation,\nwhich, if it had been a little more intense, or had been stimulated by\ncircumstance, might have made her a profuse writer unchecked by the\ntroublesome need of veracity.\n\nThese characteristics are the very opposite of such as yield a fine\nimagination, which is always based on a keen vision, a keen\nconsciousness of what _is_, and carries the store of definite knowledge\nas material for the construction of its inward visions. Witness Dante,\nwho is at once the most precise and homely in his reproduction of actual\nobjects, and the most soaringly at large in his imaginative\ncombinations. On a much lower level we distinguish the hyperbole and\nrapid development in descriptions of persons and events which are lit up\nby humorous intention in the speaker--we distinguish this charming play\nof intelligence which resembles musical improvisation on a given motive,\nwhere the farthest sweep of curve is looped into relevancy by an\ninstinctive method, from the florid inaccuracy or helpless exaggeration\nwhich is really something commoner than the correct simplicity often\ndepreciated as prosaic.\n\nEven if high imagination were to be identified with illusion, there\nwould be the same sort of difference between the imperial wealth of\nillusion which is informed by industrious submissive observation and the\ntrumpery stage-property illusion which depends on the ill-defined\nimpressions gathered by capricious inclination, as there is between a\ngood and a bad picture of the Last Judgment. In both these the subject\nis a combination never actually witnessed, and in the good picture the\ngeneral combination may be of surpassing boldness; but on examination it\nis seen that the separate elements have been closely studied from real\nobjects. And even where we find the charm of ideal elevation with wrong\ndrawing and fantastic colour, the charm is dependent on the selective\nsensibility of the painter to certain real delicacies of form which\nconfer the expression he longed to render; for apart from this basis of\nan effect perceived in common, there could be no conveyance of aesthetic\nmeaning by the painter to the beholder. In this sense it is as true to\nsay of Fra Angelico's Coronation of the Virgin, that it has a strain of\nreality, as to say so of a portrait by Rembrandt, which also has its\nstrain of ideal elevation due to Rembrandt's virile selective\nsensibility. To correct such self-flatterers as Callista, it is worth\nrepeating that powerful imagination is not false outward vision, but\nintense inward representation, and a creative energy constantly fed by\nsusceptibility to the veriest minutiae of experience, which it\nreproduces and constructs in fresh and fresh wholes; not the habitual\nconfusion of provable fact with the fictions of fancy and transient\ninclination, but a breadth of ideal association which informs every\nmaterial object, every incidental fact with far-reaching memories and\nstored residues of passion, bringing into new light the less obvious\nrelations of human existence. The illusion to which it is liable is not\nthat of habitually taking duck-ponds for lilied pools, but of being more\nor less transiently and in varying degrees so absorbed in ideal vision\nas to lose the consciousness of surrounding objects or occurrences; and\nwhen that rapt condition is past, the sane genius discriminates clearly\nbetween what has been given in this parenthetic state of excitement, and\nwhat he has known, and may count on, in the ordinary world of\nexperience. Dante seems to have expressed these conditions perfectly in\nthat passage of the _Purgatorio_ where, after a triple vision which has\nmade him forget his surroundings, he says--\n\n  \"Quando l'anima mia torno di fuori\n    Alle cose che son fuor di lei vere,\n    Io riconobbi i miei non falsi errori.\"--(c xv)\n\nHe distinguishes the ideal truth of his entranced vision from the series\nof external facts to which his consciousness had returned. Isaiah gives\nus the date of his vision in the Temple--\"the year that King Uzziah\ndied\"--and if afterwards the mighty-winged seraphim were present with\nhim as he trod the street, he doubtless knew them for images of memory,\nand did not cry \"Look!\" to the passers-by.\n\nCertainly the seer, whether prophet, philosopher, scientific discoverer,\nor poet, may happen to be rather mad: his powers may have been used up,\nlike Don Quixote's, in their visionary or theoretic constructions, so\nthat the reports of common-sense fail to affect him, or the continuous\nstrain of excitement may have robbed his mind of its elasticity. It is\nhard for our frail mortality to carry the burthen of greatness with\nsteady gait and full alacrity of perception. But he is the strongest\nseer who can support the stress of creative energy and yet keep that\nsanity of expectation which consists in distinguishing, as Dante does,\nbetween the _cose che son vere_ outside the individual mind, and the\n_non falsi errori_ which are the revelations of true imaginative power.\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\nTHE TOO READY WRITER\n\nOne who talks too much, hindering the rest of the company from taking\ntheir turn, and apparently seeing no reason why they should not rather\ndesire to know his opinion or experience in relation to all subjects, or\nat least to renounce the discussion of any topic where he can make no\nfigure, has never been praised for this industrious monopoly of work\nwhich others would willingly have shared in. However various and\nbrilliant his talk may be, we suspect him of impoverishing us by\nexcluding the contributions of other minds, which attract our curiosity\nthe more because he has shut them up in silence. Besides, we get tired\nof a \"manner\" in conversation as in painting, when one theme after\nanother is treated with the same lines and touches. I begin with a\nliking for an estimable master, but by the time he has stretched his\ninterpretation of the world unbrokenly along a palatial gallery, I have\nhad what the cautious Scotch mind would call \"enough\" of him. There is\nmonotony and narrowness already to spare in my own identity; what comes\nto me from without should be larger and more impartial than the judgment\nof any single interpreter. On this ground even a modest person, without\npower or will to shine in the conversation, may easily find the\npredominating talker a nuisance, while those who are full of matter on\nspecial topics are continually detecting miserably thin places in the\nweb of that information which he will not desist from imparting. Nobody\nthat I know of ever proposed a testimonial to a man for thus\nvolunteering the whole expense of the conversation.\n\nWhy is there a different standard of judgment with regard to a writer\nwho plays much the same part in literature as the excessive talker plays\nin what is traditionally called conversation? The busy Adrastus, whose\nprofessional engagements might seem more than enough for the nervous\nenergy of one man, and who yet finds time to print essays on the chief\ncurrent subjects, from the tri-lingual inscriptions, or the Idea of the\nInfinite among the prehistoric Lapps, to the Colorado beetle and the\ngrape disease in the south of France, is generally praised if not\nadmired for the breadth of his mental range and his gigantic powers of\nwork. Poor Theron, who has some original ideas on a subject to which he\nhas given years of research and meditation, has been waiting anxiously\nfrom month to month to see whether his condensed exposition will find a\nplace in the next advertised programme, but sees it, on the contrary,\nregularly excluded, and twice the space he asked for filled with the\ncopious brew of Adrastus, whose name carries custom like a celebrated\ntrade-mark. Why should the eager haste to tell what he thinks on the\nshortest notice, as if his opinion were a needed preliminary to\ndiscussion, get a man the reputation of being a conceited bore in\nconversation, when nobody blames the same tendency if it shows itself in\nprint? The excessive talker can only be in one gathering at a time, and\nthere is the comfort of thinking that everywhere else other\nfellow-citizens who have something to say may get a chance of delivering\nthemselves; but the exorbitant writer can occupy space and spread over\nit the more or less agreeable flavour of his mind in four \"mediums\" at\nonce, and on subjects taken from the four winds. Such restless and\nversatile occupants of literary space and time should have lived earlier\nwhen the world wanted summaries of all extant knowledge, and this\nknowledge being small, there was the more room for commentary and\nconjecture. They might have played the part of an Isidor of Seville or a\nVincent of Beauvais brilliantly, and the willingness to write everything\nthemselves would have been strictly in place. In the present day, the\nbusy retailer of other people's knowledge which he has spoiled in the\nhandling, the restless guesser and commentator, the importunate hawker\nof undesirable superfluities, the everlasting word-compeller who rises\nearly in the morning to praise what the world has already glorified, or\nmakes himself haggard at night in writing out his dissent from what\nnobody ever believed, is not simply \"gratis anhelans, multa agendo nihil\nagens\"--he is an obstruction. Like an incompetent architect with too\nmuch interest at his back, he obtrudes his ill-considered work where\nplace ought to have been left to better men.\n\nIs it out of the question that we should entertain some scruple about\nmixing our own flavour, as of the too cheap and insistent nutmeg, with\nthat of every great writer and every great subject?--especially when our\nflavour is all we have to give, the matter or knowledge having been\nalready given by somebody else. What if we were only like the Spanish\nwine-skins which impress the innocent stranger with the notion that the\nSpanish grape has naturally a taste of leather? One could wish that even\nthe greatest minds should leave some themes unhandled, or at least leave\nus no more than a paragraph or two on them to show how well they did in\nnot being more lengthy.\n\nSuch entertainment of scruple can hardly be expected from the young; but\nhappily their readiness to mirror the universe anew for the rest of\nmankind is not encouraged by easy publicity. In the vivacious Pepin I\nhave often seen the image of my early youth, when it seemed to me\nastonishing that the philosophers had left so many difficulties\nunsolved, and that so many great themes had raised no great poet to\ntreat them. I had an elated sense that I should find my brain full of\ntheoretic clues when I looked for them, and that wherever a poet had not\ndone what I expected, it was for want of my insight. Not knowing what\nhad been said about the play of Romeo and Juliet, I felt myself capable\nof writing something original on its blemishes and beauties. In relation\nto all subjects I had a joyous consciousness of that ability which is\nprior to knowledge, and of only needing to apply myself in order to\nmaster any task--to conciliate philosophers whose systems were at\npresent but dimly known to me, to estimate foreign poets whom I had not\nyet read, to show up mistakes in an historical monograph that roused my\ninterest in an epoch which I had been hitherto ignorant of, when I\nshould once have had time to verify my views of probability by looking\ninto an encyclopaedia. So Pepin; save only that he is industrious while\nI was idle. Like the astronomer in Rasselas, I swayed the universe in my\nconsciousness without making any difference outside me; whereas Pepin,\nwhile feeling himself powerful with the stars in their courses, really\nraises some dust here below. He is no longer in his spring-tide, but\nhaving been always busy he has been obliged to use his first impressions\nas if they were deliberate opinions, and to range himself on the\ncorresponding side in ignorance of much that he commits himself to; so\nthat he retains some characteristics of a comparatively tender age, and\namong them a certain surprise that there have not been more persons\nequal to himself. Perhaps it is unfortunate for him that he early gained\na hearing, or at least a place in print, and was thus encouraged in\nacquiring a fixed habit of writing, to the exclusion of any other\nbread-winning pursuit. He is already to be classed as a \"general\nwriter,\" corresponding to the comprehensive wants of the \"general\nreader,\" and with this industry on his hands it is not enough for him to\nkeep up the ingenuous self-reliance of youth: he finds himself under an\nobligation to be skilled in various methods of seeming to know; and\nhaving habitually expressed himself before he was convinced, his\ninterest in all subjects is chiefly to ascertain that he has not made a\nmistake, and to feel his infallibility confirmed. That impulse to\ndecide, that vague sense of being able to achieve the unattempted, that\ndream of aerial unlimited movement at will without feet or wings, which\nwere once but the joyous mounting of young sap, are already taking shape\nas unalterable woody fibre: the impulse has hardened into \"style,\" and\ninto a pattern of peremptory sentences; the sense of ability in the\npresence of other men's failures is turning into the official arrogance\nof one who habitually issues directions which he has never himself been\ncalled on to execute; the dreamy buoyancy of the stripling has taken on\na fatal sort of reality in written pretensions which carry consequences.\nHe is on the way to become like the loud-buzzing, bouncing Bombus who\ncombines conceited illusions enough to supply several patients in a\nlunatic asylum with the freedom to show himself at large in various\nforms of print. If one who takes himself for the telegraphic centre of\nall American wires is to be confined as unfit to transact affairs, what\nshall we say to the man who believes himself in possession of the\nunexpressed motives and designs dwelling in the breasts of all\nsovereigns and all politicians? And I grieve to think that poor Pepin,\nthough less political, may by-and-by manifest a persuasion hardly more\nsane, for he is beginning to explain people's writing by what he does\nnot know about them. Yet he was once at the comparatively innocent stage\nwhich I have confessed to be that of my own early astonishment at my\npowerful originality; and copying the just humility of the old Puritan,\nI may say, \"But for the grace of discouragement, this coxcombry might\nhave been mine.\"\n\nPepin made for himself a necessity of writing (and getting printed)\nbefore he had considered whether he had the knowledge or belief that\nwould furnish eligible matter. At first perhaps the necessity galled him\na little, but it is now as easily borne, nay, is as irrepressible a\nhabit as the outpouring of inconsiderate talk. He is gradually being\ncondemned to have no genuine impressions, no direct consciousness of\nenjoyment or the reverse from the quality of what is before him: his\nperceptions are continually arranging themselves in forms suitable to a\nprinted judgment, and hence they will often turn out to be as much to\nthe purpose if they are written without any direct contemplation of the\nobject, and are guided by a few external conditions which serve to\nclassify it for him. In this way he is irrevocably losing the faculty of\naccurate mental vision: having bound himself to express judgments which\nwill satisfy some other demands than that of veracity, he has blunted\nhis perceptions by continual preoccupation. We cannot command veracity\nat will: the power of seeing and reporting truly is a form of health\nthat has to be delicately guarded, and as an ancient Rabbi has solemnly\nsaid, \"The penalty of untruth is untruth.\" But Pepin is only a mild\nexample of the fact that incessant writing with a view to printing\ncarries internal consequences which have often the nature of disease.\nAnd however unpractical it may be held to consider whether we have\nanything to print which it is good for the world to read, or which has\nnot been better said before, it will perhaps be allowed to be worth\nconsidering what effect the printing may have on ourselves. Clearly\nthere is a sort of writing which helps to keep the writer in a\nridiculously contented ignorance; raising in him continually the sense\nof having delivered himself effectively, so that the acquirement of more\nthorough knowledge seems as superfluous as the purchase of costume for a\npast occasion. He has invested his vanity (perhaps his hope of income)\nin his own shallownesses and mistakes, and must desire their prosperity.\nLike the professional prophet, he learns to be glad of the harm that\nkeeps up his credit, and to be sorry for the good that contradicts him.\nIt is hard enough for any of us, amid the changing winds of fortune and\nthe hurly-burly of events, to keep quite clear of a gladness which is\nanother's calamity; but one may choose not to enter on a course which\nwill turn such gladness into a fixed habit of mind, committing ourselves\nto be continually pleased that others should appear to be wrong in order\nthat we may have the air of being right.\n\nIn some cases, perhaps, it might be urged that Pepin has remained the\nmore self-contented because he has _not_ written everything he believed\nhimself capable of. He once asked me to read a sort of programme of the\nspecies of romance which he should think it worth while to write--a\nspecies which he contrasted in strong terms with the productions of\nillustrious but overrated authors in this branch. Pepin's romance was to\npresent the splendours of the Roman Empire at the culmination of its\ngrandeur, when decadence was spiritually but not visibly imminent: it\nwas to show the workings of human passion in the most pregnant and\nexalted of human circumstances, the designs of statesmen, the\ninterfusion of philosophies, the rural relaxation and converse of\nimmortal poets, the majestic triumphs of warriors, the mingling of the\nquaint and sublime in religious ceremony, the gorgeous delirium of\ngladiatorial shows, and under all the secretly working leaven of\nChristianity. Such a romance would not call the attention of society to\nthe dialect of stable-boys, the low habits of rustics, the vulgarity of\nsmall schoolmasters, the manners of men in livery, or to any other form\nof uneducated talk and sentiments: its characters would have virtues and\nvices alike on the grand scale, and would express themselves in an\nEnglish representing the discourse of the most powerful minds in the\nbest Latin, or possibly Greek, when there occurred a scene with a Greek\nphilosopher on a visit to Rome or resident there as a teacher. In this\nway Pepin would do in fiction what had never been done before: something\nnot at all like 'Rienzi' or 'Notre Dame de Paris,' or any other attempt\nof that kind; but something at once more penetrating and more\nmagnificent, more passionate and more philosophical, more panoramic yet\nmore select: something that would present a conception of a gigantic\nperiod; in short something truly Roman and world-historical.\n\nWhen Pepin gave me this programme to read he was much younger than at\npresent. Some slight success in another vein diverted him from the\nproduction of panoramic and select romance, and the experience of not\nhaving tried to carry out his programme has naturally made him more\nbiting and sarcastic on the failures of those who have actually written\nromances without apparently having had a glimpse of a conception equal\nto his. Indeed, I am often comparing his rather touchingly inflated\n_naivete_ as of a small young person walking on tiptoe while he is\ntalking of elevated things, at the time when he felt himself the author\nof that unwritten romance, with his present epigrammatic curtness and\naffectation of power kept strictly in reserve. His paragraphs now seem\nto have a bitter smile in them, from the consciousness of a mind too\npenetrating to accept any other man's ideas, and too equally competent\nin all directions to seclude his power in any one form of creation, but\nrather fitted to hang over them all as a lamp of guidance to the\nstumblers below. You perceive how proud he is of not being indebted to\nany writer: even with the dead he is on the creditor's side, for he is\ndoing them the service of letting the world know what they meant better\nthan those poor pre-Pepinians themselves had any means of doing, and he\ntreats the mighty shades very cavalierly.\n\nIs this fellow--citizen of ours, considered simply in the light of a\nbaptised Christian and tax-paying Englishman, really as madly\nconceited, as empty of reverential feeling, as unveracious and careless\nof justice, as full of catch-penny devices and stagey attitudinising as\non examination his writing shows itself to be? By no means. He has\narrived at his present pass in \"the literary calling\" through the\nself-imposed obligation to give himself a manner which would convey the\nimpression of superior knowledge and ability. He is much worthier and\nmore admirable than his written productions, because the moral aspects\nexhibited in his writing are felt to be ridiculous or disgraceful in the\npersonal relations of life. In blaming Pepin's writing we are accusing\nthe public conscience, which is so lax and ill informed on the momentous\nbearings of authorship that it sanctions the total absence of scruple in\nundertaking and prosecuting what should be the best warranted of\nvocations.\n\nHence I still accept friendly relations with Pepin, for he has much\nprivate amiability, and though he probably thinks of me as a man of\nslender talents, without rapidity of _coup d'oeil_ and with no\ncompensatory penetration, he meets me very cordially, and would not, I\nam sure, willingly pain me in conversation by crudely declaring his low\nestimate of my capacity. Yet I have often known him to insult my betters\nand contribute (perhaps unreflectingly) to encourage injurious\nconceptions of them--but that was done in the course of his professional\nwriting, and the public conscience still leaves such writing nearly on\nthe level of the Merry-Andrew's dress, which permits an impudent\ndeportment and extraordinary gambols to one who in his ordinary clothing\nshows himself the decent father of a family.\n\n\n\n\nXV.\n\n\nDISEASES OF SMALL AUTHORSHIP\n\nParticular callings, it is known, encourage particular diseases. There\nis a painter's colic: the Sheffield grinder falls a victim to the\ninhalation of steel dust: clergymen so often have a certain kind of sore\nthroat that this otherwise secular ailment gets named after them. And\nperhaps, if we were to inquire, we should find a similar relation\nbetween certain moral ailments and these various occupations, though\nhere in the case of clergymen there would be specific differences: the\npoor curate, equally with the rector, is liable to clergyman's sore\nthroat, but he would probably be found free from the chronic moral\nailments encouraged by the possession of glebe and those higher chances\nof preferment which follow on having a good position already. On the\nother hand, the poor curate might have severe attacks of calculating\nexpectancy concerning parishioners' turkeys, cheeses, and fat geese, or\nof uneasy rivalry for the donations of clerical charities.\n\nAuthors are so miscellaneous a class that\ntheir personified diseases, physical and moral,\nmight include the whole procession of human\ndisorders, led by dyspepsia and ending in\nmadness--the awful Dumb Show of a world-historic\ntragedy. Take a large enough area\nof human life and all comedy melts into\ntragedy, like the Fool's part by the side of\nLear. The chief scenes get filled with erring\nheroes, guileful usurpers, persecuted discoverers,\ndying deliverers: everywhere the\nprotagonist has a part pregnant with doom.\nThe comedy sinks to an accessory, and if there\nare loud laughs they seem a convulsive transition\nfrom sobs; or if the comedy is touched\nwith a gentle lovingness, the panoramic scene\nis one where\n\n        \"Sadness is a kind of mirth\n  So mingled as if mirth did make us sad\n  And sadness merry.\"[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: Two Noble Kinsmen.]\n\nBut I did not set out on the wide survey that would carry me into\ntragedy, and in fact had nothing more serious in my mind than certain\nsmall chronic ailments that come of small authorship. I was thinking\nprincipally of Vorticella, who flourished in my youth not only as a\nportly lady walking in silk attire, but also as the authoress of a book\nentitled 'The Channel Islands, with Notes and an Appendix.' I would by\nno means make it a reproach to her that she wrote no more than one book;\non the contrary, her stopping there seems to me a laudable example. What\none would have wished, after experience, was that she had refrained from\nproducing even that single volume, and thus from giving her\nself-importance a troublesome kind of double incorporation which became\noppressive to her acquaintances, and set up in herself one of those\nslight chronic forms of disease to which I have just referred. She lived\nin the considerable provincial town of Pumpiter, which had its own\nnewspaper press, with the usual divisions of political partisanship and\nthe usual varieties of literary criticism--the florid and allusive, the\n_staccato_ and peremptory, the clairvoyant and prophetic, the safe and\npattern-phrased, or what one might call \"the many-a-long-day style.\"\n\nVorticella being the wife of an important townsman had naturally the\nsatisfaction of seeing 'The Channel Islands' reviewed by all the organs\nof Pumpiter opinion, and their articles or paragraphs held as naturally\nthe opening pages in the elegantly bound album prepared by her for the\nreception of \"critical opinions.\" This ornamental volume lay on a\nspecial table in her drawing-room close to the still more gorgeously\nbound work of which it was the significant effect, and every guest was\nallowed the privilege of reading what had been said of the authoress and\nher work in the 'Pumpiter Gazette and Literary Watchman,' the 'Pumpshire\nPost,' the 'Church Clock,' the 'Independent Monitor,' and the lively but\njudicious publication known as the 'Medley Pie;' to be followed up, if\nhe chose, by the instructive perusal of the strikingly confirmatory\njudgments, sometimes concurrent in the very phrases, of journals from\nthe most distant counties; as the 'Latchgate Argus,' the Penllwy\nUniverse,' the 'Cockaleekie Advertiser,' the 'Goodwin Sands Opinion,'\nand the 'Land's End Times.'\n\nI had friends in Pumpiter and occasionally paid a long visit there. When\nI called on Vorticella, who had a cousinship with my hosts, she had to\nexcuse herself because a message claimed her attention for eight or ten\nminutes, and handing me the album of critical opinions said, with a\ncertain emphasis which, considering my youth, was highly complimentary,\nthat she would really like me to read what I should find there. This\nseemed a permissive politeness which I could not feel to be an\noppression, and I ran my eyes over the dozen pages, each with a strip or\nislet of newspaper in the centre, with that freedom of mind (in my case\nmeaning freedom to forget) which would be a perilous way of preparing\nfor examination. This _ad libitum_ perusal had its interest for me. The\nprivate truth being that I had not read 'The Channel Islands,' I was\namazed at the variety of matter which the volume must contain to have\nimpressed these different judges with the writer's surpassing capacity\nto handle almost all branches of inquiry and all forms of presentation.\nIn Jersey she had shown herself an historian, in Guernsey a poetess, in\nAlderney a political economist, and in Sark a humorist: there were\nsketches of character scattered through the pages which might put our\n\"fictionists\" to the blush; the style was eloquent and racy, studded\nwith gems of felicitous remark; and the moral spirit throughout was so\nsuperior that, said one, \"the recording angel\" (who is not supposed to\ntake account of literature as such) \"would assuredly set down the work\nas a deed of religion.\" The force of this eulogy on the part of several\nreviewers was much heightened by the incidental evidence of their\nfastidious and severe taste, which seemed to suffer considerably from\nthe imperfections of our chief writers, even the dead and canonised: one\nafflicted them with the smell of oil, another lacked erudition and\nattempted (though vainly) to dazzle them with trivial conceits, one\nwanted to be more philosophical than nature had made him, another in\nattempting to be comic produced the melancholy effect of a half-starved\nMerry-Andrew; while one and all, from the author of the 'Areopagitica'\ndownwards, had faults of style which must have made an able hand in the\n'Latchgate Argus' shake the many-glanced head belonging thereto with a\nsmile of compassionate disapproval. Not so the authoress of 'The Channel\nIslands:' Vorticella and Shakspere were allowed to be faultless. I\ngathered that no blemishes were observable in the work of this\naccomplished writer, and the repeated information that she was \"second\nto none\" seemed after this superfluous. Her thick octavo--notes,\nappendix and all--was unflagging from beginning to end; and the 'Land's\nEnd Times,' using a rather dangerous rhetorical figure, recommended you\nnot to take up the volume unless you had leisure to finish it at a\nsitting. It had given one writer more pleasure than he had had for many\na long day--a sentence which had a melancholy resonance, suggesting a\nlife of studious languor such as all previous achievements of the human\nmind failed to stimulate into enjoyment. I think the collection of\ncritical opinions wound up with this sentence, and I had turned back to\nlook at the lithographed sketch of the authoress which fronted the first\npage of the album, when the fair original re-entered and I laid down the\nvolume on its appropriate table.\n\n\"Well, what do you think of them?\" said Vorticella, with an emphasis\nwhich had some significance unperceived by me. \"I know you are a great\nstudent. Give me _your_ opinion of these opinions.\"\n\n\"They must be very gratifying to you,\" I answered with a little\nconfusion, for I perceived that I might easily mistake my footing, and I\nbegan to have a presentiment of an examination for which I was by no\nmeans crammed.\n\n\"On the whole--yes,\" said Vorticella, in a tone of concession. \"A few of\nthe notices are written with some pains, but not one of them has really\ngrappled with the chief idea in the appendix. I don't know whether you\nhave studied political economy, but you saw what I said on page 398\nabout the Jersey fisheries?\"\n\nI bowed--I confess it--with the mean hope that this movement in the nape\nof my neck would be taken as sufficient proof that I had read, marked,\nand learned. I do not forgive myself for this pantomimic falsehood, but\nI was young and morally timorous, and Vorticella's personality had an\neffect on me something like that of a powerful mesmeriser when he\ndirects all his ten fingers towards your eyes, as unpleasantly visible\nducts for the invisible stream. I felt a great power of contempt in her,\nif I did not come up to her expectations.\n\n\"Well,\" she resumed, \"you observe that not one of them has taken up that\nargument. But I hope I convinced you about the drag-nets?\"\n\nHere was a judgment on me. Orientally speaking, I had lifted up my foot\non the steep descent of falsity and was compelled to set it down on a\nlower level. \"I should think you must be right,\" said I, inwardly\nresolving that on the next topic I would tell the truth.\n\n\"I _know_ that I am right,\" said Vorticella. \"The fact is that no critic\nin this town is fit to meddle with such subjects, unless it be Volvox,\nand he, with all his command of language, is very superficial. It is\nVolvox who writes in the 'Monitor,' I hope you noticed how he\ncontradicts himself?\"\n\nMy resolution, helped by the equivalence of dangers, stoutly prevailed,\nand I said, \"No.\"\n\n\"No! I am surprised. He is the only one who finds fault with me. He is\na Dissenter, you know. The 'Monitor' is the Dissenters' organ, but my\nhusband has been so useful to them in municipal affairs that they would\nnot venture to run my book down; they feel obliged to tell the truth\nabout me. Still Volvox betrays himself. After praising me for my\npenetration and accuracy, he presently says I have allowed myself to be\nimposed upon and have let my active imagination run away with me. That\nis like his dissenting impertinence. Active my imagination may be, but I\nhave it under control. Little Vibrio, who writes the playful notice in\nthe 'Medley Pie,' has a clever hit at Volvox in that passage about the\nsteeplechase of imagination, where the loser wants to make it appear\nthat the winner was only run away with. But if you did not notice\nVolvox's self-contradiction you would not see the point,\" added\nVorticella, with rather a chilling intonation. \"Or perhaps you did not\nread the 'Medley Pie' notice? That is a pity. Do take up the book again.\nVibrio is a poor little tippling creature, but, as Mr Carlyle would say,\nhe has an eye, and he is always lively.\"\n\nI did take up the book again, and read as demanded.\n\n\"It is very ingenious,\" said I, really appreciating the difficulty of\nbeing lively in this connection: it seemed even more wonderful than that\na Vibrio should have an eye.\n\n\"You are probably surprised to see no notices from the London press,\"\nsaid Vorticella. \"I have one--a very remarkable one. But I reserve it\nuntil the others have spoken, and then I shall introduce it to wind up.\nI shall have them reprinted, of course, and inserted in future copies.\nThis from the 'Candelabrum' is only eight lines in length, but full of\nvenom. It calls my style dull and pompous. I think that will tell its\nown tale, placed after the other critiques.\"\n\n\"People's impressions are so different,\" said I. \"Some persons find 'Don\nQuixote' dull.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Vorticella, in emphatic chest tones, \"dulness is a matter of\nopinion; but pompous! That I never was and never could be. Perhaps he\nmeans that my matter is too important for his taste; and I have no\nobjection to _that_. I did not intend to be trivial. I should just like\nto read you that passage about the drag-nets, because I could make it\nclearer to you.\"\n\nA second (less ornamental) copy was at her elbow and was already opened,\nwhen to my great relief another guest was announced, and I was able to\ntake my leave without seeming to run away from 'The Channel Islands,'\nthough not without being compelled to carry with me the loan of \"the\nmarked copy,\" which I was to find advantageous in a re-perusal of the\nappendix, and was only requested to return before my departure from\nPumpiter. Looking into the volume now with some curiosity, I found it a\nvery ordinary combination of the commonplace and ambitious, one of those\nbooks which one might imagine to have been written under the old Grub\nStreet coercion of hunger and thirst, if they were not known beforehand\nto be the gratuitous productions of ladies and gentlemen whose\ncircumstances might be called altogether easy, but for an uneasy vanity\nthat happened to have been directed towards authorship. Its importance\nwas that of a polypus, tumour, fungus, or other erratic outgrowth,\nnoxious and disfiguring in its effect on the individual organism which\nnourishes it. Poor Vorticella might not have been more wearisome on a\nvisit than the majority of her neighbours, but for this disease of\nmagnified self-importance belonging to small authorship. I understand\nthat the chronic complaint of 'The Channel Islands' never left her. As\nthe years went on and the publication tended to vanish in the distance\nfor her neighbours' memory, she was still bent on dragging it to the\nforeground, and her chief interest in new acquaintances was the\npossibility of lending them her book, entering into all details\nconcerning it, and requesting them to read her album of \"critical\nopinions.\" This really made her more tiresome than Gregarina, whose\ndistinction was that she had had cholera, and who did not feel herself\nin her true position with strangers until they knew it.\n\nMy experience with Vorticella led me for a time into the false\nsupposition that this sort of fungous disfiguration, which makes Self\ndisagreeably larger, was most common to the female sex; but I presently\nfound that here too the male could assert his superiority and show a\nmore vigorous boredom. I have known a man with a single pamphlet\ncontaining an assurance that somebody else was wrong, together with a\nfew approved quotations, produce a more powerful effect of shuddering at\nhis approach than ever Vorticella did with her varied octavo volume,\nincluding notes and appendix. Males of more than one nation recur to my\nmemory who produced from their pocket on the slightest encouragement a\nsmall pink or buff duodecimo pamphlet, wrapped in silver paper, as a\npresent held ready for an intelligent reader. \"A mode of propagandism,\"\nyou remark in excuse; \"they wished to spread some useful corrective\ndoctrine.\" Not necessarily: the indoctrination aimed at was perhaps to\nconvince you of their own talents by the sample of an \"Ode on\nShakspere's Birthday,\" or a translation from Horace.\n\nVorticella may pair off with Monas, who had also written his one\nbook--'Here and There; or, a Trip from Truro to Transylvania'--and not\nonly carried it in his portmanteau when he went on visits, but took the\nearliest opportunity of depositing it in the drawing-room, and\nafterwards would enter to look for it, as if under pressure of a need\nfor reference, begging the lady of the house to tell him whether she,\nhad seen \"a small volume bound in red.\" One hostess at last ordered it\nto be carried into his bedroom to save his time; but it presently\nreappeared in his hands, and was again left with inserted slips of paper\non the drawing-room table.\n\nDepend upon it, vanity is human, native alike to men and women; only in\nthe male it is of denser texture, less volatile, so that it less\nimmediately informs you of its presence, but is more massive and capable\nof knocking you down if you come into collision with it; while in women\nvanity lays by its small revenges as in a needle-case always at hand.\nThe difference is in muscle and finger-tips, in traditional habits and\nmental perspective, rather than in the original appetite of vanity. It\nis an approved method now to explain ourselves by a reference to the\nraces as little like us as possible, which leads me to observe that in\nFiji the men use the most elaborate hair-dressing, and that wherever\ntattooing is in vogue the male expects to carry off the prize of\nadmiration for pattern and workmanship. Arguing analogically, and\nlooking for this tendency of the Fijian or Hawaian male in the eminent\nEuropean, we must suppose that it exhibits itself under the forms of\ncivilised apparel; and it would be a great mistake to estimate\npassionate effort by the effect it produces on our perception or\nunderstanding. It is conceivable that a man may have concentrated no\nless will and expectation on his wristbands, gaiters, and the shape of\nhis hat-brim, or an appearance which impresses you as that of the modern\n\"swell,\" than the Ojibbeway on an ornamentation which seems to us much\nmore elaborate. In what concerns the search for admiration at least, it\nis not true that the effect is equal to the cause and resembles it. The\ncause of a flat curl on the masculine forehead, such as might be seen\nwhen George the Fourth was king, must have been widely different in\nquality and intensity from the impression made by that small scroll of\nhair on the organ of the beholder. Merely to maintain an attitude and\ngait which I notice in certain club men, and especially an inflation of\nthe chest accompanying very small remarks, there goes, I am convinced,\nan expenditure of psychical energy little appreciated by the\nmultitude--a mental vision of Self and deeply impressed beholders which\nis quite without antitype in what we call the effect produced by that\nhidden process.\n\nNo! there is no need to admit that women would carry away the prize of\nvanity in a competition where differences of custom were fairly\nconsidered. A man cannot show his vanity in a tight skirt which forces\nhim to walk sideways down the staircase; but let the match be between\nthe respective vanities of largest beard and tightest skirt, and here\ntoo the battle would be to the strong.\n\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\n\nMORAL SWINDLERS.\n\nIt is a familiar example of irony in the degradation of words that \"what\na man is worth\" has come to mean how much money he possesses; but there\nseems a deeper and more melancholy irony in the shrunken meaning that\npopular or polite speech assigns to \"morality\" and \"morals.\" The poor\npart these words are made to play recalls the fate of those pagan\ndivinities who, after being understood to rule the powers of the air and\nthe destinies of men, came down to the level of insignificant demons, or\nwere even made a farcical show for the amusement of the multitude.\n\nTalking to Melissa in a time of commercial trouble, I found her disposed\nto speak pathetically of the disgrace which had fallen on Sir Gavial\nMantrap, because of his conduct in relation to the Eocene Mines, and to\nother companies ingeniously devised by him for the punishment of\nignorance in people of small means: a disgrace by which the poor titled\ngentleman was actually reduced to live in comparative obscurity on his\nwife's settlement of one or two hundred thousand in the consols.\n\n\"Surely your pity is misapplied,\" said I, rather dubiously, for I like\nthe comfort of trusting that a correct moral judgment is the strong\npoint in woman (seeing that she has a majority of about a million in our\nislands), and I imagined that Melissa might have some unexpressed\ngrounds for her opinion. \"I should have thought you would rather be\nsorry for Mantrap's victims--the widows, spinsters, and hard-working\nfathers whom his unscrupulous haste to make himself rich has cheated of\nall their savings, while he is eating well, lying softly, and after\nimpudently justifying himself before the public, is perhaps joining in\nthe General Confession with a sense that he is an acceptable object in\nthe sight of God, though decent men refuse to meet him.\"\n\n\"Oh, all that about the Companies, I know, was most unfortunate. In\ncommerce people are led to do so many things, and he might not know\nexactly how everything would turn out. But Sir Gavial made a good use of\nhis money, and he is a thoroughly _moral_ man.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by a thoroughly moral man?\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, I suppose every one means the same by that,\" said Melissa, with a\nslight air of rebuke. \"Sir Gavial is an excellent family man--quite\nblameless there; and so charitable round his place at Tiptop. Very\ndifferent from Mr Barabbas, whose life, my husband tells me, is most\nobjectionable, with actresses and that sort of thing. I think a man's\nmorals should make a difference to us. I'm not sorry for Mr Barabbas,\nbut _I am_ sorry for Sir Gavial Mantrap.\"\n\nI will not repeat my answer to Melissa, for I fear it was offensively\nbrusque, my opinion being that Sir Gavial was the more pernicious\nscoundrel of the two, since his name for virtue served as an effective\npart of a swindling apparatus; and perhaps I hinted that to call such a\nman moral showed rather a silly notion of human affairs. In fact, I had\nan angry wish to be instructive, and Melissa, as will sometimes happen,\nnoticed my anger without appropriating my instruction, for I have since\nheard that she speaks of me as rather violent-tempered, and not over\nstrict in my views of morality.\n\nI wish that this narrow use of words which are wanted in their full\nmeaning were confined to women like Melissa. Seeing that Morality and\nMorals under their _alias_ of Ethics are the subject of voluminous\ndiscussion, and their true basis a pressing matter of dispute--seeing\nthat the most famous book ever written on Ethics, and forming a chief\nstudy in our colleges, allies ethical with political science or that\nwhich treats of the constitution and prosperity of States, one might\nexpect that educated men would find reason to avoid a perversion of\nlanguage which lends itself to no wider view of life than that of\nvillage gossips. Yet I find even respectable historians of our own and\nof foreign countries, after showing that a king was treacherous,\nrapacious, and ready to sanction gross breaches in the administration of\njustice, end by praising him for his pure moral character, by which one\nmust suppose them to mean that he was not lewd nor debauched, not the\nEuropean twin of the typical Indian potentate whom Macaulay describes as\npassing his life in chewing bang and fondling dancing-girls. And since\nwe are sometimes told of such maleficent kings that they were religious,\nwe arrive at the curious result that the most serious wide-reaching\nduties of man lie quite outside both Morality and Religion--the one of\nthese consisting in not keeping mistresses (and perhaps not drinking too\nmuch), and the other in certain ritual and spiritual transactions with\nGod which can be carried on equally well side by side with the basest\nconduct towards men. With such a classification as this it is no wonder,\nconsidering the strong reaction of language on thought, that many minds,\ndizzy with indigestion of recent science and philosophy, are far to seek\nfor the grounds of social duty, and without entertaining any private\nintention of committing a perjury which would ruin an innocent man, or\nseeking gain by supplying bad preserved meats to our navy, feel\nthemselves speculatively obliged to inquire why they should not do so,\nand are inclined to measure their intellectual subtlety by their\ndissatisfaction with all answers to this \"Why?\" It is of little use to\ntheorise in ethics while our habitual phraseology stamps the larger part\nof our social duties as something that lies aloof from the deepest needs\nand affections of our nature. The informal definitions of popular\nlanguage are the only medium through which theory really affects the\nmass of minds even among the nominally educated; and when a man whose\nbusiness hours, the solid part of every day, are spent in an\nunscrupulous course of public or private action which has every\ncalculable chance of causing widespread injury and misery, can be called\nmoral because he comes home to dine with his wife and children and\ncherishes the happiness of his own hearth, the augury is not good for\nthe use of high ethical and theological disputation.\n\nNot for one moment would one willingly lose sight of the truth that the\nrelation of the sexes and the primary ties of kinship are the deepest\nroots of human wellbeing, but to make them by themselves the equivalent\nof morality is verbally to cut off the channels of feeling through\nwhich they are the feeders of that wellbeing. They are the original\nfountains of a sensibility to the claims of others, which is the bond of\nsocieties; but being necessarily in the first instance a private good,\nthere is always the danger that individual selfishness will see in them\nonly the best part of its own gain; just as knowledge, navigation,\ncommerce, and all the conditions which are of a nature to awaken men's\nconsciousness of their mutual dependence and to make the world one great\nsociety, are the occasions of selfish, unfair action, of war and\noppression, so long as the public conscience or chief force of feeling\nand opinion is not uniform and strong enough in its insistance on what\nis demanded by the general welfare. And among the influences that must\n<DW44> a right public judgment, the degradation of words which involve\npraise and blame will be reckoned worth protesting against by every\nmature observer. To rob words of half their meaning, while they retain\ntheir dignity as qualifications, is like allowing to men who have lost\nhalf their faculties the same high and perilous command which they won\nin their time of vigour; or like selling food and seeds after\nfraudulently abstracting their best virtues: in each case what ought to\nbe beneficently strong is fatally enfeebled, if not empoisoned. Until we\nhave altered our dictionaries and have found some other word than\n_morality_ to stand in popular use for the duties of man to man, let us\nrefuse to accept as moral the contractor who enriches himself by using\nlarge machinery to make pasteboard soles pass as leather for the feet of\nunhappy conscripts fighting at miserable odds against invaders: let us\nrather call him a miscreant, though he were the tenderest, most faithful\nof husbands, and contend that his own experience of home happiness makes\nhis reckless infliction of suffering on others all the more atrocious.\nLet us refuse to accept as moral any political leader who should allow\nhis conduct in relation to great issues to be determined by egoistic\npassion, and boldly say that he would be less immoral even though he\nwere as lax in his personal habits as Sir Robert Walpole, if at the same\ntime his sense of the public welfare were supreme in his mind, quelling\nall pettier impulses beneath a magnanimous impartiality. And though we\nwere to find among that class of journalists who live by recklessly\nreporting injurious rumours, insinuating the blackest motives in\nopponents, descanting at large and with an air of infallibility on\ndreams which they both find and interpret, and stimulating bad feeling\nbetween nations by abusive writing which is as empty of real conviction\nas the rage of a pantomime king, and would be ludicrous if its effects\ndid not make it appear diabolical--though we were to find among these a\nman who was benignancy itself in his own circle, a healer of private\ndifferences, a soother in private calamities, let us pronounce him\nnevertheless flagrantly immoral, a root of hideous cancer in the\ncommonwealth, turning the channels of instruction into feeders of social\nand political disease.\n\nIn opposite ways one sees bad effects likely to be encouraged by this\nnarrow use of the word _morals_, shutting out from its meaning half\nthose actions of a man's life which tell momentously on the wellbeing of\nhis fellow-citizens, and on the preparation of a future for the children\ngrowing up around him. Thoroughness of workmanship, care in the\nexecution of every task undertaken, as if it were the acceptance of a\ntrust which it would be a breach of faith not to discharge well, is a\nform of duty so momentous that if it were to die out from the feeling\nand practice of a people, all reforms of institutions would be helpless\nto create national prosperity and national happiness. Do we desire to\nsee public spirit penetrating all classes of the community and affecting\nevery man's conduct, so that he shall make neither the saving of his\nsoul nor any other private saving an excuse for indifference to the\ngeneral welfare? Well and good. But the sort of public spirit that\nscamps its bread-winning work, whether with the trowel, the pen, or the\noverseeing brain, that it may hurry to scenes of political or social\nagitation, would be as baleful a gift to our people as any malignant\ndemon could devise. One best part of educational training is that which\ncomes through special knowledge and manipulative or other skill, with\nits usual accompaniment of delight, in relation to work which is the\ndaily bread-winning occupation--which is a man's contribution to the\neffective wealth of society in return for what he takes as his own\nshare. But this duty of doing one's proper work well, and taking care\nthat every product of one's labour shall be genuinely what it pretends\nto be, is not only left out of morals in popular speech, it is very\nlittle insisted on by public teachers, at least in the only effective\nway--by tracing the continuous effects of ill-done work. Some of them\nseem to be still hopeful that it will follow as a necessary consequence\nfrom week-day services, ecclesiastical decoration, and improved\nhymn-books; others apparently trust to descanting on self-culture in\ngeneral, or to raising a general sense of faulty circumstances; and\nmeanwhile lax, make-shift work, from the high conspicuous kind to the\naverage and obscure, is allowed to pass unstamped with the disgrace of\nimmorality, though there is not a member of society who is not daily\nsuffering from it materially and spiritually, and though it is the fatal\ncause that must degrade our national rank and our commerce in spite of\nall open markets and discovery of available coal-seams.\n\nI suppose one may take the popular misuse of the words Morality and\nMorals as some excuse for certain absurdities which are occasional\nfashions in speech and writing--certain old lay-figures, as ugly as the\nqueerest Asiatic idol, which at different periods get propped into\nloftiness, and attired in magnificent Venetian drapery, so that whether\nthey have a human face or not is of little consequence. One is, the\nnotion that there is a radical, irreconcilable opposition between\nintellect and morality. I do not mean the simple statement of fact,\nwhich everybody knows, that remarkably able men have had very faulty\nmorals, and have outraged public feeling even at its ordinary standard;\nbut the supposition that the ablest intellect, the highest genius, will\nsee through morality as a sort of twaddle for bibs and tuckers, a\ndoctrine of dulness, a mere incident in human stupidity. We begin to\nunderstand the acceptance of this foolishness by considering that we\nlive in a society where we may hear a treacherous monarch, or a\nmalignant and lying politician, or a man who uses either official or\nliterary power as an instrument of his private partiality or hatred, or\na manufacturer who devises the falsification of wares, or a trader who\ndeals in virtueless seed-grains, praised or compassionated because of\nhis excellent morals.\n\nClearly if morality meant no more than such decencies as are practised\nby these poisonous members of society, it would be possible to say,\nwithout suspicion of light-headedness, that morality lay aloof from the\ngrand stream of human affairs, as a small channel fed by the stream and\nnot missed from it. While this form of nonsense is conveyed in the\npopular use of words, there must be plenty of well-dressed ignorance at\nleisure to run through a box of books, which will feel itself initiated\nin the freemasonry of intellect by a view of life which might take for a\nShaksperian motto--\n\n  \"Fair is foul and foul is fair,\n  Hover through the fog and filthy air\"--\n\nand will find itself easily provided with striking conversation by the\nrule of reversing all the judgments on good and evil which have come to\nbe the calendar and clock-work of society. But let our habitual talk\ngive morals their full meaning as the conduct which, in every human\nrelation, would follow from the fullest knowledge and the fullest\nsympathy--a meaning perpetually corrected and enriched by a more\nthorough appreciation of dependence in things, and a finer sensibility\nto both physical and spiritual fact--and this ridiculous ascription of\nsuperlative power to minds which have no effective awe-inspiring vision\nof the human lot, no response of understanding to the connection between\nduty and the material processes by which the world is kept habitable for\ncultivated man, will be tacitly discredited without any need to cite the\nimmortal names that all are obliged to take as the measure of\nintellectual rank and highly-charged genius.\n\nSuppose a Frenchman--I mean no disrespect to the great French nation,\nfor all nations are afflicted with their peculiar parasitic growths,\nwhich are lazy, hungry forms, usually characterised by a\ndisproportionate swallowing apparatus: suppose a Parisian who should\nshuffle down the Boulevard with a soul ignorant of the gravest cares and\nthe deepest tenderness of manhood, and a frame more or less fevered by\ndebauchery, mentally polishing into utmost refinement of phrase and\nrhythm verses which were an enlargement on that Shaksperian motto, and\nworthy of the most expensive title to be furnished by the vendors of\nsuch antithetic ware as _Les_ _marguerites de l'Enfer_, or _Les delices\nde Beelzebuth_. This supposed personage might probably enough regard his\nnegation of those moral sensibilities which make half the warp and woof\nof human history, his indifference to the hard thinking and hard\nhandiwork of life, to which he owed even his own gauzy mental garments\nwith their spangles of poor paradox, as the royalty of genius, for we\nare used to witness such self-crowning in many forms of mental\nalienation; but he would not, I think, be taken, even by his own\ngeneration, as a living proof that there can exist such a combination as\nthat of moral stupidity and trivial emphasis of personal indulgence with\nthe large yet finely discriminating vision which marks the intellectual\nmasters of our kind. Doubtless there are many sorts of transfiguration,\nand a man who has come to be worthy of all gratitude and reverence may\nhave had his swinish period, wallowing in ugly places; but suppose it\nhad been handed down to us that Sophocles or Virgil had at one time made\nhimself scandalous in this way: the works which have consecrated their\nmemory for our admiration and gratitude are not a glorifying of\nswinishness, but an artistic incorporation of the highest sentiment\nknown to their age.\n\nAll these may seem to be wide reasons for objecting to Melissa's pity\nfor Sir Gavial Mantrap on the ground of his good morals; but their\nconnection will not be obscure to any one who has taken pains to observe\nthe links uniting the scattered signs of our social development.\n\n\n\n\nXVII.\n\n\nSHADOWS OF THE COMING RACE.\n\nMy friend Trost, who is no optimist as to the state of the universe\nhitherto, but is confident that at some future period within the\nduration of the solar system, ours will be the best of all possible\nworlds--a hope which I always honour as a sign of beneficent\nqualities--my friend Trost always tries to keep up my spirits under the\nsight of the extremely unpleasant and disfiguring work by which many of\nour fellow-creatures have to get their bread, with the assurance that\n\"all this will soon be done by machinery.\" But he sometimes neutralises\nthe consolation by extending it over so large an area of human labour,\nand insisting so impressively on the quantity of energy which will thus\nbe set free for loftier purposes, that I am tempted to desire an\noccasional famine of invention in the coming ages, lest the humbler\nkinds of work should be entirely nullified while there are still left\nsome men and women who are not fit for the highest.\n\nEspecially, when one considers the perfunctory way in which some of the\nmost exalted tasks are already executed by those who are understood to\nbe educated for them, there rises a fearful vision of the human race\nevolving machinery which will by-and-by throw itself fatally out of\nwork. When, in the Bank of England, I see a wondrously delicate machine\nfor testing sovereigns, a shrewd implacable little steel Rhadamanthus\nthat, once the coins are delivered up to it, lifts and balances each in\nturn for the fraction of an instant, finds it wanting or sufficient, and\ndismisses it to right or left with rigorous justice; when I am told of\nmicrometers and thermopiles and tasimeters which deal physically with\nthe invisible, the impalpable, and the unimaginable; of cunning wires\nand wheels and pointing needles which will register your and my\nquickness so as to exclude flattering opinion; of a machine for drawing\nthe right conclusion, which will doubtless by-and-by be improved into\nan automaton for finding true premises; of a microphone which detects\nthe cadence of the fly's foot on the ceiling, and may be expected\npresently to discriminate the noises of our various follies as they\nsoliloquise or converse in our brains--my mind seeming too small for\nthese things, I get a little out of it, like an unfortunate savage too\nsuddenly brought face to face with civilisation, and I exclaim--\n\n\"Am I already in the shadow of the Coming Race? and will the creatures\nwho are to transcend and finally supersede us be steely organisms,\ngiving out the effluvia of the laboratory, and performing with\ninfallible exactness more than everything that we have performed with a\nslovenly approximativeness and self-defeating inaccuracy?\"\n\n\"But,\" says Trost, treating me with cautious mildness on hearing me vent\nthis raving notion, \"you forget that these wonder-workers are the slaves\nof our race, need our tendance and regulation, obey the mandates of our\nconsciousness, and are only deaf and dumb bringers of reports which we\ndecipher and make use of. They are simply extensions of the human\norganism, so to speak, limbs immeasurably more powerful, ever more\nsubtle finger-tips, ever more mastery over the invisibly great and the\ninvisibly small. Each new machine needs a new appliance of human skill\nto construct it, new devices to feed it with material, and often\nkeener-edged faculties to note its registrations or performances. How\nthen can machines supersede us?--they depend upon us. When we cease,\nthey cease.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said I, getting back into my mind, and\nbecoming rather wilful in consequence. \"If, as I have heard you contend,\nmachines as they are more and more perfected will require less and less\nof tendance, how do I know that they may not be ultimately made to\ncarry, or may not in themselves evolve, conditions of self-supply,\nself-repair, and reproduction, and not only do all the mighty and subtle\nwork possible on this planet better than we could do it, but with the\nimmense advantage of banishing from the earth's atmosphere screaming\nconsciousnesses which, in our comparatively clumsy race, make an\nintolerable noise and fuss to each other about every petty ant-like\nperformance, looking on at all work only as it were to spring a rattle\nhere or blow a trumpet there, with a ridiculous sense of being\neffective? I for my part cannot see any reason why a sufficiently\npenetrating thinker, who can see his way through a thousand years or so,\nshould not conceive a parliament of machines, in which the manners were\nexcellent and the motions infallible in logic: one honourable\ninstrument, a remote descendant of the Voltaic family, might discharge a\npowerful current (entirely without animosity) on an honourable\ninstrument opposite, of more upstart origin, but belonging to the\nancient edge-tool race which we already at Sheffield see paring thick\niron as if it were mellow cheese--by this unerringly directed discharge\noperating on movements corresponding to what we call Estimates, and by\nnecessary mechanical consequence on movements corresponding to what we\ncall the Funds, which with a vain analogy we sometimes speak of as\n\"sensitive.\" For every machine would be perfectly educated, that is to\nsay, would have the suitable molecular adjustments, which would act not\nthe less infallibly for being free from the fussy accompaniment of that\nconsciousness to which our prejudice gives a supreme governing rank,\nwhen in truth it is an idle parasite on the grand sequence of things.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort!\" returned Trost, getting angry, and judging it\nkind to treat me with some severity; \"what you have heard me say is,\nthat our race will and must act as a nervous centre to the utmost\ndevelopment of mechanical processes: the subtly refined powers of\nmachines will react in producing more subtly refined thinking processes\nwhich will occupy the minds set free from grosser labour. Say, for\nexample, that all the scavengers work of London were done, so far as\nhuman attention is concerned, by the occasional pressure of a brass\nbutton (as in the ringing of an electric bell), you will then have a\nmultitude of brains set free for the exquisite enjoyment of dealing with\nthe exact sequences and high speculations supplied and prompted by the\ndelicate machines which yield a response to the fixed stars, and give\nreadings of the spiral vortices fundamentally concerned in the\nproduction of epic poems or great judicial harangues. So far from\nmankind being thrown out of work according to your notion,\" concluded\nTrost, with a peculiar nasal note of scorn, \"if it were not for your\nincurable dilettanteism in science as in all other things--if you had\nonce understood the action of any delicate machine--you would perceive\nthat the sequences it carries throughout the realm of phenomena would\nrequire many generations, perhaps aeons, of understandings considerably\nstronger than yours, to exhaust the store of work it lays open.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said I, with a meekness which I felt was praiseworthy; \"it\nis the feebleness of my capacity, bringing me nearer than you to the\nhuman average, that perhaps enables me to imagine certain results better\nthan you can. Doubtless the very fishes of our rivers, gullible as they\nlook, and slow as they are to be rightly convinced in another order of\nfacts, form fewer false expectations about each other than we should\nform about them if we were in a position of somewhat fuller intercourse\nwith their species; for even as it is we have continually to be\nsurprised that they do not rise to our carefully selected bait. Take me\nthen as a sort of reflective and experienced carp; but do not estimate\nthe justice of my ideas by my facial expression.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" says Trost (We are on very intimate terms.)\n\n\"Naturally,\" I persisted, \"it is less easy to you than to me to imagine\nour race transcended and superseded, since the more energy a being is\npossessed of, the harder it must be for him to conceive his own death.\nBut I, from the point of view of a reflective carp, can easily imagine\nmyself and my congeners dispensed with in the frame of things and giving\nway not only to a superior but a vastly different kind of Entity. What I\nwould ask you is, to show me why, since each new invention casts a new\nlight along the pathway of discovery, and each new combination or\nstructure brings into play more conditions than its inventor foresaw,\nthere should not at length be a machine of such high mechanical and\nchemical powers that it would find and assimilate the material to supply\nits own waste, and then by a further evolution of internal molecular\nmovements reproduce itself by some process of fission or budding. This\nlast stage having been reached, either by man's contrivance or as an\nunforeseen result, one sees that the process of natural selection must\ndrive men altogether out of the field; for they will long before have\nbegun to sink into the miserable condition of those unhappy characters\nin fable who, having demons or djinns at their beck, and being obliged\nto supply them with work, found too much of everything done in too short\na time. What demons so potent as molecular movements, none the less\ntremendously potent for not carrying the futile cargo of a consciousness\nscreeching irrelevantly, like a fowl tied head downmost to the saddle of\na swift horseman? Under such uncomfortable circumstances our race will\nhave diminished with the diminishing call on their energies, and by the\ntime that the self-repairing and reproducing machines arise, all but a\nfew of the rare inventors, calculators, and speculators will have become\npale, pulpy, and cretinous from fatty or other degeneration, and behold\naround them a scanty hydrocephalous offspring. As to the breed of the\ningenious and intellectual, their nervous systems will at last have been\noverwrought in following the molecular revelations of the immensely\nmore powerful unconscious race, and they will naturally, as the less\nenergetic combinations of movement, subside like the flame of a candle\nin the sunlight Thus the feebler race, whose corporeal adjustments\nhappened to be accompanied with a maniacal consciousness which imagined\nitself moving its mover, will have vanished, as all less adapted\nexistences do before the fittest--i.e., the existence composed of the\nmost persistent groups of movements and the most capable of\nincorporating new groups in harmonious relation. Who--if our\nconsciousness is, as I have been given to understand, a mere stumbling\nof our organisms on their way to unconscious perfection--who shall say\nthat those fittest existences will not be found along the track of what\nwe call inorganic combinations, which will carry on the most elaborate\nprocesses as mutely and painlessly as we are now told that the minerals\nare metamorphosing themselves continually in the dark laboratory of the\nearth's crust? Thus this planet may be filled with beings who will be\nblind and deaf as the inmost rock, yet will execute changes as delicate\nand complicated as those of human language and all the intricate web of\nwhat we call its effects, without sensitive impression, without\nsensitive impulse: there may be, let us say, mute orations, mute\nrhapsodies, mute discussions, and no consciousness there even to enjoy\nthe silence.\"\n\n\"Absurd!\" grumbled Trost.\n\n\"The supposition is logical,\" said I. \"It is well argued from the\npremises.\"\n\n\"Whose premises?\" cried Trost, turning on me with some fierceness. \"You\ndon't mean to call them mine, I hope.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid! They seem to be flying about in the air with other\ngerms, and have found a sort of nidus among my melancholy fancies.\nNobody really holds them. They bear the same relation to real belief as\nwalking on the head for a show does to running away from an explosion or\nwalking fast to catch the train.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n\nTHE MODERN HEP! HEP! HEP!\n\nTo discern likeness amidst diversity, it is well known, does not require\nso fine a mental edge as the discerning of diversity amidst general\nsameness. The primary rough classification depends on the prominent\nresemblances of things: the progress is towards finer and finer\ndiscrimination according to minute differences. Yet even at this stage\nof European culture one's attention is continually drawn to the\nprevalence of that grosser mental sloth which makes people dull to the\nmost ordinary prompting of comparison--the bringing things together\nbecause of their likeness. The same motives, the same ideas, the same\npractices, are alternately admired and abhorred, lauded and denounced,\naccording to their association with superficial differences, historical\nor actually social: even learned writers treating of great subjects\noften show an attitude of mind not greatly superior in its logic to that\nof the frivolous fine lady who is indignant at the frivolity of her\nmaid.\n\nTo take only the subject of the Jews: it would be difficult to find a\nform of bad reasoning about them which has not been heard in\nconversation or been admitted to the dignity of print; but the neglect\nof resemblances is a common property of dulness which unites all the\nvarious points of view--the prejudiced, the puerile, the spiteful, and\nthe abysmally ignorant.\n\nThat the preservation of national memories is an element and a means of\nnational greatness, that their revival is a sign of reviving\nnationality, that every heroic defender, every patriotic restorer, has\nbeen inspired by such memories and has made them his watchword, that\neven such a corporate existence as that of a Roman legion or an English\nregiment has been made valorous by memorial standards,--these are the\nglorious commonplaces of historic teaching at our public schools and\nuniversities, being happily ingrained in Greek and Latin classics. They\nhave also been impressed on the world by conspicuous modern instances.\nThat there is a free modern Greece is due--through all infiltration of\nother than Greek blood--to the presence of ancient Greece in the\nconsciousness of European men; and every speaker would feel his point\nsafe if he were to praise Byron's devotion to a cause made glorious by\nideal identification with the past; hardly so, if he were to insist that\nthe Greeks were not to be helped further because their history shows\nthat they were anciently unsurpassed in treachery and lying, and that\nmany modern Greeks are highly disreputable characters, while others are\ndisposed to grasp too large a share of our commerce. The same with\nItaly: the pathos of his country's lot pierced the youthful soul of\nMazzini, because, like Dante's, his blood was fraught with the kinship\nof Italian greatness, his imagination filled with a majestic past that\nwrought itself into a majestic future. Half a century ago, what was\nItaly? An idling-place of dilettanteism or of itinerant motiveless\nwealth, a territory parcelled out for papal sustenance, dynastic\nconvenience, and the profit of an alien Government. What were the\nItalians? No people, no voice in European counsels, no massive power in\nEuropean affairs: a race thought of in English and French society as\nchiefly adapted to the operatic stage, or to serve as models for\npainters; disposed to smile gratefully at the reception of halfpence;\nand by the more historical remembered to be rather polite than truthful,\nin all probability a combination of Machiavelli, Rubini, and Masaniello.\nThanks chiefly to the divine gift of a memory which inspires the moments\nwith a past, a present, and a future, and gives the sense of corporate\nexistence that raises man above the otherwise more respectable and\ninnocent brute, all that, or most of it, is changed.\n\nAgain, one of our living historians finds just sympathy in his vigorous\ninsistance on our true ancestry, on our being the strongly marked\nheritors in language and genius of those old English seamen who,\nbeholding a rich country with a most convenient seaboard, came,\ndoubtless with a sense of divine warrant, and settled themselves on this\nor the other side of fertilising streams, gradually conquering more and\nmore of the pleasant land from the natives who knew nothing of Odin,\nand finally making unusually clean work in ridding themselves of those\nprior occupants. \"Let us,\" he virtually says, \"let us know who were our\nforefathers, who it was that won the soil for us, and brought the good\nseed of those institutions through which we should not arrogantly but\ngratefully feel ourselves distinguished among the nations as possessors\nof long-inherited freedom; let us not keep up an ignorant kind of naming\nwhich disguises our true affinities of blood and language, but let us\nsee thoroughly what sort of notions and traditions our forefathers had,\nand what sort of song inspired them. Let the poetic fragments which\nbreathe forth their fierce bravery in battle and their trust in fierce\ngods who helped them, be treasured with affectionate reverence. These\nseafaring, invading, self-asserting men were the English of old time,\nand were our fathers who did rough work by which we are profiting. They\nhad virtues which incorporated themselves in wholesome usages to which\nwe trace our own political blessings. Let us know and acknowledge our\ncommon relationship to them, and be thankful that over and above the\naffections and duties which spring from our manhood, we have the closer\nand more constantly guiding duties which belong to us as Englishmen.\"\n\nTo this view of our nationality most persons who have feeling and\nunderstanding enough to be conscious of the connection between the\npatriotic affection and every other affection which lifts us above\nemigrating rats and free-loving baboons, will be disposed to say Amen.\nTrue, we are not indebted to those ancestors for our religion: we are\nrather proud of having got that illumination from elsewhere. The men who\nplanted our nation were not Christians, though they began their work\ncenturies after Christ; and they had a decided objection to Christianity\nwhen it was first proposed to them: they were not monotheists, and their\nreligion was the reverse of spiritual. But since we have been fortunate\nenough to keep the island-home they won for us, and have been on the\nwhole a prosperous people, rather continuing the plan of invading and\nspoiling other lands than being forced to beg for shelter in them,\nnobody has reproached us because our fathers thirteen hundred years ago\nworshipped Odin, massacred Britons, and were with difficulty persuaded\nto accept Christianity, knowing nothing of Hebrew history and the\nreasons why Christ should be received as the Saviour of mankind. The Red\nIndians, not liking us when we settled among them, might have been\nwilling to fling such facts in our faces, but they were too ignorant,\nand besides, their opinions did not signify, because we were able, if we\nliked, to exterminate them. The Hindoos also have doubtless had their\nrancours against us and still entertain enough ill-will to make\nunfavourable remarks on our character, especially as to our historic\nrapacity and arrogant notions of our own superiority; they perhaps do\nnot admire the usual English profile, and they are not converted to our\nway of feeding: but though we are a small number of an alien race\nprofiting by the territory and produce of these prejudiced people, they\nare unable to turn us out; at least, when they tried we showed them\ntheir mistake. We do not call ourselves a dispersed and a punished\npeople: we are a colonising people, and it is we who have punished\nothers.\n\nStill the historian guides us rightly in urging us to dwell on the\nvirtues of our ancestors with emulation, and to cherish our sense of a\ncommon descent as a bond of obligation. The eminence, the nobleness of a\npeople depends on its capability of being stirred by memories, and of\nstriving for what we call spiritual ends--ends which consist not in\nimmediate material possession, but in the satisfaction of a great\nfeeling that animates the collective body as with one soul. A people\nhaving the seed of worthiness in it must feel an answering thrill when\nit is adjured by the deaths of its heroes who died to preserve its\nnational existence; when it is reminded of its small beginnings and\ngradual growth through past labours and struggles, such as are still\ndemanded of it in order that the freedom and wellbeing thus inherited\nmay be transmitted unimpaired to children and children's children; when\nan appeal against the permission of injustice is made to great\nprecedents in its history and to the better genius breathing in its\ninstitutions. It is this living force of sentiment in common which makes\na national consciousness. Nations so moved will resist conquest with\nthe very breasts of their women, will pay their millions and their blood\nto abolish slavery, will share privation in famine and all calamity,\nwill produce poets to sing \"some great story of a man,\" and thinkers\nwhose theories will bear the test of action. An individual man, to be\nharmoniously great, must belong to a nation of this order, if not in\nactual existence yet existing in the past, in memory, as a departed,\ninvisible, beloved ideal, once a reality, and perhaps to be restored. A\ncommon humanity is not yet enough to feed the rich blood of various\nactivity which makes a complete man. The time is not come for\ncosmopolitanism to be highly virtuous, any more than for communism to\nsuffice for social energy. I am not bound to feel for a Chinaman as I\nfeel for my fellow-countryman: I am bound not to demoralise him with\nopium, not to compel him to my will by destroying or plundering the\nfruits of his labour on the alleged ground that he is not cosmopolitan\nenough, and not to insult him for his want of my tailoring and religion\nwhen he appears as a peaceable visitor on the London pavement. It is\nadmirable in a Briton with a good purpose to learn Chinese, but it\nwould not be a proof of fine intellect in him to taste Chinese poetry in\nthe original more than he tastes the poetry of his own tongue.\nAffection, intelligence, duty, radiate from a centre, and nature has\ndecided that for us English folk that centre can be neither China nor\nPeru. Most of us feel this unreflectingly; for the affectation of\nundervaluing everything native, and being too fine for one's own\ncountry, belongs only to a few minds of no dangerous leverage. What is\nwanting is, that we should recognise a corresponding attachment to\nnationality as legitimate in every other people, and understand that its\nabsence is a privation of the greatest good.\n\nFor, to repeat, not only the nobleness of a nation depends on the\npresence of this national consciousness, but also the nobleness of each\nindividual citizen. Our dignity and rectitude are proportioned to our\nsense of relationship with something great, admirable, pregnant with\nhigh possibilities, worthy of sacrifice, a continual inspiration to\nself-repression and discipline by the presentation of aims larger and\nmore attractive to our generous part than the securing of personal ease\nor prosperity. And a people possessing this good should surely feel not\nonly a ready sympathy with the effort of those who, having lost the\ngood, strive to regain it, but a profound pity for any degradation\nresulting from its loss; nay, something more than pity when happier\nnationalities have made victims of the unfortunate whose memories\nnevertheless are the very fountain to which the persecutors trace their\nmost vaunted blessings.\n\nThese notions are familiar: few will deny them in the abstract, and many\nare found loudly asserting them in relation to this or the other\nparticular case. But here as elsewhere, in the ardent application of\nideas, there is a notable lack of simple comparison or sensibility to\nresemblance. The European world has long been used to consider the Jews\nas altogether exceptional, and it has followed naturally enough that\nthey have been excepted from the rules of justice and mercy, which are\nbased on human likeness. But to consider a people whose ideas have\ndetermined the religion of half the world, and that the more cultivated\nhalf, and who made the most eminent struggle against the power of Rome,\nas a purely exceptional race, is a demoralising offence against rational\nknowledge, a stultifying inconsistency in historical interpretation.\nEvery nation of forcible character--i.e., of strongly marked\ncharacteristics, is so far exceptional. The distinctive note of each\nbird-species is in this sense exceptional, but the necessary ground of\nsuch distinction is a deeper likeness. The superlative peculiarity in\nthe Jews admitted, our affinity with them is only the more apparent when\nthe elements of their peculiarity are discerned.\n\nFrom whatever point of view the writings of the Old Testament may be\nregarded, the picture they present of a national development is of high\ninterest and speciality, nor can their historic momentousness be much\naffected by any varieties of theory as to the relation they bear to the\nNew Testament or to the rise and constitution of Christianity. Whether\nwe accept the canonical Hebrew books as a revelation or simply as part\nof an ancient literature, makes no difference to the fact that we find\nthere the strongly characterised portraiture of a people educated from\nan earlier or later period to a sense of separateness unique in its\nintensity, a people taught by many concurrent influences to identify\nfaithfulness to its national traditions with the highest social and\nreligious blessings. Our too scanty sources of Jewish history, from the\nreturn under Ezra to the beginning of the desperate resistance against\nRome, show us the heroic and triumphant struggle of the Maccabees, which\nrescued the religion and independence of the nation from the corrupting\nsway of the Syrian Greeks, adding to the glorious sum of its memorials,\nand stimulating continuous efforts of a more peaceful sort to maintain\nand develop that national life which the heroes had fought and died for,\nby internal measures of legal administration and public teaching.\nThenceforth the virtuous elements of the Jewish life were engaged, as\nthey had been with varying aspects during the long and changeful\nprophetic period and the restoration under Ezra, on the side of\npreserving the specific national character against a demoralising fusion\nwith that of foreigners whose religion and ritual were idolatrous and\noften obscene. There was always a Foreign party reviling the National\nparty as narrow, and sometimes manifesting their own breadth in\nextensive views of advancement or profit to themselves by flattery of a\nforeign power. Such internal conflict naturally tightened the bands of\nconservatism, which needed to be strong if it were to rescue the sacred\nark, the vital spirit of a small nation--\"the smallest of the\nnations\"--whose territory lay on the highway between three continents;\nand when the dread and hatred of foreign sway had condensed itself into\ndread and hatred of the Romans, many Conservatives became Zealots, whose\nchief mark was that they advocated resistance to the death against the\nsubmergence of their nationality. Much might be said on this point\ntowards distinguishing the desperate struggle against a conquest which\nis regarded as degradation and corruption, from rash, hopeless\ninsurrection against an established native government; and for my part\n(if that were of any consequence) I share the spirit of the Zealots. I\ntake the spectacle of the Jewish people defying the Roman edict, and\npreferring death by starvation or the sword to the introduction of\nCaligula's deified statue into the temple, as a sublime type of\nsteadfastness. But all that need be noticed here is the continuity of\nthat national education (by outward and inward circumstance) which\ncreated in the Jews a feeling of race, a sense of corporate existence,\nunique in its intensity.\n\nBut not, before the dispersion, unique in essential qualities. There is\nmore likeness than contrast between the way we English got our island\nand the way the Israelites got Canaan. We have not been noted for\nforming a low estimate of ourselves in comparison with foreigners, or\nfor admitting that our institutions are equalled by those of any other\npeople under the sun. Many of us have thought that our sea-wall is a\nspecially divine arrangement to make and keep us a nation of sea-kings\nafter the manner of our forefathers, secure against invasion and able to\ninvade other lands when we need them, though they may lie on the other\nside of the ocean. Again, it has been held that we have a peculiar\ndestiny as a Protestant people, not only able to bruise the head of an\nidolatrous Christianity in the midst of us, but fitted as possessors of\nthe most truth and the most tonnage to carry our purer religion over the\nworld and convert mankind to our way of thinking. The Puritans,\nasserting their liberty to restrain tyrants, found the Hebrew history\nclosely symbolical of their feelings and purpose; and it can hardly be\ncorrect to cast the blame of their less laudable doings on the writings\nthey invoked, since their opponents made use of the same writings for\ndifferent ends, finding there a strong warrant for the divine right of\nkings and the denunciation of those who, like Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,\ntook on themselves the office of the priesthood which belonged of right\nsolely to Aaron and his sons, or, in other words, to men ordained by the\nEnglish bishops. We must rather refer the passionate use of the Hebrew\nwritings to affinities of disposition between our own race and the\nJewish. Is it true that the arrogance of a Jew was so immeasurably\nbeyond that of a Calvinist? And the just sympathy and admiration which\nwe give to the ancestors who resisted the oppressive acts of our native\nkings, and by resisting rescued or won for us the best part of our civil\nand religious liberties--is it justly to be withheld from those brave\nand steadfast men of Jewish race who fought and died, or strove by wise\nadministration to resist, the oppression and corrupting influences of\nforeign tyrants, and by resisting rescued the nationality which was the\nvery hearth of our own religion? At any rate, seeing that the Jews were\nmore specifically than any other nation educated into a sense of their\nsupreme moral value, the chief matter of surprise is that any other\nnation is found to rival them in this form of self-confidence.\n\nMore exceptional--less like the course of our own history--has been\ntheir dispersion and their subsistence as a separate people through ages\nin which for the most part they were regarded and treated very much as\nbeasts hunted for the sake of their skins, or of a valuable secretion\npeculiar to their species. The Jews showed a talent for accumulating\nwhat was an object of more immediate desire to Christians than animal\noils or well-furred skins, and their cupidity and avarice were found at\nonce particularly hateful and particularly useful: hateful when seen as\na reason for punishing them by mulcting or robbery, useful when this\nretributive process could be successfully carried forward. Kings and\nemperors naturally were more alive to the usefulness of subjects who\ncould gather and yield money; but edicts issued to protect \"the King's\nJews\" equally with the King's game from being harassed and hunted by the\ncommonalty were only slight mitigations to the deplorable lot of a race\nheld to be under the divine curse, and had little force after the\nCrusades began. As the slave-holders in the United States counted the\ncurse on Ham a justification of <DW64> slavery, so the curse on the Jews\nwas counted a justification for hindering them from pursuing agriculture\nand handicrafts; for marking them out as execrable figures by a peculiar\ndress; for torturing them to make them part with their gains, or for\nmore gratuitously spitting at them and pelting them; for taking it as\ncertain that they killed and ate babies, poisoned the wells, and took\npains to spread the plague; for putting it to them whether they would be\nbaptised or burned, and not failing to burn and massacre them when they\nwere obstinate; but also for suspecting them of disliking the baptism\nwhen they had got it, and then burning them in punishment of their\ninsincerity; finally, for hounding them by tens on tens of thousands\nfrom the homes where they had found shelter for centuries, and\ninflicting on them the horrors of a new exile and a new dispersion. All\nthis to avenge the Saviour of mankind, or else to compel these\nstiff-necked people to acknowledge a Master whose servants showed such\nbeneficent effects of His teaching.\n\nWith a people so treated one of two issues was possible: either from\nbeing of feebler nature than their persecutors, and caring more for ease\nthan for the sentiments and ideas which constituted their distinctive\ncharacter, they would everywhere give way to pressure and get rapidly\nmerged in the populations around them; or, being endowed with uncommon\ntenacity, physical and mental, feeling peculiarly the ties of\ninheritance both in blood and faith, remembering national glories,\ntrusting in their recovery, abhorring apostasy, able to bear all things\nand hope all things with the consciousness of being steadfast to\nspiritual obligations, the kernel of their number would harden into an\ninflexibility more and more insured by motive and habit. They would\ncherish all differences that marked them off from their hated\noppressors, all memories that consoled them with a sense of virtual\nthough unrecognised superiority; and the separateness which was made\ntheir badge of ignominy would be their inward pride, their source of\nfortifying defiance. Doubtless such a people would get confirmed in\nvices. An oppressive government and a persecuting religion, while\nbreeding vices in those who hold power, are well known to breed\nanswering vices in those who are powerless and suffering. What more\ndirect plan than the course presented by European history could have\nbeen pursued in order to give the Jews a spirit of bitter isolation, of\nscorn for the wolfish hypocrisy that made victims of them, of triumph in\nprospering at the expense of the blunderers who stoned them away from\nthe open paths of industry?--or, on the other hand, to encourage in the\nless defiant a lying conformity, a pretence of conversion for the sake\nof the social advantages attached to baptism, an outward renunciation of\ntheir hereditary ties with the lack of real love towards the society\nand creed which exacted this galling tribute?--or again, in the most\nunhappy specimens of the race, to rear transcendent examples of odious\nvice, reckless instruments of rich men with bad propensities,\nunscrupulous grinders of the alien people who wanted to grind _them_?\n\nNo wonder the Jews have their vices: no wonder if it were proved (which\nit has not hitherto appeared to be) that some of them have a bad\npre-eminence in evil, an unrivalled superfluity of naughtiness. It would\nbe more plausible to make a wonder of the virtues which have prospered\namong them under the shadow of oppression. But instead of dwelling on\nthese, or treating as admitted what any hardy or ignorant person may\ndeny, let us found simply on the loud assertions of the hostile. The\nJews, it is said, resisted the expansion of their own religion into\nChristianity; they were in the habit of spitting on the cross; they have\nheld the name of Christ to be _Anathema_. Who taught them that? The men\nwho made Christianity a curse to them: the men who made the name of\nChrist a symbol for the spirit of vengeance, and, what was worse, made\nthe execution of the vengeance a pretext for satisfying their own\nsavageness, greed, and envy: the men who sanctioned with the name of\nChrist a barbaric and blundering copy of pagan fatalism in taking the\nwords \"His blood be upon us and on our children\" as a divinely appointed\nverbal warrant for wreaking cruelty from generation to generation on the\npeople from whose sacred writings Christ drew His teaching. Strange\nretrogression in the professors of an expanded religion, boasting an\nillumination beyond the spiritual doctrine of Hebrew prophets! For\nHebrew prophets proclaimed a God who demanded mercy rather than\nsacrifices. The Christians also believed that God delighted not in the\nblood of rams and of bulls, but they apparently conceived Him as\nrequiring for His satisfaction the sighs and groans, the blood and\nroasted flesh of men whose forefathers had misunderstood the\nmetaphorical character of prophecies which spoke of spiritual\npre-eminence under the figure of a material kingdom. Was this the method\nby which Christ desired His title to the Messiahship to be commended to\nthe hearts and understandings of the nation in which He was born? Many\nof His sayings bear the stamp of that patriotism which places\nfellow-countrymen in the inner circle of affection and duty. And did the\nwords \"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do,\" refer only to\nthe centurion and his band, a tacit exception being made of every Hebrew\nthere present from the mercy of the Father and the compassion of the\nSon?--nay, more, of every Hebrew yet to come who remained unconverted\nafter hearing of His claim to the Messiahship, not from His own lips or\nthose of His native apostles, but from the lips of alien men whom cross,\ncreed, and baptism had left cruel, rapacious, and debauched? It is more\nreverent to Christ to believe that He must have approved the Jewish\nmartyrs who deliberately chose to be burned or massacred rather than be\nguilty of a blaspheming lie, more than He approved the rabble of\ncrusaders who robbed and murdered them in His name. But these\nremonstrances seem to have no direct application to personages who take\nup the attitude of philosophic thinkers and discriminating critics,\nprofessedly accepting Christianity from a rational point of view as a\nvehicle of the highest religious and moral truth, and condemning the\nJews on the ground that they are obstinate adherents of an outworn\ncreed, maintain themselves in moral alienation from the peoples with\nwhom they share citizenship, and are destitute of real interest in the\nwelfare of the community and state with which they are thus identified.\nThese anti-Judaic advocates usually belong to a party which has felt\nitself glorified in winning for Jews, as well as Dissenters and\nCatholics, the full privileges of citizenship, laying open to them every\npath to distinction. At one time the voice of this party urged that\ndifferences of creed were made dangerous only by the denial of\ncitizenship--that you must make a man a citizen before he could feel\nlike one. At present, apparently, this confidence has been succeeded by\na sense of mistake: there is a regret that no limiting clauses were\ninsisted on, such as would have hindered the Jews from coming too far\nand in too large proportion along those opened pathways; and the\nRoumanians are thought to have shown an enviable wisdom in giving them\nas little chance as possible. But then, the reflection occurring that\nsome of the most objectionable Jews are baptised Christians, it is\nobvious that such clauses would have been insufficient, and the doctrine\nthat you can turn a Jew into a good Christian is emphatically retracted.\nBut clearly, these liberal gentlemen, too late enlightened by\ndisagreeable events, must yield the palm of wise foresight to those who\nargued against them long ago; and it is a striking spectacle to witness\nminds so panting for advancement in some directions that they are ready\nto force it on an unwilling society, in this instance despairingly\nrecurring to mediaeval types of thinking--insisting that the Jews are\nmade viciously cosmopolitan by holding the world's money-bag, that for\nthem all national interests are resolved into the algebra of loans, that\nthey have suffered an inward degradation stamping them as morally\ninferior, and--\"serve them right,\" since they rejected Christianity. All\nwhich is mirrored in an analogy, namely, that of the Irish, also a\nservile race, who have rejected Protestantism though it has been\nrepeatedly urged on them by fire and sword and penal laws, and whose\nplace in the moral scale may be judged by our advertisements, where the\nclause, \"No Irish need apply,\" parallels the sentence which for many\npolite persons sums up the question of Judaism--\"I never _did_ like the\nJews.\"\n\nIt is certainly worth considering whether an expatriated, denationalised\nrace, used for ages to live among antipathetic populations, must not\ninevitably lack some conditions of nobleness. If they drop that\nseparateness which is made their reproach, they may be in danger of\nlapsing into a cosmopolitan indifference equivalent to cynicism, and of\nmissing that inward identification with the nationality immediately\naround them which might make some amends for their inherited privation.\nNo dispassionate observer can deny this danger. Why, our own countrymen\nwho take to living abroad without purpose or function to keep up their\nsense of fellowship in the affairs of their own land are rarely good\nspecimens of moral healthiness; still, the consciousness of having a\nnative country, the birthplace of common memories and habits of mind,\nexisting like a parental hearth quitted but beloved; the dignity of\nbeing included in a people which has a part in the comity of nations\nand the growing federation of the world; that sense of special belonging\nwhich is the root of human virtues, both public and private,--all these\nspiritual links may preserve migratory Englishmen from the worst\nconsequences of their voluntary dispersion. Unquestionably the Jews,\nhaving been more than any other race exposed to the adverse moral\ninfluences of alienism, must, both in individuals and in groups, have\nsuffered some corresponding moral degradation; but in fact they have\nescaped with less of abjectness and less of hard hostility towards the\nnations whose hand has been against them, than could have happened in\nthe case of a people who had neither their adhesion to a separate\nreligion founded on historic memories, nor their characteristic family\naffectionateness. Tortured, flogged, spit upon, the _corpus vile_ on\nwhich rage or wantonness vented themselves with impunity, their name\nflung at them as an opprobrium by superstition, hatred, and contempt,\nthey have remained proud of their origin. Does any one call this an evil\npride? Perhaps he belongs to that order of man who, while he has a\ndemocratic dislike to dukes and earls, wants to make believe that his\nfather was an idle gentleman, when in fact he was an honourable artisan,\nor who would feel flattered to be taken for other than an Englishman. It\nis possible to be too arrogant about our blood or our calling, but that\narrogance is virtue compared with such mean pretence. The pride which\nidentifies us with a great historic body is a humanising, elevating\nhabit of mind, inspiring sacrifices of individual comfort, gain, or\nother selfish ambition, for the sake of that ideal whole; and no man\nswayed by such a sentiment can become completely abject. That a Jew of\nSmyrna, where a whip is carried by passengers ready to flog off the too\nofficious specimens of his race, can still be proud to say, \"I am a\nJew,\" is surely a fact to awaken admiration in a mind capable of\nunderstanding what we may call the ideal forces in human history. And\nagain, a varied, impartial observation of the Jews in different\ncountries tends to the impression that they have a predominant\nkindliness which must have been deeply ingrained in the constitution of\ntheir race to have outlasted the ages of persecution and oppression.\nThe concentration of their joys in domestic life has kept up in them the\ncapacity of tenderness: the pity for the fatherless and the widow, the\ncare for the women and the little ones, blent intimately with their\nreligion, is a well of mercy that cannot long or widely be pent up by\nexclusiveness. And the kindliness of the Jew overflows the line of\ndivision between him and the Gentile. On the whole, one of the most\nremarkable phenomena in the history of this scattered people, made for\nages \"a scorn and a hissing\" is, that after being subjected to this\nprocess, which might have been expected to be in every sense\ndeteriorating and vitiating, they have come out of it (in any estimate\nwhich allows for numerical proportion) rivalling the nations of all\nEuropean countries in healthiness and beauty of _physique_, in practical\nability, in scientific and artistic aptitude, and in some forms of\nethical value. A significant indication of their natural rank is seen in\nthe fact that at this moment, the leader of the Liberal party in Germany\nis a Jew, the leader of the Republican party in France is a Jew, and the\nhead of the Conservative ministry in England is a Jew. And here it is\nthat we find the ground for the obvious jealousy which is now\nstimulating the revived expression of old antipathies. \"The Jews,\" it is\nfelt, \"have a dangerous tendency to get the uppermost places not only in\ncommerce but in political life. Their monetary hold on governments is\ntending to perpetuate in leading Jews a spirit of universal alienism\n(euphemistically called cosmopolitanism), even where the West has given\nthem a full share in civil and political rights. A people with oriental\nsunlight in their blood, yet capable of being everywhere acclimatised,\nthey have a force and toughness which enables them to carry off the best\nprizes; and their wealth is likely to put half the seats in Parliament\nat their disposal.\"\n\nThere is truth in these views of Jewish social and political relations.\nBut it is rather too late for liberal pleaders to urge them in a merely\nvituperative sense. Do they propose as a remedy for the impending danger\nof our healthier national influences getting overridden by Jewish\npredominance, that we should repeal our emancipatory laws? Not all the\nGermanic immigrants who have been settling among us for generations,\nand are still pouring in to settle, are Jews, but thoroughly Teutonic\nand more or less Christian craftsmen, mechanicians, or skilled and\nerudite functionaries; and the Semitic Christians who swarm among us are\ndangerously like their unconverted brethren in complexion, persistence,\nand wealth. Then there are the Greeks who, by the help of Phoenician\nblood or otherwise, are objectionably strong in the city. Some judges\nthink that the Scotch are more numerous and prosperous here in the South\nthan is quite for the good of us Southerners; and the early\ninconvenience felt under the Stuarts of being quartered upon by a\nhungry, hard-working people with a distinctive accent and form of\nreligion, and higher cheek-bones than English taste requires, has not\nyet been quite neutralised. As for the Irish, it is felt in high\nquarters that we have always been too lenient towards them;--at least,\nif they had been harried a little more there might not have been so many\nof them on the English press, of which they divide the power with the\nScotch, thus driving many Englishmen to honest and ineloquent labour.\n\nSo far shall we be carried if we go in search of devices to hinder\npeople of other blood than our own from getting the advantage of\ndwelling among us.\n\nLet it be admitted that it is a calamity to the English, as to any other\ngreat historic people, to undergo a premature fusion with immigrants of\nalien blood; that its distinctive national characteristics should be in\ndanger of obliteration by the predominating quality of foreign settlers.\nI not only admit this, I am ready to unite in groaning over the\nthreatened danger. To one who loves his native language, who would\ndelight to keep our rich and harmonious English undefiled by foreign\naccent, foreign intonation, and those foreign tinctures of verbal\nmeaning which tend to confuse all writing and discourse, it is an\naffliction as harassing as the climate, that on our stage, in our\nstudios, at our public and private gatherings, in our offices,\nwarehouses, and workshops, we must expect to hear our beloved English\nwith its words clipped, its vowels stretched and twisted, its phrases of\nacquiescence and politeness, of cordiality, dissidence or argument,\ndelivered always in the wrong tones, like ill-rendered melodies, marred\nbeyond recognition; that there should be a general ambition to speak\nevery language except our mother English, which persons \"of style\" are\nnot ashamed of corrupting with slang, false foreign equivalents, and a\npronunciation that crushes out all colour from the vowels and jams them\nbetween jostling consonants. An ancient Greek might not like to be\nresuscitated for the sake of hearing Homer read in our universities,\nstill he would at least find more instructive marvels in other\ndevelopments to be witnessed at those institutions; but a modern\nEnglishman is invited from his after-dinner repose to hear Shakspere\ndelivered under circumstances which offer no other novelty than some\nnovelty of false intonation, some new distribution of strong emphasis on\nprepositions, some new misconception of a familiar idiom. Well! it is\nour inertness that is in fault, our carelessness of excellence, our\nwilling ignorance of the treasures that lie in our national heritage,\nwhile we are agape after what is foreign, though it may be only a vile\nimitation of what is native.\n\nThis marring of our speech, however, is a minor evil compared with what\nmust follow from the predominance of wealth--acquiring immigrants, whose\nappreciation of our political and social life must often be as\napproximative or fatally erroneous as their delivery of our language.\nBut take the worst issues--what can we do to hinder them? Are we to\nadopt the exclusiveness for which we have punished the Chinese? Are we\nto tear the glorious flag of hospitality which has made our freedom the\nworld-wide blessing of the oppressed? It is not agreeable to find\nforeign accents and stumbling locutions passing from the piquant\nexception to the general rule of discourse. But to urge on that account\nthat we should spike away the peaceful foreigner, would be a view of\ninternational relations not in the long-run favourable to the interests\nof our fellow-countrymen; for we are at least equal to the races we call\nobtrusive in the disposition to settle wherever money is to be made and\ncheaply idle living to be found. In meeting the national evils which are\nbrought upon us by the onward course of the world, there is often no\nmore immediate hope or resource than that of striving after fuller\nnational excellence, which must consist in the moulding of more\nexcellent individual natives. The tendency of things is towards the\nquicker or slower fusion of races. It is impossible to arrest this\ntendency: all we can do is to moderate its course so as to hinder it\nfrom degrading the moral status of societies by a too rapid effacement\nof those national traditions and customs which are the language of the\nnational genius--the deep suckers of healthy sentiment. Such moderating\nand guidance of inevitable movement is worthy of all effort. And it is\nin this sense that the modern insistance on the idea of Nationalities\nhas value. That any people at once distinct and coherent enough to form\na state should be held in subjection by an alien antipathetic government\nhas been becoming more and more a ground of sympathetic indignation; and\nin virtue of this, at least one great State has been added to European\ncouncils. Nobody now complains of the result in this case, though\nfar-sighted persons see the need to limit analogy by discrimination. We\nhave to consider who are the stifled people and who the stiflers before\nwe can be sure of our ground.\n\nThe only point in this connection on which Englishmen are agreed is,\nthat England itself shall not be subject to foreign rule. The fiery\nresolve to resist invasion, though with an improvised array of\npitchforks, is felt to be virtuous, and to be worthy of a historic\npeople. Why? Because there is a national life in our veins. Because\nthere is something specifically English which we feel to be supremely\nworth striving for, worth dying for, rather than living to renounce it.\nBecause we too have our share--perhaps a principal share--in that spirit\nof separateness which has not yet done its work in the education of\nmankind, which has created the varying genius of nations, and, like the\nMuses, is the offspring of memory.\n\nHere, as everywhere else, the human task seems to be the discerning and\nadjustment of opposite claims. But the end can hardly be achieved by\nurging contradictory reproaches, and instead of labouring after\ndiscernment as a preliminary to intervention, letting our zeal burst\nforth according to a capricious selection, first determined accidentally\nand afterwards justified by personal predilection. Not only John Gilpin\nand his wife, or Edwin and Angelina, seem to be of opinion that their\npreference or dislike of Russians, Servians, or Greeks, consequent,\nperhaps, on hotel adventures, has something to do with the merits of the\nEastern Question; even in a higher range of intellect and enthusiasm we\nfind a distribution of sympathy or pity for sufferers of different blood\nor votaries of differing religions, strangely unaccountable on any other\nground than a fortuitous direction of study or trivial circumstances of\ntravel. With some even admirable persons, one is never quite sure of any\nparticular being included under a general term. A provincial physician,\nit is said, once ordering a lady patient not to eat salad, was asked\npleadingly by the affectionate husband whether she might eat lettuce, or\ncresses, or radishes. The physician had too rashly believed in the\ncomprehensiveness of the word \"salad,\" just as we, if not enlightened by\nexperience, might believe in the all-embracing breadth of \"sympathy with\nthe injured and oppressed.\" What mind can exhaust the grounds of\nexception which lie in each particular case? There is understood to be a\npeculiar odour from the <DW64> body, and we know that some persons, too\nrationalistic to feel bound by the curse on Ham, used to hint very\nstrongly that this odour determined the question on the side of <DW64>\nslavery.\n\nAnd this is the usual level of thinking in polite society concerning the\nJews. Apart from theological purposes, it seems to be held surprising\nthat anybody should take an interest in the history of a people whose\nliterature has furnished all our devotional language; and if any\nreference is made to their past or future destinies some hearer is sure\nto state as a relevant fact which may assist our judgment, that she, for\nher part, is not fond of them, having known a Mr Jacobson who was very\nunpleasant, or that he, for his part, thinks meanly of them as a race,\nthough on inquiry you find that he is so little acquainted with their\ncharacteristics that he is astonished to learn how many persons whom he\nhas blindly admired and applauded are Jews to the backbone. Again, men\nwho consider themselves in the very van of modern advancement, knowing\nhistory and the latest philosophies of history, indicate their\ncontemptuous surprise that any one should entertain the destiny of the\nJews as a worthy subject, by referring to Moloch and their own\nagreement with the theory that the religion of Jehovah was merely a\ntransformed Moloch-worship, while in the same breath they are glorifying\n\"civilisation\" as a transformed tribal existence of which some\nlineaments are traceable in grim marriage customs of the native\nAustralians. Are these erudite persons prepared to insist that the name\n\"Father\" should no longer have any sanctity for us, because in their\nview of likelihood our Aryan ancestors were mere improvers on a state of\nthings in which nobody knew his own father?\n\nFor less theoretic men, ambitious, to be regarded as practical\npoliticians, the value of the Hebrew race has been measured by their\nunfavourable opinion of a prime minister who is a Jew by lineage. But it\nis possible to form a very ugly opinion as to the scrupulousness of\nWalpole or of Chatham; and in any case I think Englishmen would refuse\nto accept the character and doings of those eighteenth century statesmen\nas the standard of value for the English people and the part they have\nto play in the fortunes of mankind.\n\nIf we are to consider the future of the Jews at all, it seems\nreasonable to take as a preliminary question: Are they destined to\ncomplete fusion with the peoples among whom they are dispersed, losing\nevery remnant of a distinctive consciousness as Jews; or, are there in\nthe breadth and intensity with which the feeling of separateness, or\nwhat we may call the organised memory of a national consciousness,\nactually exists in the world-wide Jewish communities--the seven millions\nscattered from east to west--and again, are there in the political\nrelations of the world, the conditions present or approaching for the\nrestoration of a Jewish state planted on the old ground as a centre of\nnational feeling, a source of dignifying protection, a special channel\nfor special energies which may contribute some added form of national\ngenius, and an added voice in the councils of the world?\n\nThey are among us everywhere: it is useless to say we are not fond of\nthem. Perhaps we are not fond of proletaries and their tendency to form\nUnions, but the world is not therefore to be rid of them. If we wish to\nfree ourselves from the inconveniences that we have to complain of,\nwhether in proletaries or in Jews, our best course is to encourage all\nmeans of improving these neighbours who elbow us in a thickening crowd,\nand of sending their incommodious energies into beneficent channels. Why\nare we so eager for the dignity of certain populations of whom perhaps\nwe have never seen a single specimen, and of whose history, legend, or\nliterature we have been contentedly ignorant for ages, while we sneer at\nthe notion of a renovated national dignity for the Jews, whose ways of\nthinking and whose very verbal forms are on our lips in every prayer\nwhich we end with an Amen? Some of us consider this question dismissed\nwhen they have said that the wealthiest Jews have no desire to forsake\ntheir European palaces, and go to live in Jerusalem. But in a return\nfrom exile, in the restoration of a people, the question is not whether\ncertain rich men will choose to remain behind, but whether there will be\nfound worthy men who will choose to lead the return. Plenty of\nprosperous Jews remained in Babylon when Ezra marshalled his band of\nforty thousand and began a new glorious epoch in the history of his\nrace, making the preparation for that epoch in the history of the world\nwhich has been held glorious enough to be dated from for evermore. The\nhinge of possibility is simply the existence of an adequate community of\nfeeling as well as widespread need in the Jewish race, and the hope that\namong its finer specimens there may arise some men of instruction and\nardent public spirit, some new Ezras, some modern Maccabees, who will\nknow how to use all favouring outward conditions, how to triumph by\nheroic example, over the indifference of their fellows and the scorn of\ntheir foes, and will steadfastly set their faces towards making their\npeople once more one among the nations.\n\nFormerly, evangelical orthodoxy was prone to dwell on the fulfilment of\nprophecy in the \"restoration of the Jews,\" Such interpretation of the\nprophets is less in vogue now. The dominant mode is to insist on a\nChristianity that disowns its origin, that is not a substantial growth\nhaving a genealogy, but is a vaporous reflex of modern notions. The\nChrist of Matthew had the heart of a Jew--\"Go ye first to the lost\nsheep of the house of Israel.\" The Apostle of the Gentiles had the heart\nof a Jew: \"For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my\nbrethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: who are Israelites; to whom\npertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the\ngiving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; whose are\nthe fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.\" Modern\napostles, extolling Christianity, are found using a different tone: they\nprefer the mediaeval cry translated into modern phrase. But the\nmediaeval cry too was in substance very ancient--more ancient than the\ndays of Augustus. Pagans in successive ages said, \"These people are\nunlike us, and refuse to be made like us: let us punish them.\" The Jews\nwere steadfast in their separateness, and through that separateness\nChristianity was born. A modern book on Liberty has maintained that from\nthe freedom of individual men to persist in idiosyncrasies the world may\nbe enriched. Why should we not apply this argument to the idiosyncrasy\nof a nation, and pause in our haste to hoot it down? There is still a\ngreat function for the steadfastness of the Jew: not that he should\nshut out the utmost illumination which knowledge can throw on his\nnational history, but that he should cherish the store of inheritance\nwhich that history has left him. Every Jew should be conscious that he\nis one of a multitude possessing common objects of piety in the immortal\nachievements and immortal sorrows of ancestors who have transmitted to\nthem a physical and mental type strong enough, eminent enough in\nfaculties, pregnant enough with peculiar promise, to constitute a new\nbeneficent individuality among the nations, and, by confuting the\ntraditions of scorn, nobly avenge the wrongs done to their Fathers.\n\nThere is a sense in which the worthy child of a nation that has brought\nforth illustrious prophets, high and unique among the poets of the\nworld, is bound by their visions.\n\nIs bound?\n\nYes, for the effective bond of human action is feeling, and the worthy\nchild of a people owning the triple name of Hebrew, Israelite, and Jew,\nfeels his kinship with the glories and the sorrows, the degradation and\nthe possible renovation of his national family.\n\nWill any one teach the nullification of this feeling and call his\ndoctrine a philosophy? He will teach a blinding superstition--the\nsuperstition that a theory of human wellbeing can be constructed in\ndisregard of the influences which have made us human.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Impressions of Theophrastus Such, by George Eliot\n\n*** "}, {"short_book_title": "Odd Craft Part 4: Bill's Lapse by W.W.

Jacobs\n\n\n\nBILL'S LAPSE\n\nStrength and good-nature--said the night-watchman, musingly, as he felt\nhis biceps--strength and good-nature always go together.  Sometimes you\nfind a strong man who is not good-natured, but then, as everybody he\ncomes in contack with is, it comes to the same thing.\n\nThe strongest and kindest-'earted man I ever come across was a man o' the\nname of Bill Burton, a ship-mate of Ginger Dick's.  For that matter 'e\nwas a shipmate o' Peter Russet's and old Sam Small's too.  Not over and\nabove tall; just about my height, his arms was like another man's legs\nfor size, and 'is chest and his back and shoulders might ha' been made\nfor a giant.  And with all that he'd got a soft blue eye like a gal's\n(blue's my favourite colour for gals' eyes), and a nice, soft, curly\nbrown beard.  He was an A.B., too, and that showed 'ow good-natured he\nwas, to pick up with firemen.\n\nHe got so fond of 'em that when they was all paid off from the _Ocean\nKing_ he asked to be allowed to join them in taking a room ashore.  It\npleased every-body, four coming cheaper than three, and Bill being that\ngood-tempered that 'e'd put up with anything, and when any of the three\nquarrelled he used to act the part of peacemaker.\n\n[Illustration: \"When any of the three quarrelled he used to act the part\nof peacemaker.\"]\n\nThe only thing about 'im that they didn't like was that 'e was a\nteetotaler.  He'd go into public-'ouses with 'em, but he wouldn't drink;\nleastways, that is to say, he wouldn't drink beer, and Ginger used to say\nthat it made 'im feel uncomfortable to see Bill put away a bottle o'\nlemonade every time they 'ad a drink.  One night arter 'e had 'ad\nseventeen bottles he could 'ardly got home, and Peter Russet, who knew a\nlot about pills and such-like, pointed out to 'im 'ow bad it was for his\nconstitushon.  He proved that the lemonade would eat away the coats o'\nBill's stomach, and that if 'e kept on 'e might drop down dead at any\nmoment.\n\nThat frightened Bill a bit, and the next night, instead of 'aving\nlemonade, 'e had five bottles o' stone ginger-beer, six of different\nkinds of teetotal beer, three of soda-water, and two cups of coffee.  I'm\nnot counting the drink he 'ad at the chemist's shop arterward, because he\ntook that as medicine, but he was so queer in 'is inside next morning\nthat 'e began to be afraid he'd 'ave to give up drink altogether.\n\nHe went without the next night, but 'e was such a generous man that 'e\nwould pay every fourth time, and there was no pleasure to the other chaps\nto see 'im pay and 'ave nothing out of it.  It spoilt their evening, and\nowing to 'aving only about 'arf wot they was accustomed to they all got\nup very disagreeable next morning.\n\n\"Why not take just a little beer, Bill?\" asks Ginger.\n\nBill 'ung his 'ead and looked a bit silly.  \"I'd rather not, mate,\" he\nses, at last.  \"I've been teetotal for eleven months now.\"\n\n\"Think of your 'ealth, Bill,\" ses Peter Russet; \"your 'ealth is more\nimportant than the pledge.  Wot made you take it?\"\n\nBill coughed.  \"I 'ad reasons,\" he ses, slowly.  \"A mate o' mine wished\nme to.\"\n\n\"He ought to ha' known better,\" ses Sam.  \"He 'ad 'is reasons,\" ses Bill.\n\n\"Well, all I can say is, Bill,\" ses Ginger, \"all I can say is, it's very\ndisobligin' of you.\"\n\n\"Disobligin'?\" ses Bill, with a start; \"don't say that, mate.\"\n\n\"I must say it,\" ses Ginger, speaking very firm.\n\n\"You needn't take a lot, Bill,\" ses Sam; \"nobody wants you to do that.\nJust drink in moderation, same as wot we do.\"\n\n\"It gets into my 'ead,\" ses Bill, at last.\n\n\"Well, and wot of it?\" ses Ginger; \"it gets into everybody's 'ead\noccasionally.  Why, one night old Sam 'ere went up behind a policeman and\ntickled 'im under the arms; didn't you, Sam?\"\n\n\"I did nothing o' the kind,\" ses Sam, firing up.\n\n\"Well, you was fined ten bob for it next morning, that's all I know,\" ses\nGinger.\n\n\"I was fined ten bob for punching 'im,\" ses old Sam, very wild.  \"I never\ntickled a policeman in my life.  I never thought o' such a thing.  I'd no\nmore tickle a policeman than I'd fly.  Anybody that ses I did is a liar.\nWhy should I?  Where does the sense come in?  Wot should I want to do it\nfor?\"\n\n\"All right, Sam,\" ses Ginger, sticking 'is fingers in 'is ears, \"you\ndidn't, then.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" ses Sam, \"and don't you forget it.  This ain't the fust\ntime you've told that lie about me.  I can take a joke with any man; but\nanybody that goes and ses I tickled--\"\n\n\"All right,\" ses Ginger and Peter Russet together.  \"You'll 'ave tickled\npoliceman on the brain if you ain't careful, Sam,\" ses Peter.\n\nOld Sam sat down growling, and Ginger Dick turned to Bill agin.  \"It gets\ninto everybody's 'ead at times,\" he ses, \"and where's the 'arm?  It's wot\nit was meant for.\"\n\nBill shook his 'ead, but when Ginger called 'im disobligin' agin he gave\nway and he broke the pledge that very evening with a pint o' six 'arf.\n\nGinger was surprised to see the way 'e took his liquor.  Arter three or\nfour pints he'd expected to see 'im turn a bit silly, or sing, or do\nsomething o' the kind, but Bill kept on as if 'e was drinking water.\n\n\"Think of the 'armless pleasure you've been losing all these months,\nBill,\" ses Ginger, smiling at him.\n\nBill said it wouldn't bear thinking of, and, the next place they came to\nhe said some rather 'ard things of the man who'd persuaded 'im to take\nthe pledge.  He 'ad two or three more there, and then they began to see\nthat it was beginning to have an effect on 'im.  The first one that\nnoticed it was Ginger Dick.  Bill 'ad just lit 'is pipe, and as he threw\nthe match down he ses: \"I don't like these 'ere safety matches,\" he ses.\n\n\"Don't you, Bill?\" ses Ginger.  \"I do, rather.\"\n\n\"Oh, you do, do you?\"  ses Bill, turning on 'im like lightning; \"well,\ntake that for contradictin',\" he ses, an' he gave Ginger a smack that\nnearly knocked his 'ead off.\n\nIt was so sudden that old Sam and Peter put their beer down and stared at\neach other as if they couldn't believe their eyes.  Then they stooped\ndown and helped pore Ginger on to 'is legs agin and began to brush 'im\ndown.\n\n\"Never mind about 'im, mates,\" ses Bill, looking at Ginger very wicked.\n\"P'r'aps he won't be so ready to give me 'is lip next time.  Let's come\nto another pub and enjoy ourselves.\"\n\nSam and Peter followed 'im out like lambs, 'ardly daring to look over\ntheir shoulder at Ginger, who was staggering arter them some distance\nbehind a 'olding a handerchief to 'is face.\n\n\"It's your turn to pay, Sam,\" ses Bill, when they'd got inside the next\nplace.  \"Wot's it to be?  Give it a name.\"\n\n\"Three 'arf pints o' four ale, miss,\" ses Sam, not because 'e was mean,\nbut because it wasn't 'is turn.  \"Three wot?\" ses Bill, turning on 'im.\n\n\"Three pots o' six ale, miss,\" ses Sam, in a hurry.\n\n\"That wasn't wot you said afore,\" ses Bill.  \"Take that,\" he ses, giving\npore old Sam a wipe in the mouth and knocking 'im over a stool; \"take\nthat for your sauce.\"\n\nPeter Russet stood staring at Sam and wondering wot Bill ud be like when\nhe'd 'ad a little more.  Sam picked hisself up arter a time and went\noutside to talk to Ginger about it, and then Bill put 'is arm round\nPeter's neck and began to cry a bit and say 'e was the only pal he'd got\nleft in the world.  It was very awkward for Peter, and more awkward still\nwhen the barman came up and told 'im to take Bill outside.\n\n\"Go on,\" he ses, \"out with 'im.\"\n\n\"He's all right,\" ses Peter, trembling; \"we's the truest-'arted gentleman\nin London.  Ain't you, Bill?\"\n\nBill said he was, and 'e asked the barman to go and hide 'is face because\nit reminded 'im of a little dog 'e had 'ad once wot 'ad died.\n\n\"You get outside afore you're hurt,\" ses the bar-man.\n\nBill punched at 'im over the bar, and not being able to reach 'im threw\nPeter's pot o' beer at 'im.  There was a fearful to-do then, and the\nlandlord jumped over the bar and stood in the doorway, whistling for the\npolice.  Bill struck out right and left, and the men in the bar went down\nlike skittles, Peter among them.  Then they got outside, and Bill, arter\ngiving the landlord a thump in the back wot nearly made him swallow the\nwhistle, jumped into a cab and pulled Peter Russet in arter 'im.\n\n[Illustration: \"Bill jumped into a cab and pulled Peter Russet in arter\n'im.\"]\n\n\"I'll talk to you by-and-by,\" he ses, as the cab drove off at a gallop;\n\"there ain't room in this cab.  You wait, my lad, that's all.  You just\nwait till we get out, and I'll knock you silly.\"\n\n\"Wot for, Bill?\"  ses Peter, staring.\n\n\"Don't you talk to me,\" roars Bill.  \"If I choose to knock you about\nthat's my business, ain't it?  Besides, you know very well.\"\n\nHe wouldn't let Peter say another word, but coming to a quiet place near\nthe docks he stopped the cab and pulling 'im out gave 'im such a dressing\ndown that Peter thought 'is last hour 'ad arrived.  He let 'im go at\nlast, and after first making him pay the cab-man took 'im along till they\ncame to a public-'ouse and made 'im pay for drinks.\n\nThey stayed there till nearly eleven o'clock, and then Bill set off home\n'olding the unfortunit Peter by the scruff o' the neck, and wondering out\nloud whether 'e ought to pay 'im a bit more or not.  Afore 'e could make\nup 'is mind, however, he turned sleepy, and, throwing 'imself down on the\nbed which was meant for the two of 'em, fell into a peaceful sleep.\n\nSam and Ginger Dick came in a little while arterward, both badly marked\nwhere Bill 'ad hit them, and sat talking to Peter in whispers as to wot\nwas to be done.  Ginger, who 'ad plenty of pluck, was for them all to set\non to 'im, but Sam wouldn't 'ear of it, and as for Peter he was so sore\nhe could 'ardly move.\n\nThey all turned in to the other bed at last, 'arf afraid to move for fear\nof disturbing Bill, and when they woke up in the morning and see 'im\nsitting up in 'is bed they lay as still as mice.\n\n\"Why, Ginger, old chap,\" ses Bill, with a 'earty smile, \"wot are you all\nthree in one bed for?\"  \"We was a bit cold,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"Cold?\"  ses Bill.  \"Wot, this weather?  We 'ad a bit of a spree last\nnight, old man, didn't we?  My throat's as dry as a cinder.\"\n\n\"It ain't my idea of a spree,\" ses Ginger, sitting up and looking at 'im.\n\n\"Good 'eavens, Ginger!\" ses Bill, starting back, \"wotever 'ave you been\na-doing to your face?  Have you been tumbling off of a 'bus?\"\n\nGinger couldn't answer; and Sam Small and Peter sat up in bed alongside\nof 'im, and Bill, getting as far back on 'is bed as he could, sat staring\nat their pore faces as if 'e was having a 'orrible dream.\n\n\"And there's Sam,\" he ses.  \"Where ever did you get that mouth, Sam?\"\n\n\"Same place as Ginger got 'is eye and pore Peter got 'is face,\" ses Sam,\ngrinding his teeth.\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me,\" ses Bill, in a sad voice--\"you don't mean to\ntell me that I did it?\"\n\n\"You know well enough,\" ses Ginger.\n\nBill looked at 'em, and 'is face got as long as a yard measure.\n\n\"I'd 'oped I'd growed out of it, mates,\" he ses, at last, \"but drink\nalways takes me like that.  I can't keep a pal.\"\n\n\"You surprise me,\" ses Ginger, sarcastic-like.  \"Don't talk like that,\nGinger,\" ses Bill, 'arf crying.\n\n\"It ain't my fault; it's my weakness.  Wot did I do it for?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" ses Ginger, \"but you won't get the chance of doing it\nagin, I'll tell you that much.\"\n\n\"I daresay I shall be better to-night, Ginger,\" ses Bill, very humble;\n\"it don't always take me that way.\n\n\"Well, we don't want you with us any more,\" ses old Sam, 'olding his 'ead\nvery high.\n\n\"You'll 'ave to go and get your beer by yourself, Bill,\" ses Peter\nRusset, feeling 'is bruises with the tips of 'is fingers.\n\n\"But then I should be worse,\" ses Bill.  \"I want cheerful company when\nI'm like that.  I should very likely come 'ome and 'arf kill you all in\nyour beds.  You don't 'arf know what I'm like.  Last night was nothing,\nelse I should 'ave remembered it.\"\n\n\"Cheerful company?\"  ses old Sam.  'Ow do you think company's going to be\ncheerful when you're carrying on like that, Bill?  Why don't you go away\nand leave us alone?\"\n\n\"Because I've got a 'art,\" ses Bill.  \"I can't chuck up pals in that\nfree-and-easy way.  Once I take a liking to anybody I'd do anything for\n'em, and I've never met three chaps I like better than wot I do you.\nThree nicer, straight-forrad, free-'anded mates I've never met afore.\"\n\n\"Why not take the pledge agin, Bill?\"  ses Peter Russet.\n\n\"No, mate,\" ses Bill, with a kind smile; \"it's just a weakness, and I\nmust try and grow out of it.  I'll tie a bit o' string round my little\nfinger to-night as a re-minder.\"\n\nHe got out of bed and began to wash 'is face, and Ginger Dick, who was\ndoing a bit o' thinking, gave a whisper to Sam and Peter Russet.\n\n\"All right, Bill, old man,\" he ses, getting out of bed and beginning to\nput his clothes on; \"but first of all we'll try and find out 'ow the\nlandlord is.\"\n\n\"Landlord?\" ses Bill, puffing and blowing in the basin.  \"Wot landlord?\"\n\n\"Why, the one you bashed,\" ses Ginger, with a wink at the other two.  \"He\n'adn't got 'is senses back when me and Sam came away.\"\n\nBill gave a groan and sat on the bed while 'e dried himself, and Ginger\ntold 'im 'ow he 'ad bent a quart pot on the landlord's 'ead, and 'ow the\nlandlord 'ad been carried upstairs and the doctor sent for.  He began to\ntremble all over, and when Ginger said he'd go out and see 'ow the land\nlay 'e could 'ardly thank 'im enough.\n\nHe stayed in the bedroom all day, with the blinds down, and wouldn't eat\nanything, and when Ginger looked in about eight o'clock to find out\nwhether he 'ad gone, he found 'im sitting on the bed clean shaved, and\n'is face cut about all over where the razor 'ad slipped.\n\nGinger was gone about two hours, and when 'e came back he looked so\nsolemn that old Sam asked 'im whether he 'ad seen a ghost.  Ginger didn't\nanswer 'im; he set down on the side o' the bed and sat thinking.\n\n\"I s'pose--I s'pose it's nice and fresh in the streets this morning?\"\nses Bill, at last, in a trembling voice.\n\nGinger started and looked at 'im.  \"I didn't notice, mate,\" he ses.  Then\n'e got up and patted Bill on the back, very gentle, and sat down again.\n\n[Illustration: \"Patted Bill on the back, very gentle.\"]\n\n\"Anything wrong, Ginger?\"  asks Peter Russet, staring at 'im.\n\n\"It's that landlord,\" ses Ginger; \"there's straw down in the road\noutside, and they say that he's dying.  Pore old Bill don't know 'is own\nstrength.  The best thing you can do, old pal, is to go as far away as\nyou can, at once.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wait a minnit if it was me,\" ses old Sam.\n\nBill groaned and hid 'is face in his 'ands, and then Peter Russet went\nand spoilt things by saying that the safest place for a murderer to 'ide\nin was London.  Bill gave a dreadful groan when 'e said murderer, but 'e\nup and agreed with Peter, and all Sam and Ginger Dick could do wouldn't\nmake 'im alter his mind.  He said that he would shave off 'is beard and\nmoustache, and when night came 'e would creep out and take a lodging\nsomewhere right the other end of London.\n\n\"It'll soon be dark,\" ses Ginger, \"and your own brother wouldn't know you\nnow, Bill.  Where d'you think of going?\"\n\nBill shook his 'ead.  \"Nobody must know that, mate,\" he ses.  \"I must go\ninto hiding for as long as I can--as long as my money lasts; I've only\ngot six pounds left.\"\n\n\"That'll last a long time if you're careful,\" ses Ginger.\n\n\"I want a lot more,\" ses Bill.  \"I want you to take this silver ring as a\nkeepsake, Ginger.  If I 'ad another six pounds or so I should feel much\nsafer.  'Ow much 'ave you got, Ginger?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" ses Ginger, shaking his 'ead.\n\n\"Lend it to me, mate,\" ses Bill, stretching out his 'and.  \"You can easy\nget another ship.  Ah, I wish I was you; I'd be as 'appy as 'appy if I\nhadn't got a penny.\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry, Bill,\" ses Ginger, trying to smile, \"but I've already\npromised to lend it to a man wot we met this evening.  A promise is a\npromise, else I'd lend it to you with pleasure.\"\n\n\"Would you let me be 'ung for the sake of a few pounds, Ginger?\"  ses\nBill, looking at 'im reproach-fully.  \"I'm a desprit man, Ginger, and I\nmust 'ave that money.\"\n\nAfore pore Ginger could move he suddenly clapped 'is hand over 'is mouth\nand flung 'im on the bed.  Ginger was like a child in 'is hands, although\nhe struggled like a madman, and in five minutes 'e was laying there with\na towel tied round his mouth and 'is arms and legs tied up with the cord\noff of Sam's chest.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, Ginger,\" ses Bill, as 'e took a little over eight pounds\nout of Ginger's pocket.  \"I'll pay you back one o' these days, if I can.\nIf you'd got a rope round your neck same as I 'ave you'd do the same as\nI've done.\"\n\nHe lifted up the bedclothes and put Ginger inside and tucked 'im up.\nGinger's face was red with passion and 'is eyes starting out of his 'ead.\n\n\"Eight and six is fifteen,\" ses Bill, and just then he 'eard somebody\ncoming up the stairs.  Ginger 'eard it, too, and as Peter Russet came\ninto the room 'e tried all 'e could to attract 'is attention by rolling\n'is 'ead from side to side.\n\n\"Why, 'as Ginger gone to bed?\" ses Peter.  \"Wot's up, Ginger?\"\n\n\"He's all right,\" ses Bill; \"just a bit of a 'eadache.\"\n\nPeter stood staring at the bed, and then 'e pulled the clothes off and\nsaw pore Ginger all tied up, and making awful eyes at 'im to undo him.\n\n\"I 'ad to do it, Peter,\" ses Bill.  \"I wanted some more money to escape\nwith, and 'e wouldn't lend it to me.  I 'aven't got as much as I want\nnow.  You just came in in the nick of time.  Another minute and you'd ha'\nmissed me.  'Ow much 'ave you got?\"\n\n\"Ah, I wish I could lend you some, Bill,\" ses Peter Russet, turning pale,\n\"but I've 'ad my pocket picked; that's wot I came back for, to get some\nfrom Ginger.\"\n\nBill didn't say a word.\n\n\"You see 'ow it is, Bill,\" ses Peter, edging back toward the door; \"three\nmen laid 'old of me and took every farthing I'd got.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't rob you, then,\" ses Bill, catching 'old of 'im.\n\"Whoever's money this is,\" he ses, pulling a handful out o' Peter's\npocket, \"it can't be yours.  Now, if you make another sound I'll knock\nyour 'ead off afore I tie you up.\"\n\n\"Don't tie me up, Bill,\" ses Peter, struggling.\n\n\"I can't trust you,\" ses Bill, dragging 'im over to the washstand and\ntaking up the other towel; \"turn round.\"\n\nPeter was a much easier job than Ginger Dick, and arter Bill 'ad done 'im\n'e put 'im in alongside o' Ginger and covered 'em up, arter first tying\nboth the gags round with some string to prevent 'em slipping.\n\n\"Mind, I've only borrowed it,\" he ses, standing by the side o' the bed;\n\"but I must say, mates, I'm disappointed in both of you.  If either of\nyou 'ad 'ad the misfortune wot I've 'ad, I'd have sold the clothes off my\nback to 'elp you.  And I wouldn't 'ave waited to be asked neither.\"\n\nHe stood there for a minute very sorrowful, and then 'e patted both their\n'eads and went downstairs.  Ginger and Peter lay listening for a bit, and\nthen they turned their pore bound-up faces to each other and tried to\ntalk with their eyes.\n\nThen Ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off, but 'e\nmight as well 'ave tried to wriggle out of 'is skin.  The worst of it was\nthey couldn't make known their intentions to each other, and when Peter\nRusset leaned over 'im and tried to work 'is gag off by rubbing it up\nagin 'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper.  He banged\nPeter with his 'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till\nthey'd both got splitting 'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair\nand lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.\n\nAnd all this time Sam was sitting in the Red Lion, waiting for them.  He\nsat there quite patient till twelve o'clock and then walked slowly 'ome,\nwondering wot 'ad happened and whether Bill had gone.\n\nGinger was the fust to 'ear 'is foot on the stairs, and as he came into\nthe room, in the darkness, him an' Peter Russet started shaking their bed\nin a way that scared old Sam nearly to death.  He thought it was Bill\ncarrying on agin, and 'e was out o' that door and 'arf-way downstairs\nafore he stopped to take breath.  He stood there trembling for about ten\nminutes, and then, as nothing 'appened, he walked slowly upstairs agin on\ntiptoe, and as soon as they heard the door creak Peter and Ginger made\nthat bed do everything but speak.\n\n\"Is that you, Bill?\"  ses old Sam, in a shaky voice, and standing ready\nto dash downstairs agin.\n\nThere was no answer except for the bed, and Sam didn't know whether Bill\nwas dying or whether 'e 'ad got delirium trimmings.  All 'e did know was\nthat 'e wasn't going to sleep in that room.  He shut the door gently and\nwent downstairs agin, feeling in 'is pocket for a match, and, not finding\none, 'e picked out the softest stair 'e could find and, leaning his 'ead\nagin the banisters, went to sleep.\n\n[Illustration: \"Picked out the softest stair 'e could find.\"]\n\nIt was about six o'clock when 'e woke up, and broad daylight.  He was\nstiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light 'e stepped\nsoftly upstairs and opened the door.  Peter and Ginger was waiting for\n'im, and as he peeped in 'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their\n'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with\nbandages.  He was that startled 'e nearly screamed, and then 'e stepped\ninto the room and stared at 'em as if he couldn't believe 'is eyes.\n\n\"Is that you, Ginger?\" he ses.  \"Wot d'ye mean by making sights of\nyourselves like that?  'Ave you took leave of your senses?\"\n\nGinger and Peter shook their 'eads and rolled their eyes, and then Sam\nsee wot was the matter with 'em.  Fust thing 'e did was to pull out 'is\nknife and cut Ginger's gag off, and the fust thing Ginger did was to call\n'im every name 'e could lay his tongue to.\n\n\"You wait a moment,\" he screams, 'arf crying with rage.  \"You wait till I\nget my 'ands loose and I'll pull you to pieces.  The idea o' leaving us\nlike this all night, you old crocodile.  I 'eard you come in.  I'll pay\nyou.\"\n\nSam didn't answer 'im.  He cut off Peter Russet's gag, and Peter Russet\ncalled 'im 'arf a score o' names without taking breath.\n\n\"And when Ginger's finished I'll 'ave a go at you,\" he ses.  \"Cut off\nthese lines.\"\n\n\"At once, d'ye hear?\"  ses Ginger.  \"Oh, you wait till I get my 'ands on\nyou.\"\n\nSam didn't answer 'em; he shut up 'is knife with a click and then 'e sat\nat the foot o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em.  It wasn't the\nfust time they'd been rude to 'im, but as a rule he'd 'ad to put up with\nit.  He sat and listened while Ginger swore 'imself faint.\n\n\"That'll do,\" he ses, at last; \"another word and I shall put the\nbedclothes over your 'ead.  Afore I do anything more I want to know wot\nit's all about.\"\n\nPeter told 'im, arter fust calling 'im some more names, because Ginger\nwas past it, and when 'e'd finished old Sam said 'ow surprised he was\nat them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave\nprevented it.  He sat there talking as though 'e enjoyed the sound of 'is\nown voice, and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot\nsorrow it caused their friends.  Twice he 'ad to throw the bedclothes\nover their 'eads because o' the noise they was making.\n\n[Illustration: \"Old Sam said 'ow surprised he was at them for letting\nBill do it.\"]\n\n\"_Are you going--to undo--us?_\"  ses Ginger, at last.\n\n\"No, Ginger,\" ses old Sam; \"in justice to myself I couldn't do it.  Arter\nwot you've said--and arter wot I've said--my life wouldn't be safe.\nBesides which, you'd want to go shares in my money.\"\n\nHe took up 'is chest and marched downstairs with it, and about 'arf an\nhour arterward the landlady's 'usband came up and set 'em free.  As soon\nas they'd got the use of their legs back they started out to look for\nSam, but they didn't find 'im for nearly a year, and as for Bill, they\nnever set eyes on 'im again.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bill's Lapse, by W.W.
